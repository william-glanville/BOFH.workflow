One such assignment involved a lengthy deployment in Taiwan. The customer who must not be named either had two operational sites in Taipei - one which was a nicely set out server room in a high rise block, and the other was in a derelict factory in a very dodgy area. The factory was being ripped apart and undergoing 'civil reinforcement' to ensure it could withstand the island's regular earthquakes so to get into the place you had to climb over building waste and make your way through to the stairwell (the building wasn't lit) and climb 2 or 3 sets of stairs. Having successfully negotiated this commando course I was presented with the unbelievable sight of a 30 year old aircon unit which cooled about a third of the room, the rest being as hot as a mid summers afternoon at Ayer's rock. *(writes one reader, who obviously, must not be named)* Ironically enough, a few days later a typhoon tore through the island and brought a complete stop to the project. Unfortunately the fire alarm was activated in the nice shiny high rise building of the first site, setting off the water sprinkler in the server room. Exit stage right several million dollars worth of equipment. *(I've got a rather good story from when I was working at the BBC in London as a computer cleaning contractor. Every cable in the building ends up in the basement, as one nice big mess of spaghetti. The room immediately above this was decorated just after Christmas 2001. After painting this room, the decorators decided to tip their buckets of painty, murky water down a sink by the wall. This sink was not connected to anything. Said buckets of water proceeded to drop all over the floor and filter through a convenient hole)* As luck would have it, this hole was immediately above the hundreds of network ports which are so crucial to the BBC's operation. So myself and my boss get called in to scrub the cables and ports clean without unplugging a single one. Which we do. In a hot dusty basement and it takes us a whole day. By now the cleaning staff have been made aware of the mess upstairs. Obviously you can't have a floor covered in paint, so they mop it. And mop it they do. Cue paint shower number 2.

I could . But you're using more power than the distribution breaker should be handling - already. If I add any more circuits you'll probably trip the main breaker and bring down the computer room the next time a power supply blows. *(our Sparky responds)* It's on a UPS! *(the Boss says drily.)* Yeah,. Power Supply to Generator/Supply changeover switch tap, to UPS tap; to Switchboard tap; to Computer Room tap - with a couple of Isolating switches tap tap thrown in. *(our Sparky says, pointing out, in turn, the parts of the power circuit diagram)* Which means? The problem is after the UPS, *(the PFY says helpfully.)* Exactly,. A 100 KVA UPS breakered with a 80KVA circuit breaker which feeds a board currently running at 76KVA. *(our Sparky adds)* It means you have to replace the switchboard circuit breaker, *(the PFY says helpfully.)* And busbars to be on the safe side, *(the Sparky adds.)* What would that cost? *(the Boss asks.)* Ffffffffffffff.... . I'd have to get some prices. *(our Sparky sighs - in the way sparkies tend to do when they're trying to work out whether to go first or business class on their next holiday)* Prices? Yeah, circuit breakers, new switchboard, busbars, cable - which is a nightmare now with the price of copper - and cutout switches. Ballpark figure? *(the Boss asks.)* You're not going to have much change out of eight grand, *(he says, opting for the first class seats to Switzerland. And the expensive prostitute...)* \u00a38,000, *(the Boss chokes.)* Can't we keep the old switchboard - what would that cost then? *(the PFY suggests, conscious that the boss is borderline stroke material but the camcorder isn't charged...)* I suppose you could,. But then you'll move the problem to your breakers because you can't get that type any more - which means when one fails you're going to have to rig up some form of alternative - which can't be done live. *(the Sparky says sadly, seeing a downgrade to a ferry to Spain with the missus)* So we'd need to shutdown the computer room if one breaks? You'd need to shut it down every time one of them breaks, *(the Sparky responds, not giving up on Switzerland just yet.)* We can't do that! *(the Boss gasps.)* Perhaps we could increase the capacity of the main breaker to 120KVA which will allow for a little bit of leeway in the switchboard. Then we ASSUME that none of the breakers is going to fail in the next two years or so, and admit that as the busbars are overrated anyway we should survive. I... suppose that might work. How much will that cost? *(the Boss asks.)* A grand, *(our sparky says, barely allowing himself enough profit to take a cab to and from work for the next month...)* Well lets do that then! Okay,. So onto the UPS maintenance. *(the Sparky sighs)* What UPS maintenance? *(the Boss snaps suspiciously.)* Your annual UPS maintenance - what I came here for when you sidetracked me for more powerpoints. What's that going to cost - and for what? A grand or so,. I change the coolant, do a discharge test, retune the time-remaining figures, scan the batteries and electronics with a thermal imaging camera, check the error log, reset the error log, upgrade the UPS and monitor BIOS if necessary and then produce a site report. *(the Sparky says)* And you want a grand for that?", "response": "That's actually a pretty good deal, *(I say to the Boss.)*", "source_line": 9198}

Yeah, word's bound to get out. Unless... Unless? Well in the normal scheme of things we'd just use the toner cartridges and no one would be the wiser. And? Say the toner cartridges were to run out real fast - because someone printed thousands of pages of printouts every night for about a month? You're proposing we waste both toner cartridges and paper?! Hell yeah! If you send the toner cartridges back a credit'll be sent back to the company tied back to the original invoice which will cause the auditing beancounter to show an interest. If we just chuck the toner cartridges into the bin then the auditor will notice an anomaly in his spreadsheet between the consumption of paper and toner cartridges, but if we use toner cartridges and paper simultaneously it'll look like we just had a run on printing! But won't people notice the huge volumes of printouts and wonder why? Not if we get people to initiate the printouts themselves - with some pointless activity. So say we implement five or six new IT policies that all staff are supposed to familiarise themselves with, make them a bit geeky so people don't want to read them off the screen and cram them full of screenshot examples so they chew through the toner... There's got to be a better way! *(the Boss sniffs.)* Well we could... *(the PFY starts.)* Could what? Just chuck paper and toner cartridges into the bin at the same time. You're just going to toss them out? *(the Boss gasps.)* It'd look like they were just used up - no tricky questions... I... no, I can't! It's such a waste! Alternatively... *(I suggest.)* What? You could simply remove cartridges and paper, take them to another company who uses the same printers, sell them the discounted consumables for cash and then use the cash to buy new consumables for the new devices. No money comes or goes from the company's books and the company doesn't lose as much as the restocking fee Let me think.... .. .

Grab us a six pack of Tennants Super from your carry on will you? *(I say to the PFY)* What's the timeframe on the install of that videoconferencing device? *(the Boss asks, bowling into Mission Control, dressed, as the saying goes, like a pox doctor's clerk.)* Yeah, good, *(the PFY says looking up from the assorted pieces of hardware on his desk.)* No, I wanted the timeframe till it's in place, not a status. Oh right. Well I guess it'll be sorted inside of a week A week?! But I was told it'd arrived yesterday! Yep, so it'll be all installed and configured in a week. But you told me that it was a turnkey device , all you'd need to do is give it a network address? Uh-huh, and we'll do that when we rack it up. Can't you rack it up now? Not really. I mean it's going to take at least a day to put it back together. Put it back together?!. Why? What was wrong with it? *(the Boss gasps)* Nothing,. We just wanted to see how it works. It's quite good too - it boots off tap tap this hard drive here, but it's also got a slot for a flash card if you want to make it truly solid state. The kernel's a tiny Linux jobby that does a stack of sanity checking before handing off to the application. You can also set a jumper on this tap IO Card to tell the box to silently encode all conferences to one of the two drives in this tap tap media bay. AND it's got three NICs with inbuilt spike suppression, truly redundant power and the ability to battery backup to RAM tap here to hibernate the device should you wish to move it and boot it quickly in a portable configuration! *(the PFY says)* You... took it to bits?! *(The Boss finally gasps.)* Yeah, but we take all new kit to bits! But it says 'no user serviceable parts inside'! *(the Boss says, pointing at a small label on the lid.)* Yeah, that's just what they tell you to keep you stupid,. Besides, we're not users. *(the PFY responds)* But you've voided the warranty! Nah, they'll never know we've been in there, we'll rivet the case back up when we're done. Rivet? Yeah, we drilled the original rivets out - they tried to make it tamperproof. They'll know you drilled it out! No they won't, it'll look mint! *(the PFY says, brushing some metal shavings off the case.)* There's a great big gouge out of the side! Yeah, I sent a complaint in to the vendor saying it came like that. That way if it claps out we'll just claim it was damaged in transit. They'll check the box! This box? *(the PFY asks, pointing at a box with a large number of boot marks in it.)* But they'll still know you opened the machine! Nah they won't. The final assembly work is performed in Leeds - probably so that the company can bypass some import tariff or the other - so all we have to do is make it look like the last person who had it open was from Leeds. And how do you propose to accomplish that? Smear the lid with lardy fingerprints and drop a couple of chips and some pork scratchings inside the case. I... Oh, I almost forgot. I'll slip a bootleg of some blurry porn into the DVD drive. Uh... why? That way they'll know it's been inspected by quality control. You can't seriously believe... *(. . A week later . .)* And so we took it out of the box and it's a complete DOA, *(the PFY says to the engineer, as the Boss looks on nervously.)* Let's just have a look at it then,. It's probably just a power supply fault. *(the engineer says)* *(rattle)* Have you opened this case? *(he asks suspiciously.)* You can open it?. How? *(the PFY says)* No, no, you can't open it, it must have got damaged in transit, *(the engineer says.)* *(The PFY points to the Box and the engineer nods)* It's the shipping agent we use in the factory up north,.

It's plugged in one row of pins to the left of when it should be. *(he says, pointing)* What's that for? *(the PFY asks, pointing at a chip laying in the case.)* I... uhhh, that's just some packing, *(the engineer bluffs.)* It looks like a potato chip. Yeah, but it's not. It's one of those enviro carbon things. They're made out of... biomass and hexofibre - good for the atmosphere. And there's another one. *(He dumps the food into his pocket, shuts the lid and plugs the unit into a tiny debug console he's brought with him)* Righty-ho,. Let's see how she goes. *(he says)* *(An image promptly appears on the debug device and a self test starts)* All looks ok, *(the engineer said.)* So how did it get out of the factory like that?. Isn't there supposed to be some form of testing? *(the PFY says)* Yeah well, there should be, but it's possible this one got overl... *(He stops abruptly as a flabby backside wobbles its way across the screen)* ...might have just been damaged in transit, *(he says, pushing the eject button hurriedly.)* So we're all sorted then? *(the Boss asks.)* Yep, all up and running.

Your drinks. You said they were free! No, I said the coffee was free, but there's the chocolate to consider, cup licensing, cup hardware maintenance, cup support line subscription. What do you mean cup licensing? It's our cup and you're making use of it. Obviously, it will be returned to us, at which time it'll probably need some preventative hardware maintenance. You mean you have to wash it? We prefer to think of it as a total maintenance solution aimed at providing the best possible cup experience for the user. So what's the support line subscription about then? I hardly think we'd want to be paying that! Cup support line subscription is a compulsory product - you can't elect not to take it. So what do we get for the support line subscription? You get the ability to call our support line 24 hours a day. And what, you'll give us help if the drink has... made us ill? Possibly - if you ring us during work hours. You said it was a 24 hour line! The phone will ring any time of the day or night. So we'd have to leave a message then? Leaving messages would require an update to our Gold plan. So say I got ill tonight, if I'm on your Gold plan you'd sort me out with a medical attention? We'd sort you out with a doctor's phone number. From the Yellow Pages. On Monday morning. So we're not really getting much for Gold support then are we? No, you're right, Platinum is the best option. With Gold support we can probably help you with phone numbers, but Platinum support would get you my cellphone number and my firsthand knowledge of the way the coffee was made and what potential problems might arise - determined from our extensive logs of previous coffee drinkers. We also have an in depth knowledge of the various mocha ingredients - which may have contained traces of nut, I'm not sure. *(the PFY responds)* Neither of us has a nut allergy, *(#2 blurts.)* And we welcome coffee clients with a proactive attitude to their own maintenance programs! As I've said, neither the Gold nor Platinum support models are compulsory by any means - because we like to be fair to all our coffee clients, big and small, and try to tailor our coffee support model to truly reflect the use the coffee's being put to, the number of cups the user has a day, the size of the cup and the individual blend choices which each client may desire. So what if we choose not to buy your coffee in the first place? As you've already had about a third of the coffee you've pretty much already committed to the coffee experience - what with the restocking fee of \u00a350 and all - and to be brutally frank the cups you're drinking from were washed in a porcelain device not normally associated with food hygiene so I doubt that finishing the cup would have much difference at this stage. I would, however, stress that we would strongly recommend your upgrade to the Platinum support model so that we can aid in the 'debugging' exercise should you become violently ill in say... six or seven hours time... You... I know what you're going to say - you like the cut of our licensing gib? No,.

Our firewall has Intrusion Detection built into it, *(the PFY explains.)* So we're safe then? As safe as a domain with Windows 98, 98SE, ME, 2000, 2003, XP and 2007 can be. Not to mention the Macs in the coloured pencil office, *(I add.)* True. So 'not very' is probably the answer you're looking for, *(the PFY responds.)* Don't you think this might be a good opportunity to do something about it - and maybe get on top of a couple of other small jobs as well? You mean gather all the ancient and fruity crap into a pile and set fire to it? *(the PFY asks.)* I was thinking more along the lines of faking a break-in and chucking everything in the nearest skip. I MEANT upgrade everything to a safe operating system and... tackle a couple of other jobs while the upgrades are running. Ah. Well... We only have 15 days over the break - so that's the Windows updates out - and you'd never pay the overtime for it to be done properly. Yes, overtime.... Tricky... *(the Boss mumbles)* What's tricky? *(the PFY asks, smelling something in the wind...)* Given the current financial situation... *(the Boss starts.)* Yes, go on? ...the company's... er, suspended... um, overtime... Suspended overtime!. Next you'll be telling me there's no on-call allowance or Christmas bonus! *(the PFY gasps, before I can get to it)* Funny you should mention that... You're kidding! *(the PFY sniffs.)* Not at all - these are hard times and management have decided to tighten belts... Yes, yes,, but what has autoerotic strangulation got to do with overtime and Christmas bonuses? *(the PFY says)* Not to mention on-call allowances, *(I add.)* Senior Management have taken a pragmatic approach to cost-cutting by trying to reduce the larger expenses whilst keeping the company running. So they'll be taking a pay cut - being one of the largest expenses. Not exactly... *(the Boss responds evasively.)* Returning their excessive bonuses from previous years? Implementing a Senior Management salary freeze? Er... They gave themselves a pay increase, didn't they? Running a company in these harsh financial times isn't easy!. There's a lot of pressure. Hard decisions have to be made... *(the Boss blurts)* Yes,. The Clos du Mesnil '95 or the Clos du Mesnil '92 - It's a tough choice at the best of times. I'm surprised they didn't outsource the decision to one of their wives, college chums or 'nieces'. *(the PFY nods knowingly)* Ah. Yes. Speaking of outsourcing... You're not... suggesting we end the outsourcing of our server room and servers?! *(I gasp, watching 'the life to which I have become accustomed' draining away.)* I'm afraid so. They've done the numbers and remote-hosting our services is far more expensive than doing them in-house. We're going to have to cancel the contract. But there'll be penalty payments,. And we'll have to buy servers! *(I wheeze)* And get someone to extend the server room, *(the PFY adds.)* Yes, well, we sort of hoped...", "response": "*(the PFY says.)* Wait a minute,.

A surprise dwarfed by that which awaited me when I looked up the directors of our server hosting outfit at the companies office.

Sharon then meets women through Candice and Lord Peter and talks up Jerry as a caring guy who's only been forced into the Traffic Warden game because he lost his job, but still wants to support the three kids in the third world that he sponsors.

No. Phone - are you synchronising with that? No. OK, so we're at the point of 'Whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth'. What do you mean? Well the only thing that's changed is that we added 'Goat Fetish' to the client filters. WILL YOU STOP WITH THE GOAT FETISH CRAP!? No, what I'm saying is that's the ONLY thing that WE have changed with the mail system in the past month-and-a-half. So I suspect that somehow you're triggering this. How? I don't know.

What money? *(the Boss asks, suppressing excitement.)* *(The PFY knows this, but still every now and then he throws a pearl into the void)* What he's trying to say, is that sometimes it's good to keep things close to you \u2013 for efficiency. *(I blurt, deciding to help the PFY)* How do you mean? Well in your case you might keep a couple of stale lard sandwiches in your top drawer to save you driving home to get your wife to rustle up a culinary delight every time you get peckish. Oh, I just use the vending machine downstairs. Not the point,. But to explain further: if you have something that you use often it's better to keep it close than having to do all the work of going and getting it. You know \u2013 like how your wife keeps a copy of the book 'Coping with disappointment' on her bedside table instead of in the bookshelf. *(I snap)* Or how you might keep cash in your wallet, because it's quicker to pull your wallet out instead of going to the bank every time you need to pay for something *(the PFY adds, interrupting the Boss' thought processes before he gets offended.)* I... see. So in our case, while we might put all our data into the cloud somewhere what we're also doing is KAY-SHING our data locally. That way we have a local copy on the fast network as well as a backup \u2013 and remote access copy \u2013 in the cloud. So it would be quicker than waiting for the cloud? *(the Boss asks hesitantly.)* For our on-site users, yes. Off-site users would use the cloud, which would probably end up being faster for them. So is our copy of the data called a 'near side cache'? *(the Boss asks.)* No, it's just called a cache. But it's near us, *(he whines.)* It is, but most all caches are near \u2013 so the whole 'near-side' crap is what we call 'operationally redundant'. It would be like saying acne-ridden deep fryer operator , because all deep fryer operators are acne ridden. Or saying Idiot Boss because al- Or money-grabbing, lying, pre-sales person. So in the end we have this cache and it stores all the data we use most commonly \u2013 and because it's near it means that we won't be slowed down with accessing our data from the cloud \u2013 AND if there's an internet outage we can keep on working. *(the PFY says, again interrupting)* Internet outage?! *(the Boss gasps.)* *(The PFY is on a roll today and I realise there was a line missing from my boss-brain-flowchart between what's-in-it-for-me and lunchtime)* ..I thought we had redundant internet? *(he asks)*", "response": "We do have redundant internet, *(I say, but every now and then there's a possibility that a particular outage would be common to both of them.\")*", "source_line": 18090}

Well the GPS signal might not work inside the building, and they have the inertia of a dwarf star so the accelerometer is probably not going to read anything at all and they spend most of their time on their chair or on the bog, so no, probably not. Hmm,. What about inside the office? *(the Boss says, thinking hard.)* Let's see. I could put a wireless device that would tell you when the light was on, but your internal wall has glass in it.

I don't see how that's relevant. The floor below us is TWO AND A HALF FEET of steel-reinforced concrete. The one above us is TWO feet thick. This area of the building was required to be standing at the end of the apocalypse, and the server room was designed to be right where it is now \u2013 you can still see the bracing rails for the original PDP-11s under the raised floor. So? So the company that bought the building before us ALSO put their server room in this location, as we did after them. It's the only logical place. Why? It's the only place with access to the risers; everywhere else in the building is blocked off by masses of concrete structure. The only real ducts in the building lead from this space; everything else is sloppy catenary wires and poorly drilled holes. You could put everything in the basement. That has access to the risers.

At present the PFY and I are only one point behind the bloke that pumps out the grease trap in the cafeteria \u2013 and he only comes on site every three months!

There's a stub in the helpdesk system but the rest of the job is in THE system. What's THE system? Well,. You know those early computer Eliza programs? *(the PFY says, looking around furtively)* No. They're an example of natural language processing. The basic idea is that you think you're talking to a real person but in reality you're talking to a program which will just solicit information without ever reaching an outcome. But it does sound interested, *(I add.)* Yes, *(the PFY continues. So we get an emailed problem from the helpdesk system which is directed into THE system. THE system will grab the job number and reply to the user via the helpdesk system, typically triggering an ERFI, which will be answered through the helpdesk system.)* Back and forth it will go until the user does one of four things: Sends an email out of the blue without the job number in the subject line (which will open a new job and close and expunge any previous similar job by the same person, restarting the ERFI process again). Ring us (which does nothing because we don't answer the phone). Ring you (which does nothing because the job's in the system). Complains to someone higher up the food chain \u2013 which we normally counter by showing that they have failed to supply all the information. After which we 'review the call in detail' \u2013 which can't be done while the job is open \u2013 expunge the job \u2013 to prevent any job duplication issues \u2013 and open a new call. But what we're really waiting for is the abuse. The what now? *(the Boss asks.)* The abuse. When they finally crack because it looks like no matter how many questions they answer they will never get the solution to their problem. When that happens we trigger the workplace harassment process off and because we're an involved party we are no longer able to work on that user's problems. It's a pretty sweet arrangement,. I may need to go on stress leave soon. *(the PFY says)* Because of the harassment, *(I add.)* Look,, I just want to know where this job is at. *(the Boss sighs)* Well, I suppose we could track it for you?
