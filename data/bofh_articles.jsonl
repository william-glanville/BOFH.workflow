Well, 4.5 if we're to be completely honest and subtract food\/beverage and newspaper breaks. \nHowever, as they say, you're paid for what you know, not what you do... \n\"So what you're saying is that he's extremely overpaid?\" the PFY asks when I explain these facts to him. \n\"Why do you say that?\" \n\"Cos he knows bugger all!\" \n\"Well he won't be a computing jack-of-all-trades like us -- his forte is no doubt the accounting application and it's installation.\" \n\"So why's he reading the upgrade documentation?\" \n\"A lot of this stuff is highly complex, with hundreds of pre-upgrade procedures to be carried out,\" I remind him. \"So he's probably performing the checklists. What section is he reading at the moment?\" \n\"The introduction -- entitled 'How to use this documentation'.\" \n\"Well, he's probably...\" \n\"He's been reading it for an hour now..\" \n\"Ah\" \n\"Ah?\" \n\"Ah. Meaning, it sounds like we've got a suck-it-and-see upgrader.\" \n\"Suck it and see?\" \n\"The old-fashioned way of checking if mains cable was live\" \n\"You'd suck a cable?\" \n\"Don't be silly -- that's dangerous! You'd get an apprentice to do it!\" \n\"Oh. So what does it mean now?\" \nIt means I think he'll skim the upgrade text, ensure we have a complete backup of the system, then rush blindly into the upgrade, accepting all defaults -- KNOWING that he can recover the data if needed. \n\"Ah.\" \n\"Precisely. And if it works, he comes out looking smokingly good at his job, if not there's 'some incompatibility with our software or with the upgrade pack' and we roll back.\" \n\"Rollback?\" \n\"Yes, it's a nice way of saying that you've made a pig's breakfast of the whole thing and want the evidence erased by a recovery.\" \n\"Has anyone ever called you cynical?\" \n\"They may have, but they're just bitter..\" \nOur conversation ends seconds later with the reappearance of the person concerned, complete with upgrade manual and highlighter pen. \n\"Ah, just checking that you've taken a full system backup before I start.\" \n\"Sure have!\" I lie, nudging the snapshot tapes into the bin as he leaves the room. \n...Several Hours later... \n\"I'm afraid we'll need to rollback the upgrade\" \n\"Oh, why's that?\" \n\"Looks like there's an incompatibility between your revision of the Database code and the version the upgrader expects\" he murmurs. \nThe needle on my desktop Bollockometer wanders off-scale for a moment or ten. \n\"Sure,\" I cry, grabbing a tape from the pile of read-errored duds on my desk. \n..10 Minutes Later... \n\"I'm afraid the tape we wrote has read errors and is unrecoverable,\" I report. \n\"I...\" he gasps. \"Didn't you read it to verify it?\" \n\"Of course\" I respond, ignoring the ticking sound as the Bollockometer clocks itself \"but my guess is that the read pass must have been the straw that broke the camel's back -- media-wise!\" \n\"Can't you recover ANY of the data?\" \n\"Nope, the error's at the beginning of the tape -- as you'd expect of the most used area of magnetic media,\" I burble. \n\"Oh dear,\" he says, only minorly apologetic. \"Our statement of indemnity clearly states that we're not responsi..\" \n\"Statement of indemnity?\" \n\"Yes, as a matter of course we get a signatory from our clients to indemnify us if there are problems as a result of the upgrade. I have it with me in my brie.. ..Hmm, it's in here somewhe...\" \n\"Oh dear. Don't tell me you've forgotten to get an indemnity form signed. And I just BET you're a private contractor who signed an indemnity form with your agency indemnifying THEM ?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Which means it'll be you *personally* that our company will be pursuing for damages...\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Unless, of course... But then...\" \n\"Unless what?!?!?!\" \n\"Well unless of course you re-enter all the data from the ruined tables into the database before the beancounters get in the morning...\" \n\"But the corrupt table's got about 200,000 rows!\" \n\"Yep, it'd take ages to re-enter. Unless you somehow managed to bribe all the women in our D.P. Pool to do it for you...\" \n\" COULD I?!?! \" he gasps. \n\"I dunno -- sounds a bit pricey to me!\" the PFY chirps, right on time \"You'd be lookingat, I dunno, a couple of grand.\" \n\"I can manage two thousand pounds!\" he blurts. \n\"Ah, that would be THREE thousand pounds -- by the time my assistant, myself,and the Head of DP are taken into account.\" \n\"Would you take a ch..\" \n\" CASH . If you hurry you could get it before the banks close and the DP staff leave.\" \nIt takes about 10 minutes for him to rocket out of the building and collect the wherewithal to make the transaction. I assure him the DP people will work till it's done, or take the blame themselves for the error -- which appeases his distress largely. \nAs soon as he's gone, I slip the PFY his share (500 quid) ignoring his protestations. \n\"Was it YOU who split the disk mirror this very morning?\" I ask whilst invalidating the data on the upgrade disk with a few well-placed keystrokes and bringing the old version Online with only a few more. \"Was it YOU who stole the indemnity form from his briefcase? I think not! You got paid for your two parts in this -- your estimate of the DP Pool cost at the right moment..\" \n\"And?\" \n\"Those pints you're about to buy me!\" \n\"Of course!\" ® \nBOFH is owned by Simon Travaglia: don't mess with his copyright \n"}

Look, you're even filling in Job Sheets! 'Reset user's password'. Helped a user with a Microsoft Office install'.\" \n\"Just noting work done to aid the service process.\" \n\"You HATE job forms - You used to steal them from the helpdesk just to prevent them getting work bonuses! You said it was Virtual Brownnosing.\" \n\"I said it was VIRTUALLY Brownnosing. Virtual Brownnosing's where you get one of those greeting card places to send your boss a birthday card every year. In any case, that's a very negative point of view.\" \nThe PFY's next diatribe is pre-empted by the rapid arrival of The Boss. \n\"Just wanted to thank you for the help with my home machine; it's running much faster now!\" \n. . . \n\"You helped THE BOSS , with a HOME machine!!? You HAVE lost it! It's not going to affect next week's Contract Renegotiation any!\" \n\"Contract Renegotiation? I have transcended the need for wealth and power by donating my savings to the Mahariji's trust and don't feel the need to encourage favour with my superiors.\" \nSUPERIOR!!! You've gone SOFT! \" the PFY cries disgustedly. \" I KNEW something was up when you let that Security Guy get the better of you. The OLD Bastard would never have let that happen! \n\"The OLD Bastard was a relic. Not at all in tune with his aura.\" \n\"His Aura?\" \n\"Yes, the mantra of his personal consciousness.\" \n\"Personal Consciousness?! It's that Engineer, isn't it! She's got you wrapped around her finger!\" \n\"I have to admit that our relationship was sweet, but the Mahariji showed me that it was simply a manifestation of my own deep-seated needs. The relationship ended and I am a fuller person now because of it.\" \n\"You're a fuller Nutter now!\" \n\"I'm sure the OLD Bastard would have responded to that statement with negativity - probably manufacturing some cataclysmic sequence of events for which you would be blamed... But I will not. The Mahariji has shown me that helping others is the only path to true aura maintenance.\" \nNutter! the PFY repeats. \n\"The Mahariji says that namecalling is a manifestation of sadness. The Shiny Aura is rewarded by happiness.\" \n\"Fifty quid says I'll be the happier person at the end of the day.\" \n\"A wager? I do not need money!\" \n\"One hundred quid!\" he cries. \n\"I don't rea..\" \n\" FIVE HUNDRED QUID! \" \n\"Please stop!\" , I cry. \"This is unseemly! I will take your wager on the condition that you pay my winnings - if it happens - to the Mahariji!\" \n\"Done!\" \nThe deal is struck once my assistant has added a side wager that the loser has to buy the entire IT department drinks on Friday night - AND listen to their complaints about service. Not something that even an enlightened individual would look forward to.. \nWe've barely shaken on it when we're summoned to The Boss's office - no doubt to receive more thanks for problems solved... \n\"Ah... I've just had a complaint about some of the service the users have been receiving!\" The Boss mutters sternly, looking in the PFY's direction. \nThe PFY, as expected, looks away with an expression of innocence... \nSigh. \n\"I must apologise for my assistant's youth,\" I interrupt. \"He's young and impulsive and sometimes doesn't give the client the benefit of the doubt, but I'm sure that with a little...\" \n\"Enough!\" The Boss snaps. \"Changing a user's password to a disgusting word repeated three times isn't what I'd call impulsive - it's a calculated act!\" \n\"?\" the PFY responds, before I can step in for his defence. \"Probably some form of misunderstanding on my assistants part,\" I add. \"He may have thought that the user had REQUESTED that password - some of them have a history of using fairly colourful language when a problem occurs. It may be that he thought that they were supplying that word as a password - it has happened.\" \n\"Oh yes? And what about telling a user that Microsoft Office installs faster if you hammer all the developer CDs into the drive at once?\" \n\"I... I..,\" I murmur, looking at the PFY in horror. \nWhich, as it happens, is the same way he's looking at me. Of course he's thinking of my new credibility as opposed to his (should he claim it was me) and the 500 quid down the gurgler PLUS eight or so hours of people whining about how the systems used to run faster back when, and how they like one letter passwords... Not to mention his chances come Contract Renegotiation time... \n\"Leave it with me,\" I murmur to The Boss. \"I'll have a little word with him...\" \n. . . \n\"You bastard!\" the PFY shouts when we get back to Mission Control. \"This Mahariji stuff's a load of crap! Well laugh again. The deal was 500 quid to the Mahariji, so the cheques going there.\" \n\"Excellent!\" I cry. \"Would you like me to send you one of our pamphlets as well - I've just finished one on the Divine Shiny Aura.\" \n\"You're the Mahariji?\" \n\"You betcha! I bought up the office of this New Age fruit- eating commune after they had a bad batch of apples or something and closed down - and now have an iron-clad tax haven. For a couple of years anyway! Absolutely brilliant. So all I have to do is print a couple of pamphlets a year, advertise dull meditation courses in some well-known magazines, publish a massive yearly loss and I'm in the clear! Unless of course the Beatles reform..\" \n\"So who should I make the cheque out to?\" the PFY asks, sighing heavily. \n\"The Divine Aura of Tfosorcim Society.\" \n\"Tfosorcim?

BOFH newbies can tune into previous episodes \n. So let's get cracking. \nBOFH 2000 No. 1 \nIt's still dark as I let myself back into my soon-to-be-EX workplace with a spare \"backup\" access card and stroll into the office after a short break of feigned death... \nThere's nothing like a quick fatality to put the life back into you.. \nSlipping into Mission Control quietly, I notice the PFY, bless him, has a tear or two in his eye as he reaches into my filing cabinet to put my belongings into a plain cardboard box... and a couple more when I slam the drawer on his hand. \n\"Now what have I told you about fingering my possessions?\" I ask. \n\"B.. but.. you're... you're.. \" he blurts, extricating his fingers gingerly. \n\".. Alive and well?\" I finish. \n\"But.. what about....\" \n\"Arty Murray?\" I interject again. \"Last I saw of him, he'd just plummeted through the shoddily thin sub-basement floor into the building's stormwater outfall pipe and was probably being washed toward the Thames.. Messy business..\" \n\"How did you..?\" \n\"Escape Unscathed? By a one in a hundred chance, a loop of thickwire Ethernet cable (which I'm sure I told you to remove from a cabling riser over a YEAR ago) was mysteriously stuffed in the faller ducting instead .. where I theoretically wouldn't find it..\" \nThe PFY looks away guiltily as I continue... \n\".. Which hooked round one of my legs on the way down. Causing me considerable personal injury less than a yard of drop later. But don't worry, my extended absence (for recuperation) will of course be charged back to the company, as will the extensive medical bills from Doctors J Beam and Daniels. \" \n\"OhI'mSoPleasedYou'reBack!\" the PFY gushes with all the self-control of a Microsoft Fan in the Master Bedroom of Gatesland. \"Things have been terrible!\" \n\"Terrible?\" I require. \n\"Everyone at IT's been reshuffled, they're going to put us under the Beancounters, and there's been a freeze on spending.\" \n\"So, business as per usual then?\" \n\" I DON'T THINK SO! \" The boss cries triumphantly, entering the office with all the grace and poise of a large tusk-bearing animal. After 10 buckets of lager. \n\"Why's that?\" I ask politely. \n\"Because you don't WORK here any more!,\" he cries happily, pointing out the unexplained absence clause in my contract. \n\"Of course I don't work here any more - it was touch and go when I WAS working here. No, I have my sites set on greener pastures. By the way, any Y2K problems?\" \n\"It's a nightmare!,\" the PFY admits. \"You name it, it's failing - even the stuff that's only about six months old.\" \n\"Excellent, so my work wasn't in vain then!\" \n\"You sabotaged our systems!,\" the boss burbles. \n\"Of course not. You said you wanted all our systems Y2K complaint ready.\" \n\"I said compl-IA-nt!\" \n\"No, you distinctly said COMPLAINT . I know, I kept a copy.\" \n\"W... \" the boss burbles, nudging his vocab up a fraction. \n\"Mine not to reason why!

(Only three more left, which'll be worth gold after the card readers slip into erase-mode for leap day.) \nSo I enter the job market, and find a suitable position within a couple of hours. A couple of hours later I break out my suit from long-term storage and attend an interview. \nIt went fairly well as interviews go - I told them what they wanted to hear, laughed at their IT jokes that were so old they were printed in braille on the back of the UNIVAC, and generally impressed them with my computing worldiness. \nSickening, I agree. \n\"Just one question\" I chime in: \"How agressively do you persue new technology?\" \n\"We believe in growth, and now we've got you, we can go 'leading edge'. Sure, it'll cost a bit more, and involve a bit of travel to track down the right solution, but we think it's just the price you have to pay to get ahead of the competition.\" \n\"Dosh and Travel, my favourite twinset... Quicker than you can say \" I'm on the team! I'm on the team. \n. . . \n\"And here's your workstation - it cost a bomb, and it's the latest and fastest, I believe.\" \n\"It's a Digital VT1000 'X' terminal! They don't even make them any more.\" \n\"Yes, refurbished to top-of-the-line our consultant told us.\" \n\"It's Mono!\" \n\"Too fast for colour, he said.\" \nA quick scan of the computer room (full of VAXes, Sparc-1s and a couple of NEXTs for show) and facts-of-life talk later appraises him of the shafting that they've been getting. \n\"What should we do?\" \n\"Well there's a lot of work, I won't be able to do it on my own. We'll need an IT manager too...\" \n. . . \n\"Yep?\" the PFY answers shirtily (I'm so proud - taught him everything you know). \n\"Hi, it's Opportunity - knocking. And give the boss a yell too - I hear there's a vacancy he might be interested in before the end of February.\" \nJust like old times - back in the driver's seat once more... ® \nBOFH belongs to Simon Travaglia.

You get called by the most recent in a looooong line of saleswomen for a large software company. Judging from past experience, she'll be absolutely gorgeous and know as much about computing as Sonny Bono did about skiing through trees. She proceeds to tell you that the product she's just received, which, believe it or not, is the best thing that she's ever seen. You know immediately: A. It's an excellent and well-researched product B. It's probably a fairly good product C. It's crap D. There is no product, they're selling vaporware, but you're going to buy one anyway. \n2. An Engineer visits your site and, after setting a new speed record for ripping the guts out of your kit and stuffing most of it back in the box, pronounces it fixed and ready for action. This means: A. It'll work till he gets back to the office B. It'll work till he gets to his car C. It'll work till he gets in the lift D. He's turned it off at the wall so that it won't catch fire till he's out of the building \n3. One of your users calls up to see what sort of back-ups you keep. He assures you that he has NOT deleted any files at all, and his system is sound. This means: A. He's just checking on back-up policy out of interest B. He's deleted a file that it would take a small amount of time to recreate C. He's deleted a file that it would take a large amount of time to recreate D. He's deleted someone ELSE's file, and now knows not to own up to it \n4. The beancounters deep-six one of your equipment purchase orders because they say it's too expensive. What they REALLY mean is: A. It's too expensive B. It's slightly expensive, and more research might find a less expensive option. C. They say that to anything over 50 quid. D. They want a morning of power surges and file share outages. \n5. Your Boss rolls into your office with a fist full of Purchase orders that haven't yet been signed. He tells you that he's going to need justification documents for the kit you've proposed to buy. He obviously means: A. He has to answer to the Head of Department like everyone else B. He has to justify expenditure like everyone else C. He's no what the kit IS, but doesn't want to look stupid. D. He's got his eyes set on a new laptop+desktop combo, which your purchases are going to put the kybosh on. \n6. Security sends a memo around informing everyone that they'll be running their usual site-safety workplace\/office check in the next few days. What they really mean is: A. Office safety is paramount and they're concerned about accidents B. Office security is paramount and they're concerned about break-ins C. They've noticed the similarity between the marks on the door of the vending machines and the pry bar that you keep for \"floor tile removal\" D. The head of security wants his safe back. \n7. You're reading a trade mag which tells you that a certain popular operating system of the 80s is making a comeback. In plain terms this means: A. Serious development has produced results at OS\/2 central B. Serious money has produced results at VMS central C. Guru Meditation has produced results at Amiga central D. Alcohol has produced results at the editorial office \n8. You're looking for new staff when a slave trader rings you with a fantastic person to join your team. From your experience with slave traders, you know: A. The applicant will be perfect for your needs B. The applicant will probably be OK C. The applicant will probably recognise a computer if they see one D. The applicant won't find their way to your office \n9. You're at a trade show where the latest and greatest hardware is available for perusal. The demonstrator of the kit in front of you (which looks EXACTLY like the kit the boss bought last year) tells you that their product is the new version with twice the performance for half the cost!!! You realise: A. The kit is AMAZING! B. The kit sounds amazing C. The boss would think it was amazing D. It's amazing they had the balls to turn up at the show! \nHow did you do? \nMostly A You are green aren't you? Are you sure you're not Management reading forbidden literature? Meantime I have an attractive land package in Leeds known for it's tourist draw-card mini-putt course... \nOr maybe YOU'RE the Manager in the pie. I know there's one in here somewhere, sniffing about. \nThat's more like it. The tinge of cynicism and worldly experience. With a little bit of practice you could become and asset to society. \nCOME ON DOWN! We have a winner!

And wouldn't you know it, because of a minor statistical anomaly in the workplace accident figures, the Computer Room is found to be the most dangerous place in the Building. \nAs it should be. \nStill, The PFY and I are REQUIRED to attend the course, which isn't so bad when you consider the company's picking up the Tab for a day off work. \nAnd we do get a shiny first aider badge. \nTo wear to the pub. \nAt our respective wakes. \n\"Yes, that IS the correct way to use a defibrillator,\" our instructor informs The PFY calmly. \"However it's not generally the recommended method for treating a broken arm, which is what we're looking at currently.\" \nWith a sigh The PFY puts down the paddles of the unit, which is no doubt suffering from a seriously depleted battery and leaves the resuscitation manikin to smoulder out. \n\"Now back to broken arms; what's the best treatment for them?\" \n\"It depends on how they were broken..\" The PFY answers, beating everyone in the assembled group for our tutor's attention, like the closet brownnoser he is. \n\"Yes, true,\" she responds. \"If the fracture is what we call an 'Open' fracture, we would want to treat it differently than a normal 'Closed' fracture.\" \n\"Oh. I was thinking more along the lines of 'did I slam their arm in a door, and should I give it a twist to make my point - for luck'. Sort of thing.\" \n\"Yessss..\" she replies, clearly deciding not to dig any deeper into that particular quagmire. \"Anyway, what we're looking at is whether there is bleeding associated with the injury or not, and whether there's a necessity to treat that first.\" \nThe Boss, meantime (here because he too values the idea of a day out of the office) is looking just a tad queasy - obviously not too keen on the blood idea.. \nBest go easy on him. \n\"Blood you say,\" I cry loudly, \"Would that be like a LOT of blood?\" \n\"Well it depends really on the organs involved, and how they're affected.\" \n\"So the blood could just GUSH out, ALL OVER everything, or if could just OOOOOZE ?\" \nThe Boss is now looking like a Procol Harum song and starting to waver in his chair, which is the perfect time for an interlude... \n\"I think we need to get him some fresh air,\" I cry, pointing out The Boss to the instructor. \n\"Yes, yes, very good idea.\" \n\"I'll bring the shock machine!\" The PFY cries, leaping toward the device in question. \n\"That won't be necessary\" she responds, \"All he needs is a little lie down in some cool air for a minute or two.\" \nThe PFY barely hides his disappointment, but rallies -- by snaffling The Boss's wallet and standing on his personnel disorganiser -- while helping him to the window. A gust of fresh diesel fumes to the nostrils and The Boss is back in the Land of the Living. \n\"Where's my wallet!?!\" he cries, performing his Power on Self Test true to form. \n\"Here it is,\" The PFY offers, \"Just looking after it.\" \nThe Boss scrabbles through it, but everything seems to be intact. \nTen minutes later we've all seen a sling in action and managed to pair up to give it a try ourselves. I, sadly didn't quite get the hang of it, so to speak, and mistakenly wrapped the noose - I mean bandage - around The Boss's neck. And it's true what they say about a well-tied reef knot - it doesn't slip. \nAfter The Boss has his second bout of fresh air, we begin again, pausing during the bleeding stage for The Boss to recover yet again. Sigh. \nThe next day we're all back on fine form and I'm showing The Boss some of the sights of the computer room. He wants to go through every SINGLE bloody accident that's ever happened in the place and see if our course has covered it - before he pays this invoice. Sigh. \n. . . \n\"And this is where that engineer slipped and tripped down the raised floor tile - breaking his arm - which incidentally that accident happened the very day after he told us that we didn't have 24 hour response..\" \n\"Yes, yes,\" The Boss murmurs, ticking off something on his clipboard. \"We'll have to put up warning signs on the walls about that.\" \n\"..Oh! And this is where we had that mild electric shock when wear and tear on the power cable accidentally connected phase to this cabinet. Nasty burn and a bit of hysteria there.\" \n\"Yes, perhaps we should make it a rule that everyone entering the room has to use insulated gloves,\" he burbles. \n\"Ah\" The PFY cries, \"This is where that consultant who was always complaining about not having access to the computer room accidentally climbed on top of the machine. And this is where he broke off one of the smoke detectors with his head - causing the halon to be released.\" \n\"Really - he broke it off with his head?\" \n\"Near as we can tell - he quit after the accident, so we didn't have a chance to ask him about it.\" \n\"Yes. Those consultants all have First Aid certificates, don't they? I know, I've got an idea! Why not let them all have access to the computer room - which should increase the safety of the area many times over!\" \n!!! \n\"Let them into my computer room?\" I ask. \n\"Yes,\" The Boss replies happily. \n\"Well I suppose so,\" I respond, ignoring The PFY's look of horror. \"They certainly would have come in handy that time I cut my finger on the sharp edge of the inside of this cabin... oh look, I've done it again!\" \nI pull my arm out of the cabinet and sure enough there's a large cut along it with a generous amount of blood on it. \n\"And this,\" I say, indicating a stretch of floor tile to The PFY, \"is where The Boss fainted that time and >KATHUD<  broke >STOMP<<\/b> his index finger.\" \nDesperate times, desperate measures. \nYou'll get access to my computer room right after you pry the Halon test key out of my cold, lifeless hands. ® \nBOFH is the Bastard Operator from Hell.

I've tried to calm down, I've counted to 10, I've even played a couple of games of sneaky-cheat Quake II against a couple of feebs from marketing who can't figure out why they kept exploding when I shot them with an ordinary looking pistol. \nBut it's not working. I've had enough. The week has gone on one day too long and they've finally got to me. The users, The Boss - even the PFY is getting on my tits.... \n..It all started this morning when I had to put a simple proposal in for the purchase of a swag of new disks to replace the old crap that sits in a standalone cabinet hanging off a SCSI-1 chain on one of the larger Database machines. Disk that's so old it's got marks from Noah's screwdriver on the side. And he wasn't much of an installer if the cabling's anything to go by... \nBe that as it may, I slap together a quick document and push it over to The Boss. \n\"There's no competing quote for the equipment,\" he says, skimming down the page. \n\"Company policy is that a competing quote isn't necessary when the purchase is under 2000 quid,\" I respond. \n\"Yes, but there's several disks here, which, with VAT, totals... 2014 pounds,\" he replies, after bashing some numbers into his desktop calculator and – finally - managing to get them in the right order. \nSo 10 minutes later I'm back in his office with TWO orders for two sets of half as many disks. \nAnd he signs them off. Well, wanders off to the secretary to borrow her dictionary to see just whether Disc or Disk is the preferred spelling. \n\"I can't believe you did two orders to avoid getting a competing quote,\" he says smugly as he returns, just letting me know that I can't put one over on him. \nI've no doubt his smugness will last well up to the time he discovers the wallet on his desk strangely empty, his coffee cup strangely full, and his voicemail diverted to a phone sex line. \nI take the order up to Beancounter Central, only to find the beancounters won't be processing it today. (It's Accounts policy to send out all orders in the morning mail. And by now it's past 11am.) \nMy offers to type it myself are rejected. There are no exceptions. Rules are rules. \nBut that's OK, I can put up with that . Then I get back to Mission Control and the PFY's having a deep and meaningless with the latest woman of his dreams... \n\"I *SO* agree\" he gushes, gesturing to a console message warning of a tape drive needing a cleaning cartridge. \nBeing the benevolent type, I slap the tape in the drive and pop down to an early lunch. \nAnd wouldn't you know it, I'm just getting my second pint in when a group of furry-teethed geeks from the electronics company down the road bowl in. \n\"And I said to him: 'you can't port Debian to a car computer - IT'S NOT AN OPEN SYSTEM' - WAAAAA HA HA HA! \" one of them cries, setting the rest of them off in a fit of laughter. \n... \nI make a break back to work only to find The PFY on the phone, the Tape warnings still unresolved, a consultant wanting someone to help him with his computing problem (which he no doubt caused), and a couple of users stacked up on hold because all the helldesk people have gone to lunch at the same time... \nSomething has to be done. \nI get rid of the users in record time with a two-word solution involving sex and travel (disguising my phone line as a helldesk extension in case any of the callers has a digital phone), and then decide to tackle the PFY problem. \nI indicate the tape warnings that he's been ignoring for the last hour or two then show him the plug of death, which to all intents and purposes looks like a plug with a single throw heavy duty switch where the cable should be. Not knowing what it is, the PFY seems unfazed. \nWhich incidentally is what his desk and phone are when I plug in then push the button, grounding the live wire and popping the circuit breaker. \n\"What the hell di..,\" The PFY starts, stopping abruptly when he sees me passing a small parcel to him. He knows two things: (1) the mailroom only delivers parcels at 10 and 3, and (2) most parcels don't have highly conductive tin foil on them. \"I'll just get those tapes then..\" \nProblem solved, it remains only for the attack of the killer consultant with his problem of doom. Sure enough, seeing me alone in the office, separated from the herd as it were, he decides to strike. \n\"I've been having a few problems installing NT,\" he burbles, wandering over and showing me a piece of paper with the \"error text\" written on it. \"There's no floppy in the drive,\" I murmur. \n\"No, there ISN'T a floppy in the drive!\" he cries triumphantly. \nSigh \n\"The machine doesn't recognise the CD drive and NEEDS a boot floppy to load the NT disk,\" I respond. \n\"No it doesn't! It's never needed one before.\" \nDouble sigh \n\"It does. It's uncommon, but it happens.\" \n\"Look, I should know, I install these things all the time!\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" I sigh yet again, then have a minor brainstorm. \" OH , Actually! What service pack is the CD you're using.\" \n\"Six.\" \n\"Ah, use Seven, it has the CD drivers built right into the CD.\" \n\"But how does that work?\" \n\"You've heard of data readahead?\" \n\"No?\" \n\"Well this is the same thing, it's an enhanced readahead which allows the system to cache the driver for the CD.\" \nThe glazed expression tells me all I need to know about the credibility of that particular lie. \n\"DuhOK.\" \n\"Help yourself, they're in that silver package over there...\" \nOne high-pitched scream later, a small battery powered inverter kit drops to the floor. The Boss, ever on the alert for something to make his day pass quicker, investigates. \n\"What's going on here?\" he asks ignoring the doubly glazed expression on the consultant sitting in a courier basket. \n\"Oh he's just pleased because the latest enhancement to Solitaire arrived today.\" \n\" YOU'VE GOT A BETTER SOLITAIRE! \" the boss gasps, his day peaking. \n\"Yeah, the install disks are in the shiny parcel on the floor - haven't had a chance to..\" \n>EEEEEEEEEEEEEE<<\/b> \nAh, maybe it isn't such a bad day after all. ® \nBOFH is the Bastard Operator From Hell.

Episode 25 \nSo I get this tape in from the courier and it's marked - \n- \"Ultra Urgent\" . Which means that The Boss is going to be in any time to see how.. \n\"How's that tape going?\" The Boss asks, trundling into the office at warp factor .0000000003 before I have a chance to nudge it off the table and into the bin. \n\"What tape?\" \n\"The Survey Data tape!\" He cries. \"Very important stuff that. We paid a survey company twenty five thousand pounds to do an electronic survey to find out what our customers really want.\" \n\"You mean like a good product at a reasonable price?\" the PFY chirps in. \n\"No, no,\" The Boss smiles condescendingly. \"We want to know what the customer REALLY wants - product colour, naming, whether to use chrome or not.\" \n\"All important stuff then,\" I comment, rolling my eyes at the PFY. \n\"Yes! So where can the tape be?\" \n\"Probably hasn't been delivered,\" I say. \n\"Well it's funny because I saw the courier on the way out,\" he cries triumphantly, producing a delivery receipt from his pocket. \"And he says you DID get one.\" \n\"Yes\" the PFY jumps in, knowing my policy on signing for things only too well \"- or rather someone named.. uh.. John Major did. Does HE work here?\" \n\"The beancounters maybe?\" I suggest helpfully. \n\"It doesn't matter,\" The Boss cries yet again, with a hint of triumph in his voice, while producing another tape. \"I got a copy delivered just in case!\" \nHe hands itover, chomping at the bit to get the tape read-in. \n\"Chop! Chop!\" he cries. \"What's on it?\" \n\"Well, as I've only just got the thing, it's hard to say,\" I respond, not appreciating The Boss's attempts to grease the gears of media reading. \n\"Well it's really important!\" The Boss burbles, stating once more, for the benefit of the COMPLETELY bloody stupid, the reason for his visit. \n\"Yes, yes,\" I murmur, slapping the tape into the external drive on my machine. \nNormally - I have to admit - I'd only be reading a foreign tape once I'd run it through the Virus Scanning Bulk-Eraser (Never had a Virus that's survived a good, hard, scanning from that baby). HOWEVER , if I do that it's only going to have The Boss skulking about for even longer. And I don't think I could handle it. \nOnce it's in, I run a quick tar, an od, and finally a binary dump to come to an interesting conclusion. \n\"The tape's blank,\" I tell The Boss, ignoring his disbelieving facial response. \n\"It can't be, it was written by a professional archiving company!\" \n\"Then it must have been written in Braille.\" \n\"Or marker pen!\" the PFY cries, recalling a past habit of mine of writing: \"The Boss is a Winker\" on the leader of 9 track tapes, to give the tape monkey something to cheer him up at backup time. \n\"Well fast forward the tape along a bit, maybe the data starts further on..\" The Boss cries, getting a little disconcerted. \"Perhaps they didn't rewind it properly before they wrote it.\" \n\"Can't happen,\" I respond. \"All tapes have a beginning of tape mark of someform. If there's nothing after that mark, there's nothing on the tape.\" \n\"But.. But.. \" \n\"Look, I'll show you\" I cry, grabbing a recent addition from the rubbish bin and yanking it's label off before The Boss can cop a dekko, \"Here's a tape with, uh, intermittent read errors, which we chucked out.\" \nI slap the tape in the drive and run it up. \n\"Look, see, data!\" \n\"I see.\" \n\"Which starts at the beginning of the tape. All valid data. Actually, how were you going to interpret your data?\" \n\"Oh, with this program,\" The Boss burbles, pulling a floppy out of the Pandora's box that is his business suit. \nI chuck the floppy into my machine and run up the executable (without even virus checking because I like to live on the edge) and pump the data at it. \n\"Well\" I cry, \"if we used the data on THIS tape for instance, it says that... 68% of people prefer British Racing Green or Cobalt Blue, while 11% prefer reds and browns... 73% of people prefer a name that is orientated to the British and\/or American markets as opposed to Asian... 67% like chrome, although 53% of those didn't like it to be a dominating influence... uh, 67% of the respondents were in the upper quartile of income earners, and a staggering 83% say they buy our products recently.\" \n\"Well, that's believable as the survey was of our clients, and a lot of them are rather well-to-do,\" The Boss says. \n\"Remember,\" I add, applying a pin to The Boss's bubble. \"this is just a tape I pulled out of the bin. The results are just an interpretation of the binary data.\" \n\"But it's so accurate - it's almost like it WAS the survey data!\" he responds. \n\"Hmmm. And you're not suspicious?\" \n\"Suspicious? Why?\" \n\"Well if a survey confirms EVERYTHING you expected, why spend a large amount of money on a survey? I certainly wouldn't like to be the person who suggested an expensive survey like that when it comes out telling us what we already know...\" \nThe Boss is strangely quiet at this. \n\"No,\" I continue. \"What you want is a survey that breaks new ground -tells us something we don't know. Similar data, but varying by certain degrees.\" \nA 15-watt bulb suddenly illuminates in The Boss's mind. \n\"Have you got any data like the data on that tape?\" \n\"I don't know,\" I mumble, looking to the PFY for inspiration. \"What was on that tape?\" \n\"Soft Core Porn,\" the PFY cries, obviously mistaking it for one of our archive tapes. \n\"WHAT?!?\" \n\"We, uh, take copies of stuff we delete from the users' shares,\" I ad lib, \"just in case they complain, then deny having it.\" \n\"Ah. So I want to use soft core porn as the input.\" \n\"NO!\" I cry. \"Soft core didn't work, the data was totally unbelievable. You're going to have to use some DIFFERENT data. Hardcore porn is probably best\" \n\"Hardcore?!\" he says anxiously. \n\"Yes,\" the PFY adds. \"Possibly even bestiality. IF you want good data to cover your arse..\" \n. . . \nTwo days later, at The Boss's leaving drinks (after the Big Porn scandal, which was after the Big Survey scandal where The Boss presented the data that people liked the idea of Purple and Yellow-embossed Chrome product, with names like Kamakuza which would be bought en masse by low income types)... \n\"How on earth did they find out?\" The Boss cries. \n\"Well, I think the giveaway was when you attached the data file to your email and didn't change the file extension from .jpg,\" I murmur. \nSigh... \nStill, it was time for a change.... ® \nBOFH is the Bastard Operator From Hell.

{"Date":964742400000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2000\/07\/28\/","Title":"BOFH is abysmal","Link":"\/2000\/07\/28\/bofh_is_abysmal\/","Content":"My complaint about Mr. Simon, Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH) \nI feel that there are better ways in which to disseminate the following information, but this letter will have to suffice. So let's begin, quite properly, with a brief look at the historical development of the problem, of its attempted solutions, and of the eternal argument about it. This is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact. Mr. Simon Bastard Operator is terrified that there might be an absolute reality outside himself, a reality that is what it is, regardless of his wishes, theories, hopes, daydreams, or decrees. Don't be fooled: The fact of the matter is that nowhere in the Bible does it say, \"The rest of us are an inferior group of people, fit only to be enslaved, beaten, and butchered at the whim of our betters\" . \nTo top that off, Simon's abysmal rodomontades leave the current power structure untouched while simultaneously killing countless children through starvation and disease. Are these children his enemies? \nYou may wonder why Simon's effusions are built on a backlash fueled by anger -- in the form of resentment, spite, vengeance, envy, loss, and bitterness over declining status -- on the part of judgemental amoral dirtbags. It's simply because there are two related questions in this matter. The first is to what extent Simon has tried to seize control of the power structure. The other is whether or not no matter what else we do, our first move must be to alert everyone that Simon has neither honor nor integrity, nor even knows what those words mean. That's the first step: education. Education alone is not enough, of course. We must also seek some structure in which the cacophony introduced by Simon's prognoses might be systematized, reconciled, and made rational. \n[It's about here that we started growing a little weary, so we should tell you that this was sent to us by a reader who had used a complaint generator on the Web. Click here to create your own. Right, sorry, back with the complaint] \nHowever self-pitying the national picture already is, he and I disagree about our civic duties. I contend that we must do our utmost to improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come as expeditiously as possible. Simon, on the other hand, believes that it is his moral imperative to base racial definitions on lineage, phrenological characteristics, skin hue, and religion. If we take his refrains to their logical conclusion, we see that before long, he will promote the lie of paternalism. For heaven's sake, if you don't think that I am chagrined but resigned when I witness the indifference to the fundamentals of language that Simon displays, then you've missed the whole point of this letter. \nIt is a figment of his runaway imagination that public opinion is a reliable indicator of what's true and what isn't. It is unclear whether this is because most pundits are uncertain about the magnitude of the threat posed by his jibes, because once he accepts responsibility for the problems he's caused, the focus shifts from who is responsible to what each of us can do about it, or a combination of the two. The only weapons he has in his intellectual arsenal are book burning, brainwashing, and intimidation. That's all he has, and he knows it. The bottom line is that Mr. Simon Bastard Operator's ebullitions are incompatible with the proclivities of instrumental reason. \n[Quite right] \nSIR; please accept this roasting in the spirit with which it was not intended- for the sender is a robot, which has no intentions whatsoever. This robot, knowing nothing whatsoever of you but the firm's name, did declare: \n[My complaint about The Register \nI just want to say one thing: The passage of time will make it clear to even the more slow among us that bettering the world is apparently the last item on The Register's \"to do\" list. \nHere's a quick review: This makes me fearful that I might someday find myself in the crosshairs of The Register's craven doctrines. (To be honest, though, it wouldn't be the first time.) The only winners in The Register's games are ambulance services and funeral homes. \nAnd I can say that with a clear conscience, because The Register keeps saying that nihilism and absenteeism are identical concepts. For some reason, The Register's cronies actually believe this nonsense. \nOk, I admit that I was personally offended -- and I don't easily offend -- by the value The Register places on making me become increasingly frustrated, humiliated and angry. But life isn't fair. \nWe've all known this since the beginning of time, so why is it so compelled to complain about situations over which it has no control? In short,the choice we face as a nation is whether to run our country ourselves or let nutty arrogant urban guerrillas run it for us. ® \nHere's the link to the complaint generator again http:\/\/www-csag.cs.uiuc.edu\/individual\/pakin\/complaint \n"}

Well, I'll leave you to it!\" \nHe trundles off with the user for a cup of something which I can only hope is toxic.. \nAnd I'm left wondering what Lassie would do... would she dial the suspiciously short US 24hr freecall number? Would she ring the local \"Value Added\" (pfft) Reseller and ask what the hell's going on? Or would she just relieve herself on the cabinet and wander off? \nSo I'm relieving myself on the cabinet (with the Power OFF , of course) when the user returns to the office. .. \nSlightly shocked by the look of it. \n\"Thank goodness you're here!\" I cry, adlibbing like a daemon, \"Quick, get a fire extinguisher - I think I'm holding it at bay!!!\" \nHe rips out of the office like a madman while I escalate things a bit by kicking the tower over and jumping on it a couple of times until the lid pops off, to \"stifle any lingering flames\" . \nWhen he gets back I empty half a cylinder of dry powder into the floppy and CD openings just to make sure that it doesn't \"spontaneously re-ignite\" . \n. . . \n\"Better safe that sorry!\" I mention to my helper as I empty the other half of the cylinder into the cooling fan inlet of his machine's power supply. \n\"My system!\" he gasps. \" YEARS of work!\" \n\"Oh, don't worry about it, it's all backed up,\" I reassure him. \n\"Really?!\" \n\"Nah, couldn't be stuffed.

I can't believe my luck!\" \n\"?\" The Boss hmmms. \n\"Well *I* get to be in charge! I get to make decisions for myself! Crash the systems when I want, leak your dodgy Website browsing to the HOD, randomly disconnect network connections f..\" \nI non-maskably interrupt the PFY with a quick >SLAP!<<\/b> before he can get all the way to meglomaniacland. Still he does dribble on a bit about making the user's lives a misery in his own way, making IT Management look like the prats they are, and so forth. Another NMI brings him back to the real world.. \n\"Well, maybe I was a bit hasty in my initial estimation,\" The Boss adds nervously, thinking carefully about the devil he knows. \n\"No, no!\" I cry, realising the vast untapped fear potential stored within the PFY, \"I think you were more than justified! I'm a walking technical timebomb! I'm a menace to myself and others. I can't be trusted near equipment!

See!\" \n>CRASH<  a laptop joins the debris. \n10 minutes later every piece of kit in the place is in pieces on the floor as the Boss strives to prove that I'm not a completely malicious bastard after all, and just prone to workplace accidents like him. It's all rather fun really. \nEven more fun when security rocket up in response to the sounds of crashing on the phone call they just received in time to see the boss \"accidentally\" push his bookshelf over. \n\"Thank Goodness you're here!\" I cry, using a line that's served me well in the recent past. \"He's gone completely mad you know. A walking timebomb - a menace to himself and others! Why only this morning he directed me to urinate in a mach...\" \nThe rest is just history, like The Boss.

The PFY and I are completely against the idea until we find out that the company is in fact a modelling agency with a free lunch bar. Fashionably clad models in need of IT support need the professional services that only The PFY and I can provide... \n[Later that same day] \n\"Well here we are!\" Brian, our new subcontracted boss cries proudly,indicating a mass of machines and cables laid all over the place in a rather warm office. \n\"A pig's breakfast in other words,\" I say, gazing at the mess unfolding before me. \n\"NO!\" a furry-toothed geeky type cries from behind us. \"Every system is in top working condition - I know, I installed them all.\" \n\"If by 'installed' you mean stacked them on any free horizontal surface - yes, you have done well.

They'll be stealing names and passwords!!!\" \n\"No.. .. .nothing.. \" the PFY mumbles quietly, \" NO WAIT , there's something in a program called init and another in a program called cron!!!\" \n\"The sneaky bastards!\" I cry, figuring what the PFY's up to \"They put them in programs commonly executed by the superuser which no-one kno...\" \n\"..and in id, at, and atrm!!!\" \n\"It's worse than we thought!!!\" I cry \"What do they do, grab the password and give error messages?!?\" \n\"There's error messages in there - do you think they're using it to cover up the access\" \n\"Of course!\" the boss cries excitedly \"That's how they hide what they're doing – With Error MESSAGES!!!!! \" \n\"Uh-oh, I see there's a root process running cron now!!!\" \n\"Kill it!!\" The boss gasps \n>clickety clack<<\/p> \n\"ls has error messages in it too!!!\" the pfy cries, keeping the level of panic up to 100% \n\" DELETE IT QUICKLY BEFORE SOMEONE USES IT!!!! \" \nAnd the funny thing is, it's fairly surprising how long a system will stay up when you remove all the executables, most of the libraries, and trash a filesystem or two. \n\" THEY'VE CRASHED THE SYSTEM!!!! \" the PFY cries, even more urgently \n\" THAT MEANS THEY'VE MOVED ON TO ANOTHER SYSTEM!!! \" I cry, before the boss can see reason.... \nAnd the rest, as they say, is history. \nThe boss took it well though - fell on his sword with only the slightest wimper. \nI feel a tinge of guilt - but then realise there's plenty of Unix Admin jobs out there waiting for him.... ?reg; \nBOFH: Kit and Caboodle It's all here \nBOFH is the Bastard Operator from Hell.

First off, I suppose you want to look over the kit we have about the place.\" \n\"Hi, I'm Dave - Uh, I actually saw the computer suite during my interview - with the, uh, Head of I.T.\" \n\"The other Brian?\" respond, covering well. \"Yes, a bit confusing I suppose. Still, you'll be dealing with me from now on, after.. well, you know.\" \n\"Well actually I don..\" \n\"Yes, a bit of a tragedy, but then again, we knew it was on the cards when we found that hole in the microwave dish shielding. They tell us they've repaired it though, so I'm sure you've nothing to worry about. Anyway, I'd best show you around to give them a chance to pack up his stuff before you move in.

Actually, perhaps you could help? Just chuck all the personal stuff in a box.\" \n\"B.b.but isn't this YOUR office?\" He asks. \n\"Ah, not any more. They decided I should work down the corridor, you know, after everything. So if you could just pack up that stuff and remember to stay away from the left wall..\" \n\"Stay AWAY from the lef..\" Dave mumbles as I close the door. \n\"Doing some tidying for Brian,\" I tell the secretary as I wander past to mission control tapping my temple. \"Obsessive about it apparently..\" \nThe PFY and I have a 10-minute microwave laugh break, I outline my plan then head back for round two. \nDave's sitting in the dead center of the room, unable to decide which is left and what proximity he should have to it.. \n\"Right well, I suppose we'd better get your manager's pack from the secretary, with your business cards, signing authority and company credit card...\" \n\"Ok\" Dave accedes, happy to be leaving the danger zone. \n\"So I guess you've never ordered supplies online before..?\" \n\"Never..\" \n\"That's a piece of luck, as I'm in a position to step you through the process.\" \nTwo hours and several large Internet purchases later Dave leaves the office with a bit of a sweat on, from what he believes to be microwaves. I make sure that the secretary gets a couple of glimpses of him wearing an aluminium foil \"earthing hat\" before filling him in on some of the background of computing.. \n\"..and that's why they call it rebooting..\" I explain, pointing Dave in the direction of the stairwell and slipping him a pair of steel-caps. \"So if you could just give us a hand and sort out the 4th floor machines, I've got a fire alarm to test.\" \n\"Always willing to muck in!\" Dave cries obligingly, rising to the challenge in a shot rather than return to his office. . . \nLater that day I explain the whole sordid thing to security - How Dave - who wasn't all that stable to start with (confirmed by the secretary) had had a Shell-Shocklike flashback to a war Nam, Korea or some other disastrous war zone like Leeds and had gone on a machine-wrecking rampage through the building. \n\"I'm surprised someone like that can even GET a gun licence,\" the PFY comments, ensuring that Dave's next working day will be eventful. \nAlmost makes me wish I hadn't told him it was virus combat costume party day tomorrow.

I slip a wedge under the door before any more cable can slop out the gap while I go to find The Boss. \n\"What\" I ask him, when he's wheezed his way downstairs, \"the *HELL* , is THAT?\" \n\"That's a COMMS room!\" he blurts, topping his previous personal best effort by reading the label off the door without sticking his tongue out. \nI open a door to reveal the horror of the room within. A rat's nest of cabling, thinwire, thickwire, UTP, some stuff that could be unshielded serial, and - oh dear - what looks to be a token ring experiment... \n\"Obviously a little tidying is needed..\" The Boss admits grudgingly. \n\"A little?\" \n\"Well, not so much as to cause an outage or anything, but perhaps you could, uh, repatch them, a few at a time.\" \nA few minutes and one \"Facts of Life\" briefing later, The Boss is informed about of the infinitesimal chances of fixing this without a major outage. \n\"I see. So it would be an overnight process then?\" \n\"Overnight would be how long it would take just to get the cables out of the hardware - if we used a gangmower and an axe. Outside of that, it's anybody's guess as to what's in there and what it's connected to.\" \n\"So what do you suggest?\" \n\"Someone's going to have to go in there and fix it.\" \n\"Someone?\" \n\"Someone with networking knowledge...\" \nThe PFY starts beating a surreptitious retreat. \n\".. A bit younger and more agile than me..\" \nThe PFY accelerates somewhat.. \n\"..someone who could get lost for days without anyone knowing or caring!\" \n\"A CONTRACTOR! \" The Boss and PFY cry in unison, both happy that they don’t meet the exacting criteria.. \n\"Yes, and what better contractor than someone who KNOWS about the cabling firsthand, someone who perhaps, PUT it there in the first place,\" I cry, fingering a self-promotional label on the back of the door. \n\" THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR! \" The boss cries, enlightened. \nBINGO! \n. . . ONE DAY LATER . . \nIt's been a several of hours since the cabling contractor went in - after some bad-mouthing of 'The current IT unprofessionals' to The Boss when he thinks he's out of our earshot. Still, after he'd extorted a hefty hourly rate from the boss, he was more than happy to sign on for the job. \n\"Poor bastard,\" The PFY mumbles quietly, shaking his head, proving once and for all that he bears no grudges against people who disparage his good name. \n\"But not so poor that you didn't wedge the door shut again once he was in...\" \n\"I was worried about.. uh.. loss of.. uh.. aircooling in the riser..\" he adlibs. \n\"We don't HAVE cooling in the riser..\" \n\"Oh. Oh well.\" \n. . . \nIn the end we open the door in response to the complaints about a \"loss of Internet\" and discover that the poor sod's in a bit of a state. \n\"Which of you bastards turned off the lights?\" he cries, a bit on the hysterical side \n\"Are you sure it wasn't a breaker tripping? - it happens all the time in this building!\" The PFY suggests helpfully. \"Apparently you installed budget electrical cabling too..\" \n\"Oh yes and it just SO HAPPENED that the handle on the inside of the door is missing AND a box of thinwire connectors just HAPPENED to fall down the comms riser..\" \n\"That's where they got to!\" The PFY responds. \"I was looking for those - couldn't find them anywhere! Course, it was dark with the lights not working in the riser, so maybe I accidentally knocked them down the cable gap..\" \n\"..Then I tripped on the floor ventilation grill which wasn't secured properly!\" our contractor continues. \n\"And my, you have made a bit of a mess!\" \n\"It was a mess when I started!\" \n\"Yes, but it was a WORKING mess. In fact, that's why the company always puts penalty clauses into its standard contracts - to recover lost income, etc, in an outage situation like this. I hate to think what this must be costing you!\" \n\"But this has nothing to do with me!\" \n\"The cables pulled themselves out of the patch panels and switch gear?\" \n\"Y-No, but it wasn't my fault!\" \n\"Of course it wasn't. It wasn't like you installed all the cables in the first place, charged a hefty premium on the top by selecting the longest cable length possible, didn't document your work, didn't label any of the gear, provided no strain relief, AND cut corners on the electrical cabling spec and circuit breakers. I'm sure the court will find in your favour.\" \n\" COURT!?! \" \n\"Well, these things usually end up there after an outage of this magnitude. And the repatching's will probably take you days to complete, which'll mean even more mo..\" \n\"Well what can I do?\" \n\"Well, I s’pose you could hire a couple of contractors with intimate knowledge of the network structure to give you a hand... But then again at such short notice it's probably going to be expensive....\" \n\"I'll pay!!!\" \n\"Well, I think we can help you out. Course we'll need someone to feed all the broken fibre up from the sub-basement spool for resplicing..\" \nSo it's decided, he'll give us a hand. No sooner has he signed a large cheque than we promise to say it was a routine outage and he's installed in the sub-basement comms room with the fibre loom. \nWhile The PFY's placing the wedge and flicking the lights breaker, I'm popping up a couple of stories with five boxes of thinwire terminators. \nJust like clockwork. ® \nBOFH 2000: Kit and Caboodle That's right, the whole shebang \nBOFH is the Bastard Operator From Hell.

Look, there's gigs of it!\" \nI show him a fileshare cram packed with a couple of hundred megs of smut, and flash up a couple of images as a teaser. \n\"He's even got them categorised!\" The PFY cries. \n\"He has too!\" The Boss adds, surprised at the speed at which The PFY reached his conclusion. \n(Given that it's The PFY's porn archive we're looking at, the feelings of surprise aren't mutual, though.) \n\"Anyway, it's best we delete them to free up space on the server,\" I continue, making to drag the contents into the Recycle Bin. \n\"I DO think you should retain proof. What if there's some legitimate work stashed in their somewhere? What if they deny it and claim it wasn't there or wasn't them.\" \n\"I see what you mean. But we don't really have the space on the server, as you can see..\" \n\"Ah. True. I know, what about my machine - I've got an 18gig disk with a PIII 866!\" he cries, spurting out his machine specs (obviously a party favourite) like a machine gun, \"and 256 meg of RAM!\" \n(If only that were the case - after the great hardware robbery of last week... Patching the BIOS to report false info, however, took more time that ripping off the processor and memory, but it was time well spent...) \n\"Well, I supposed we could store it there for a while...\" , I agree \"..just in case anyone asks.\" \n.. Two days later.. \n\"The Boss is pulling some long nights,\" the PFY comments a couple of days later as we exit a pub under the influence of hops derivative and notice a dull glow exiting his blinds into the street. \n\"Yes, he's a driven man!\" I concur. \"Not everyone would 'categorise evidence' so thoroughly..\" \n\"You'd think he'd go home at night, though..\" \n\"Or at least wash and change his clothes...\" \n..

For what?\" \n\"Hi, I'm Dave, Sales Director for Large Business. I don't think we've met!\" \n[Enter Vulture #3] \nThe PFY latches onto my plan as the Sales Director goes to check out the food's going and grab a couple of Lagers and Scotch and Tonic...and another Vulture drops in from on high. \n\"Some form of competition?\" he murmurs. \n\"Yes, I think there's some sort of bonus riding on the party..\" \n#4 wanders off to get the Fan Speed specs for that floor full of machines we're thinking about buying - to make sure that their combined output isn't going to upset the climate control system in our building.

Apparently he wasn't liked much, especially by the majority of women in the place.\" \n\"You realise their sales force is decimated by the suspensions? That they're probably going to lose tens of thousands of pounds in sales?\" \n\"Yes, I suppose so.\" I admit grudgingly, waiting for the inevitable... \nBLOODY BRILLIANT! The Boss cries, breaking out a bottle of brandy hitherto hidden in the expansion slot area of his machine. \nSneaky Bastard. \n\"You can't PAY for that sort of job satisfaction!\" he continues, filling a couple of tumblers happily and sharing them about with a large portion of Christmas cheer. \n\"Some form of grudge?\" \n\"Yeah, used to work for them. Changed my Large Business sale area to Bristol, then dropped me for non-performance. Now tell me, did you order anything?\" \n\"We sort of felt obliged to get a couple of desktops after everything that happened.

We'll pursue that legally next year when they don't deliver.\" \n\"How do you know they won't deliver?\" \n\"Oh, it's practice to hold all orders of suspended staff till they can be confirmed with the client. So remember, no answering the phone now. But one thing, were you two responsible for any of the bruises on my former boss?\" \n\"Well, one or two,\" The PFY ventures. \n\"Well, he did try and sell us some refurbished P-II 300s as top line kit,\" I add. \n\"One or two, you say?\" \n\"Each.\" \n\"Excellent!

How?\" \nI can't help myself, I have to help the grief process along a little: \"Well, to put it simply, your disk spins down over the holidays, gets cold, and when you come back from your break, it's dead and gone. You know, like pets you forget to feed.\" \n\"So what should I have done?\" \n\"Fed them of course. No wonder your pets died.\" \n\"I haven't got any pets!\" he snaps, irritated. \n\"No wonder!\" The PFY adds. \n\" No, I meant what should I have done with my machine?\" \n\"Well I always leave my machine on and running - 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" \n\"I see. Well, I suppose I may do that once you've got a new disk for my machine and sorted it all out and things.\" \n\"I'm afraid you can't do that.\" \n\"Why, is it because I'm not one of you computing types?\" \n\"No, it's because you've ticked the Win ME box on the configuration options for the new drive. You'll be lucky to stay up till morning tea time.\" \n\"B-but ME's stable...\" \n\"Isn't that what they said about San Francisco?\" \n\"Well what do you suggest?\" \nI look around furtively, unable to stop myself. The PFY adds to the effect by taking the phone off the hook, closing the blinds quietly and getting in on the 'furtive looks' act as well. \n\"You want a real operating system?\" \n\"What do you mean 'real'?\" \n\"I mean so advanced it's spelt ADvanced. So advanced that the word processing package won't even try and correct the two leading capitals in ADvanced like Word does (until you're forced to beat your machine to death with your rubbish bin, that is).\" \nHe's interested now. I know it; he knows it - he just can't help himself. \n\"What's it called?\" he asks shyly, totally drawn in by the look-around-furtively game, and I just know that if I was that way inclined I could almost suggest a camping trip about now. Hook, line and sinker, in other words. It's sad really. \n\"Woah, just hold on a minute there!\" The PFY blusters, taking hold of the wheel in a manner that'd have Jeremy Clarkson reaching for his tissues (tearfully, and not for some other reason which would spoil the upholstery). \"We can't just give you this OS. I mean how do we know it's right for you?\" \n\"I... Well I suppose you don't... But what's it got that I'd want?\" \n\" WHAT'S IT GOT!?! ADvanced Graphical Interface, true multitasking - not that imitation stuff you get elsewhere! Games, Manuals - it's got the lot!\" \n\"Well, I spose I'll give it a go...\" \n\"Give it a go?\" The PFY laughs mirthlessly. \"This isn't an Operating System you have a quick bash at and just throw away! This is a life experience. Once you've tried it you'll never be the same again!\" \n\"It's true,\" I concur. \"And it comes with built-in full-licence application windowing support.\" \n\"Full-license application windowing support?\" \n\"Yes, FLAWS for short.\" \n\"Like faults,\" he chuckles. \n\"Faults?\" The PFY asks, pretending to be blind to the obvious and faking stupidity so well he could mark MCSE papers. \n\"FLAWS - faults,\" our user explains. \n\"OH!\" The PFY gasps. \"I see! I'd never have thought of that! That's really quite good!\" \nOur user bristles happily under the praise while I make a mental note to ask the PFY to give his nasal passages a good wipe with toilet paper later on... \n\"Well, you've convinced me. I shall try it! What do I have to do?\" \n\"Well, it'll cost you 20 quid for a start.\" \n\"Twenty quid!?! But it's a work machine! Work should be paying for it!\" \n\"Yes, it should ,\" I concur. \"Only they don't want to. They don't want the package getting out. So while it's one of the options on your configuration form - you have to actually pay for it.\" \n\"Well what does 20 quid get me?\" \n\"Manuals, installation media, the works. Once we've installed it on your machine, of course.\" \n\"It's not pirated is it?\" \n\"Pirated?\" The PFY sighs. \"No, not at all. Look - genuine install media.\" He holds up a large shrink-wrapped bundle of disks and documents. \n\"That does seem like good value for money!\" \n\"You betcha...\" \n\"So what do I have to do?\" \n\"Well, change your OS choice on the configuration sheet, tick the box there to say you're aware that it has FLAWS, and we'll do the rest.\" \n\"Oh, so the operating system's called...\" \n\"DON'T SAY IT!\" the PFY interjects hurriedly, then catches himself. \"If you say it, they'll all want it. And we've only got one copy left!\" \n\"Really? One copy? Could I get one for home?\" \nThe PFY and I exchange what would pass for meaningful glances in some other world where we weren't complete bastards, while our client has a brainwave. \"Actually, I've just had a thought. You could install it on my manager's machine instead - he's away till next week! That'd be a nice surprise.\" \nAt least he's half right.. \n\"Well I suppose we could,\" The PFY murmers slowly. \"But who'd pay for...\" \n\"I'll pay!\" \n\"Ok, well just give him the money and fill out another install form.\" \nTwo OS\/2 installs and one hour later... \n\"You've got to take if off my machine!\" our user begs. \"PLEASE!\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"It's terrible. It crashes all the time. You said it would change my life!\" \n\"It will. Just wait till your manager gets in next week!\" \n\"YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT OFF!\" \n\"I'd like to, but I can't. See we only deal in system recovery. Kit has to be broken before we'd do a reinstall.\" \n>CRASH!< >CRASH!< >CRASH!<<\/b> \n\"I think my machine's broken!\" \n\"Of course it is. And your boss'?\" \n>CRASH!< >CRASH!< >CRASH!<<\/b> \nI wait until the PFY gives me the thumbs up on the CCTV recording, then continue. \n\"Now the only other thing is who you're going to transfer the licences to?\" \n\"Transfer licences?\" \n\"Yes. You have to transfer your licence to someone else so the OS becomes theirs, and then we can give you a new OS for your machine. Otherwise we have to reinstall the same OS on your machine.\" \n\"But no one'll want this!!!\" \n\"That's correct. However, for a small rental fee of 20 quid we'll permit you to use our rubber panelbeating hammer which leaves almost no marks on a hard drive when you hit it repeatedly - opening up another potential customer for an operating system 'upgrade'.\" \n\"And for 30 quid,\" The PFY shouts over my shoulder, \"we'll tell you who borrowed it last night when your hard drive 'failed'.\" \nYou've got to love the support experience... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

He returns still fuming (probably because we're cutting into his lunch hour) and thrusts a bit of paper with some text scrawled on it to me. \n\"Ah, they have a content filter!\" I divine, from the words \"CONTENT FILTER BLOCKING\" amongst the text of the error message. \n\"A content filter?\" The Boss parrots. \n\"Yes, their administrator is probably concerned that one or more of the words in your mail message is offensive, and is blocking them.\" \n\"Offensive?\" \n\"Yes, it's the latest in a long line of stupid ideas to sell mail protection programs. Messages are searched for 'bad' words.\" \n\"I think it sounds like a great idea - we could really use that!\" The Boss chirps thoughtfully, envisaging the kudos he'll get from upper management types when he tells them how protected they are - \"Just think - we could protect our users from abuse.\" \n\"Yes,\" I mutter. \n\"You don't think it would work?\" \n\"Lets put it this way,\" I respond. \" HOW MANY of our users currently complain about the words people use in their email?\" \n\"Well, I've got no ide..\" \n\"Should we go through the helpdesk logs and see?\" \n\"Maybe they're offended but just don't want to say?\" \n\"We're talking about people who complained when you changed the type of biscuits they got at tea break - Serial Whiners. And still they don't complain about email content...\" \n\"Well perhaps we could just do it for upper management - words that would offend them.\" \n\"You mean words like 'accountability', 'bonuses-on-results' - that sort of thing?\" \n\"You know what I mean.\" \n\"I think you'll find that it'll affect normal email conversations - people have come to expect that certain words will get through - that they've become part of the workplace vocabulary. We're sure to get complaints if we dictate what words can and cannot be used in their correspondence, doubly so if the words have a valid use...\" \n\"In which case you can tell them that it's my new policy that the company correspondence should be cleaned up and that upper levels of management shouldn't be exposed to such abuse!\" The Boss responds - eyes on the potential PR win. \n\"I was talking about them SENDING bad words. Anyway, someone would have to come up with the words to enter into the rejection list.\" \n\"You mean we can already do it?!\" he gasps. \n\"Of course. But we've never propagated the database - too hard to think of the words.\" \n\"Well, *I* could come up with some starters!\" \n\"Okay then,\" I sigh. \"You tell me them and I'll enter them into the filter.\" \n\"Wanker,\" The Boss cries. \n\"I don't think we'd want to block that word - you'd never get email from the CEO again!\" \nIgnoring me, The Boss continues. \n\"Shit. Bastard!\" \n\"Coc..\" \nAnd so it goes. The Boss gives it his best for half an hour and takes his leave, wandering back every 10 minutes or so with additions he's thought up in the meantime. \nAnd I wait for the calls which are bound to arrive. As they do. \nThe next day however, we have bigger fish to deep fry. It would appear that The PFY's selfless pursuit of Solitaire has so rankled The Boss that a meeting has been scheduled for both of them at HR Central. \n\"High Jump Time,\" I inform The PFY \n\"They can't - I've never been warned.\" \n\"Not exactly true - I think you're forgetting those three written warnings you've had\" \n\"I've never had three written warnings!!!\" \n\"Of course you did. But I threw them in the bin - Didn't want to upset you!\" \n\"So I'm screwed?\" \n\"Almost. Though there IS this HR consultant I know, who, for a modest fee could have you back in front of the desk in no time. For a small fee.\" \n\"How small?\" \n\"Five pints.\" \n\"Done. Now what do I do?\" \n\"Deny everything.\" \n\"Is that it?\" \n\"Make that 10 pints. Want to try for 20?\" \nThe PFY's silence is all. \nSure enough, in the face of complete denial I'm called to verify one story or another. \n\"You realise what this is about?\" the HR type asks me \n\"Unprofessional conduct, I'd assume.\" \n\"Yes, now what can you tell us about what occurred yesterday.\" \n\"Well, normally I try to ignore such things - for the good of morale and all, but I did think that yesterday was a bit extreme. In fact, I've taken the liberty of bringing up the Control Room Video tape from yesterday, if that's OK.\" \n\"Well it should certainly help to clear up the matter.\" \nI slap the tape in and press play. \n\"..CKSUCKER!\" The Boss blurts, then leaves the Control Room. I fast forward to a few more of The Boss's greatest hits, finally reaching the decider \"CU..>CLICK!>\" \n\"I think we've seen enough\" the HR type says. \n\"It went on all day!\" The PFY sniffles, realising the plan \"He'd come in, call me some name, then leave. I didn't want to say anything in case it affected my jo..\" \n\"IT'S TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT!\" The Boss shouts. \"IT'S WORDS WE'RE BANNING IN OUR MAIL CONTENT FILTER!!!\" \n\"We don't have a mail content filter!\" I respond. \n\"THEN WHY ARE YOU TYPING?!\" \n\"Evidence. I kept all the names you called him on file.\" \n\"PLAY THE BEGINNING OF THE TAPE!\" The Boss cries \n\"That pretty much is the beginning of the tape. I could go and get the morning tape I suppose, although that's not really got anything on it, as he only really started during lunchtime, which we don't record..\" \n\"OH VERY BLOODY CONVENIENT!\" The Boss adds sarcastically. \n\"Yes,\" the HR Type interrupts. \"I don't think we'll be needing you or your assistant for the next part of this, so you can go now. Do you mind if we keep the tape.\" \n\"Not if we get it back inside a few days - security and all that.\" \n\"Oh, I don't think we'll need it that long...\" \n10 PINTS AND A NEW BOSS TO LOOK FORWARD TO - LIFE JUST KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER!!!! ® \nBOFH T-shirts, caps, you want them, we got them \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

Now while you're standing the beancounter's backup tapes back up, I'll draw you a quick diagram and we'll try again..\" \n. . \nTrue, playing golf in the Computer Room is a little unprofessional, verging on the irresponsible even, but the high roof, heavy soundproofing and clear lanes between machines make in an optimal place for a bit of driving practice. \nIf you can hit straight, in any case.. \nThe reason for our practice is patently obvious after one has rifled through the boss-snail mail to find the annual invite to 'Senior Data Centre Managers' Golf tournament, courtesy of some supplier or another who believes that everyone who's reached a certain station in life has the expertise to handle a stick and a couple of balls. (All true if past bosses are anything to go by, but doing it in polite company is a completely different rack of plastic-covered magazines) \nSadly, The Boss is unable to attend due to his being out of work at present, so The PFY and I have decided to stand in on his behalf and Networks and Systems Managers, respectively. \nMind you, The PFY's going to have to work on the handicap a little, and I'm not talking about his 10 word a minute typing speed. \n- 10 minutes later - \n\"It's no good, it's impossible!\" he cries, slinging the club across the room with the grace and air of a professional - which only goes to show that he IS improving. \n\"I think I know what your problem is\" I respond, taking the softly softly approach. \"You're crap. However, with a small incentive, you may find your game improves...\" \nI change the lie of the ball and The PFY's position and get back into coach mode. \n\"Now, take the club, and make a hefty drive in that direction.\" \n\"Towards the Finance Apps Middleware machine?\" \n\"Correct.

You know, I think you may be ready!\" \n[The next day, after The PFY's called in on Bereavement Leave and I've called in Sick] \n\"Ah the SMELL of the freshly clipped grass!\" The PFY burbles, recalling with a tear the life he never had, (living in the East as he does). \"The lure of the fairway!\" \n\"It's even better when you're out of the carpark!\" I counter, nudging him gently in the direction of the registration tent. \n\"Can I get you a drink sirs?\" a lovely young thing asks. \n\"Scotch and Sofa?\" The PFY asks, in a manner unbecoming a computing professional. \n\"No, no,\" I interrupt. \"We don't want to start off on the wrong foot. As official representatives of our company, we need to maintain high moral standards and a competitive edge in the holes to follow. Just three pints of lager please.\" \n\"Each!\" The PFY adds. \nA scant three pints later we're paired up with a couple of senior sales types from a large ISP venture who know about as much about computing as the Microsoft knows about adhering to standards... The PFY lines up for the drive just as one of them breaks into his spiel on the benefits of Application Service Provision.. \n. . . \nOne three pints after that we're on the second tee with another pair after an extreme slice from The PFY left our former speaker down with groin injuries. Damn shame. \n\"Ah, are you going to tee off with your putter?\" one of our opponents asks The PFY helpfully. \n\"A putter!\" he laughs, realising he may in fact be slightly overlagered. \"I thought it was a zero iron. Back in a sec!\" \nHe stumbles off in the direction of a large bush while I pop to his golf bag to retrieve a 2 iron for the shot. It's quite sad to see one so young make a complete arse of himself - and even sadder when someone my ages does as well, I reflect, as I find I'm relieving myself into his golf bag. \nStill, it's all part of the game - and what a game it is. By the fifth hole, The PFY's given up all pretence of hiding the fact that he kicks our opponents balls into the rough, bunker or sand trap depending on which is closest, and just puts them into his bag as an investment opportunity. By the tenth hole, he's trying to sell their balls back to them. \n\"Five quid for threeee,\" he slurs. \n\"That's preposterous!\" \n\"It is indeed!\" I say, extremely clearly, despite the 15 pints I've had thus far. \n\"Beg your pardon?\"  \"Preposterous!\" \n\"Pardon?\" \n. . . \n\" RESULT!! \" The PFY shouts, dragging himself into the office fairly late the next morning, slamming the pairs trophy on my desk. \"That's 17 pints you owe me!\" \n\"You stole it didn't you?\" I ask, knowing full well we were kicked off the course shortly after The PFY started swimming the water traps. \"When did you go back for it?\" \n\"Never did! Slapped it in my golf bag while they were helping that boring bloke on the first hole!\" \n! \n\"There wasn't any... uh... Champagne... in it, was there?\" \n\"Yeah, awful stuff.

The recognition system makes the controlling processor aware of persons entering the work area, and pauses operations where necessary to ensure safety.\" \n\"What sort of machines are we talking about?\" I ask. \n\"Production machinery, both small and large, automated cleaning equipment, warehouse storage systems...\" \n\"Cleaning equipment?\" the Boss asks, rising from his coma once more. \"So we could save money on cleaning staff?\" \n\"Most definitely! We have a prototype vacuuming system which sends out cleaning units as needed, day and night, depending on the zone where cleaning is required. They're all controlled by a central computer which receives video and audio feeds from the units and directs their activity away from people, animals and zones marked as 'quiet' spaces.\" \n\"So you could tell the computer not to clean near meeting rooms?\" \n\"Precisely! And send it to heavy use areas like entranceways, business frontages, etc, to maintain a consistently clean look.\" \n\"That's amazing!\" the boss burbles, obviously wanting to be seen as a new broom in more ways that one... \n\"Yes, a sweeping change!\" I blurt, not wanting to miss out on a pun. \"Unless, of course ,the units go doolally and run rampant in the building!\" \n\"All units automatically switch into standby if they detect an anomaly in the encoded signal from the controller, if they lose signal from the controller, or if a direction from the controller conflicts with sensor data on safety.\" \nI don't like it. Not one bit. And not just because I have an understanding with the cleaning staff about which confidential company documents should be going into the shredder as labeled, and which should be left in the plain brown envelope marked \"Equipment Audit - Keyboards\" in the second drawer down from the left in my desk... Redundancies like this hurt everyone! \n\"That's brilliant!\" the boss continues, failing to suppress his drool reflex. \"What about the warehouse stuff?\" \n\"Well that's state-of-the-art,\" the sales rep gushes happily. \"We have automated conveyors, storage systems, inventory recognition, scanning and reordering, plus...\" \nWe pause while he looks round carefully to give the impression of secrecy: \"...Automated forklifts!\" \n\"Like we see every year in some TV science documentary?\" I ask. \nRound about now I'm sincerely regretting not getting the PFY come to this meeting. Serves me right for trying to use the time to check the IQ of the new Boss. How was I to know that the PFY's estimate of his age divided by two was to prove strangely accurate? \n\"More advanced than that!\" the salesdroid continues. \"They're just dumb machines that navigate along painted lines, stopping for obstructions once they've hit them. Our system uses image recognition to survey the nature of the obstruction and determine it's chances of moving or being removed, work out alternative routes, alter speed and direction... blah blah blah blah...\" \n\"COMPUTER CONTROLLED CAR!\" the boss shouts overly loudly, waking me from my happy slumber. \"How does it work?\" \n\"The same was as the forklift, but on a much grander scale, and with hugely different weightings for objects, speed, allowable manoeuvres, etc.\" \n\"BUT IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE?!?\" \n\"Well...\" \n\"IS IT?!?\" he gasps. \n\"It is!\" the salesdroid simpers, dragging a large briefcase out from under the desk, opening it and extending an antenna. \"Or course we're not selling it yet, but we use it all the time - and we can equip it to almost any car.\" \n\"Could we fit it to MY CAR?!?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"What is it?\" \n\"A Volkswagen Variant.\" \n\"Perhaps not every car, but most cars.\" \n\"Oh,\" the boss sighs, disappointed. \n\"But it is installed in my car, in your parking basement. Look, I'll show you!\" \nThe Boss pulls up his chair while the salesdroid logs into his laptop and starts a control app. \n\"We're thinking of calling it virtual chauffeur,\" he blurts, \"because it's just as good as the real thing. As you see, the current position is highlighted there, and I just enter either the street address of the place I wish to go, click on the DRIVE button, and away it goes. Where shall we go?\" \n\"Round the block?\" the boss suggests \n\"No sooner said, than >clickety<. Now, just click on the video screen and it shows us a chauffeur-eye view of the windscreen!\" \n\"THAT'S AMAZING!\" \n\"As you can see, the roller door isn't high enough to allow the car through yet, so the vehicle is stopped. And now we're underway. Pause to check pedestrian, then other traffic, and we're on the road!\" \n\"IS IT SAFE?!?\" the boss gasps. \n\"Safer than houses!\" the droid assures him. \n\"How?\" \n\"It knows about the roads, pedestrians, bikes, animals, and... THERE YOU GO... road works. So now it's slowing down and waiting for the Green signal. It's also, >clickety< if we look at the map, calculating alternate routes, plus estimates of a quicker path given the known levels of traffic at this time of day.\" \n\"That's FANTASTIC!\" the boss burbles, and I have to admit, I'm starting to agree with him. \n\"Not only that, but you can program it to pick you up from an address at a certain time and take you via a completely random route to another specified address. Great for those security conscious people\/\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Sure! Tell you what, we'll get it to pick us up from lunch!\" \n\"Really?!?\" the Boss cries, clearly at the threshold between excitement and needing a change of pants. \n\"SURE!\" \n...An hour or so later... \n\"So it looks bad,\" I tell the PFY. \"All our informed sources will be down the road and we'll have to forage for restricted access articles the hard way. I'm not happy! Are you listening to me?\" \n\"Yeah, yeah,\" the PFY cries, totally absorbed in his joystick, if that's not a lewd suggestion. \"You know, the graphics on this thing are amazing! It's almost like I'm really driving down Oxford Street.\" \n\"Except you wouldn't be driving down Oxford Street,\" I correct, \"not being a passenger service vehicle...\" \n\"Yeah, but... LOOK AT THAT!!!\" he cries \"A police car in the rearview!!!\" \n\"You're not going to let them pull you over are you?\" \n\"Like Hell!

However by failing to discern between \"physical\" security and any other forms of security, the Bill has involved large sections of people that the legislation was never intended to include. \nIt seemed - especially when the CBI became involved - that when the Bill was going through the committee stage the government would simply improve the wording and solve the whole problem. But the government has actively chosen to keep the legislation as is. \nThe argument from the government side is that even though the Bill covers people that it wasn't its intention to include, it doesn't have any plans to legislate against IT folk in particular and so they shouldn't be worried. This logic withstands about three seconds worth of thought. By the same token, why not simply produce Bill for every UK citizen every time with the assurance that they will only enforce it against people they choose? A nonsense. \nThe Bill will now go to the report stage and a third reading before it becomes law. \nThe fight isn't over - the CBI feels that the legislation goes against a European directive - but it wasn't a fight, merely a consultation, before this point. \nCaspar Bowden of the government watchdog to deal with Internet matters, FIPR (Foundation for Information Policy Research), had this to say: \"The Minister says the industry is not under threat of licensing, but in the same breath says activities which are routine for many types of IT personnel are caught by the Bill, and unspecified 'further action' may be required. If there is no threat, why not amend the Bill?\" \nAnd as a worrying aside, the minister behind this Bill, Charles Clarke, is the self-same minister that was behind the widely hated RIP Act that gives police unprecedented powers to snoop on individuals. ® \nCBI to lobby against anti-IT bill SysAdmins to need a licence from Home Office? \n"}

The Bill has now gone through its final stages and the amendment was voted out by 315 to 111. \nThe government's behaviour is inexcusable and it is hard to see it as anything but spite because of the hard time the IT industry has given the Home Office in the last few years because of its misplaced legislation regarding computers and the Internet. \nThe minister behind the Bill, Charles Clarke was eerily enough also the man behind the RIP Act. He has assured IT people that the government has no intention of licensing them, but has completely failed to explain why he therefore left in a clause that did precisely that. \n\"It is our fundamental principle to ensure the Bill is targeted at those specialist providers of security services who we have indicated we want to regulate, and that we do not inadvertently catch groups that are not relevant to our policy aims,\" was the best he could come up with. \nWhaddaya make of that then? ® \nBOFHs to need a bouncer licence CBI to lobby against anti-IT bill SysAdmins to need a licence from Home Office? \n"}

So it's Symbian's coming out party. \nAnd very nice it is too. The 9210 was on show at CeBIT earlier this year, and we've played with various beta builds in the pub since then. Despite its predecessors reputation of being something of a brick, it nevertheless became a cult classic as the built in Telnet allowed sysadmins to reconfigure their routers remotely. However the 9210 looks like it can shed both of these reputations. It's much lighter than your scribe's Psion Series 5MX, and the number of (and quality of) the games and multimedia means Nokia can be confident about taking a chunk of the consumer market. The screen's lush, and after a while, the prospect of returning to carrying both a phone and PDA around with you seems absurd. \nIt isn't quite the bees knees. The 9210 isn't tri-band yet and a GSM 1900Mhz model won't appear until next year, under the moniker 2920, which excludes US users from enjoying it to the max.

Having noticed the payments application has a penchant for memory leaks which causes late delivery of contracting cheques every five weeks or so, we've decided to reboot the servers after slapping in the vendor-supplied fix. \nAnd we've just finished the backup of the existing system - not being all that trusting - when the phone rings. \nWe ignore it of course - it's 6:30am and anyone in at work at this time and not at home asleep should be taken home and put to sleep, they're that sad. \nThe phone continues to ring on and off through the installation and reboot, and finally gives up around 7:30am. \nAs luck would have it - not ours mind - the user perseveres in a more traditional manner by ringing The Boss (who should be put to sleep as a matter of course), who deals with complaints in the time-honoured manner guaranteed to add value to the whole process - he passes it directly to us. \nI walk upstairs and meet a new addition to the company, Carl, from the \"Strategic Direction Unit\" . He motions me to a shiny chrome door which opens to reveal a small gymnasium with a panoramic view of the Thames. (As opposed to the staff one, if we had one, which would be si floors lower with a view - out a grate - of the side of a row of builders' skips. ) \nState of the art equipment in virgin condition surrounds me. \n\"It's all hooked up to the box over there,\" he gestures proudly. \"You swipe yourself onto a machine, it brings up your profile, then sets the machine to the settings you use, depending on the fitness plan you choose. It's great, I can't understand why no-one has used it!!!\" \n\"MMmmm\" I agree, faking disbelief. \"And your computing problem is?\" I ask. \n\"This\" he murmurs, tapping a treadmill. \n\"And how can I help you with that?\" \n\"Well, I'd like you to fix it.\" \n\"It's a treadmill, not a computer...\" \n\"But it's got a computer in it. And it's connected to one!\" \n\"No, it's got a microprocessor in it - You may as well ask me to fix your cellphone!\" \n\"Actually, my cellphone has a reception problem too! Do you fix them?\" \n\"As a matter of fact I do. Let's have a look.\" \nHe passes the phone over and I chuck it in the bin. \n\"Right, time to use your phone insurance to get a new one.\" \n\"I.... Uh.. ... I see... Um, can you actually FIX the treadmill though?\" \n\" OF COURSE I can! Give us a hand getting it over to the window and I'll get right onto it!\" \n\"Are you proposing to throw it off the balcony?!\" \n\"Of course not!\" \n\"Good.\" \n\"No, it FELL off the balcony when you moved it to.. sweep up the place a bit\" \n\"I don't sweep! I'm an executive!\" \n\"Yes. It's funny, but I don't seem to recognise you..\" \n\"I started on Monday. And just yesterday I discovered this gym, completely unused!!!\" he responds keenly. \nWell, that'd be because of the Management fitness programme. \n\"Oh, they have a programme?\" \n\"Puleeese! Have you seen the rest of upper management?\" I ask. \"As a rule they stop for a rest between floors in the LIFT! \" \n\"Yes, I'd noticed. But as it happens, I've sent a memo to the board only yesterday asking them to sponsor gym introduction classes for management - Healthy Mind, Healthy Body - that sort of thing.\" \n\"Yes, you're right to start with the body I suppose. Thin end of the wedge..\" \nSigh. \nAfter remedying the problem (plugging the machine in and waiting for the self test), I take my leave. As \"luck\" would have it again, The Boss is waiting for me when I return. \n\"All sorted out\" he asks nervously. \n\"Yeah, machine wasn't plugged in. Going like a charm now. All hooked up\" \n\"Oh, you plugged it back in then? You wouldn't like to unplug it again would you?\" he asks, a mild trace of hysteria present in his voice. \n\"Unplug it?\" \n\"Yes, just that we're not all that keen on the exercise thing,\" he pants, puffing from the strain of even thinking about the possibility. \n\" WE'RE? \" \n\"Me and the rest of the IT Management Team. And Accounts too, I hear..\" \n\"I see. He'll just plug it back in tho..\" \n\"Perhaps you could.. ah.. break.. it?\" \n\"I'm sensing some corporate disloyalty here,\" I say, in a shocked and disappointed way. \"If I didn't know better I'd think you didn't have the company's best interests at heart!\" \n\"Of course we do. What would it take to prove that this is a bad thing for the company?\" \n\"Fifty Quid should convince me..\" \n\"Each..\" The PFY adds. \n\"Manager..\" I add, really getting into the swing of things and realising that none of them wants to be the one to wimp out... \n\" YOU WANT 50 QUID EACH, PER MANAGER!!! \" \n\"No, you're probably right, having senior representation in next year's London Marathon is important..\" \n\"I'll make some calls.\" \nTwo hours and two thick brown envelopes later, the requested \"repairs\" are made. \nAnd you're sure I won't have to actually \nUSE \nthe equipment? The Boss gasps, wheezing from the effort of trying on his ill-fitting new workout gear which shows so much crack it's probably got a street value.. \n\"Nope, all you have to do is show up...\" \nThe next day I'm called up early (again) to look at the exercise machines. \n\"Well,\" I respond, to the investigating officers questions while looking at the fitness computer, \"it seems the treadmill was executing a standard running profile of nine kilometres an hour then changed to a sprint profile, of 50 kilometres an hour for some reason, hurling him out the window and into the builder's skip, into which I'd previously dumped all our old computing boxes - which was VERY lucky.\" \n\"Lucky?\" the officer asks. \"He broke both arms, an ankle and has a minor concussion!!\" \n\"Nothing too serious then,\" The Boss comments. \nThe rest is history. With an excuse to mistrust the equipmen,t the Management team is out of there like a shot, leaving The PFY and me to clean up. A couple of words of advice to The PFY are sure to help. \n\"Ok, the exercycles were ok, but the treadmills' much heavier, so we're going to have to get a runup if we're to get it in the skip - I mean out of the way for sweeping..\" ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

Another one of his PDP-11 mates has gone to the great archive in the sky.\" \n\"Heart Attack?\" The PFY asks, naming the number one killer of IT managers. \n\"Yep, Apparently the old ticker gave out when he overexerted himself.\" \n\"Refilling the paper tray on the printer?\" The PFY asks, trying to find an explanation for our Boss's inability to perform such a simple task (outside of the obvious - he's a lazy bastard). \n\"No, even more exertion than that!\" I respond. \n\"Internet Porn Marathon?!\" \n\"More still...\" \n\"Not...\" \n\"Yes!\" \n\"He used the stairwell!!!\" \n\"Indeed. They found him between the Management and Lunchroom floors after about a week of looking. If there hadn't been a fire drill he may not have been found for months!\" \n\"That's terrible!\" \n\"Indeed it is! The Boss is going to be a right pain!\" \n\"What?\" \n\"He's got the phobia. He's going to be annoying!\" \nMORE annoying, I think you mean. But what phobia? \n\"Well he's realised he's in the danger zone - again. He'll get worried, concerned, then set his mind to the task and try and get healthier in any way possible.\" \n\"Taking vitamins?\" \n\"Yes. But not just that. He'll start walking at lunchtimes, eating vegetables and low fat foods, etc.\" \n\"It doesn't really sound so bad,\" The PFY interrupts. \n\"That bit isn't. But then he'll stop coming to the pub on Friday evenings..\" \n\"No more shouts?!!!\" \n\"That is but the tip of the iceberg. Think instead - no subliminal messaging..\" \n\"Wha?\" \n\"The hypnosis tracks we recorded 6 minutes into his Wet!Wet!Wet! Cassette for his tube ride home.\" \n\"?\" \n\"The ones about him being attracted to blondes with big bazookies...\" \n\"?!\" \n\"When you wanted to get some Internet porn but didn't want to waste the time browsing for it yourself and thought you'd get them off his web cache.\" \n\" OH YES , I remember now. But it's not like NEED more piccies!\" \n\"Again, Iceberg tip stuff. If he's healthier, he'll start coming in earlier. He might even go on tours of the building as exercise, claiming he needs to 'keep in touch'. Before we know what's happening, he'll start visiting clients - and you know that'll just lead to trouble.\" \n\"How do you think so many moves ahead?\" \n\"Seen it before. It's always the same. A mate pops his clogs and the next thing you know it's change-your-life New-Year's-resolution-mid-year time.\" \n\"Yuhuh..\" The PFY scoffs, doubtfully. \n\"Just check out this early morning brew for me will you?\" I ask - directing The PFY to the coffee machine. \n\"I can't believe it!\" The PFY snorts. \"He put artificial sweetener in his tea instead of his normal three lumps of sugar.\" \n\"Artificial Sweetener?\" I Conan Doyle, \"Told you so. But now for a real test.\" \nThe real test is a sneaky one. I leave a couple of unattended chocolate eclairs on a desk outside his room, but as bad luck would have it, his Health Resolution has cut in early and he ignores them in favour of getting to know some people downstairs under the auspices of client liaison.. \n\"This is serious!\" The PFY blurts, looking at the To-do list The Boss dragged back up the stairs with him. He wants us to go out and 'hold the client's hands' while they check their backup software is working. For 'client confidence'... \n\"Just wait till morning tea.\" \nMorning tea rolls around, and some selfish bastard has eaten the two eclairs, which, I might add, were very tasty. The PFY and try and tempt The Boss with choccy biccies, but he's got immunity from them with couple of slices of unadulterated wholemeal bread as his afternoon repast. The sick bastard. \n\"Someone's got to do something!!!\" The PFY gasps, on the verge of panic \"He's talking about chairing a client liaison MEETING , Today at 4pm.\" \n\" IN PUB TIME! \" I shout. \" OVER MY DEAD BODY! \" \n\"Just the steamed vegetables for me I think,\" The Boss sighs quietly \n\"Not having any of the Onion Bhajis then?\" The PFY blurts, ladling a pile of them onto his plate, according to plan. \n\"No, not today.\" \n\"And a good idea too\" , I add, slapping a dozen or so onto my plate, \"Not the best thing to be eating - full of cholesterol! I just wish I had your willpower, but no. I just see them there, think of the juicy spice of them and can't help myself. That lovely flavour! I wish I could - but I can't. Oh, and look, Butter Chicken on the menu too - I really respect you for that!\" \nI ladle myself out a more than generous portion of the aforementioned dish, letting the sauce ooze all over the Bhajis... \nThe Boss's mask of indifference weakens slightly, but he doesn't crack, bless him. Mentally, however, I'm recalling that scene in Das Boot where the submarine is waaaaaaaay out of its depth and the hull's starting to crack.. \n..just 10 more metres... \nLeading himself not into temptation, The Boss makes a break for the healthy beancounter (and beaneater) section of the lunchroom, leaving us to our just (and cream filled) desserts. I trot on over with The PFY in tow and pop down beside him. \nThe meals of the guys around us are disgusting - all greens, no carbos, no fats. All that's taken care of in the diet supplement they get at the Gym. Even The Boss's meal looks like decadence. \n\"How's it going lads?\" I blurt, chumming up to the muscle boys of numbers. \"I say, is that a WHOLE lettuce leaf??!!! Those hormone tablets must be playing up if you're eating for TWO!! \" \nThe silence is deafening, although in the background I can hear the tiniest of high-pitched whines from what I assume is a cattle prod under The PFY's lunchtray... And then... \n\"Did you want something?\" one of them asks. \n\"No, no, just some advice. You blokes certainly know how to look after yourselves?\" \n\"Compared to some,\" another legumecounter sneers, looking down at my curryfest. \n\"Yes, yes. But anyway is it true what I hear about all those artificial sweeteners being linked with the big C?\" \nThe Boss' expression changes slightly, and I wonder if I've lost a small piece of my humanity for being so cruel. \n\"Coreldraw?\" The PFY asks. \n\"No, Cancer\" I explain politely. \n\"Oh yes,\" one of them cries, jumping on what must be his personal hobby horse (there's always one) and taking it for a gallop. \"You may as well eat WEEDKILLER as artificial sweeteners! It's so carcinogenic that a recent... OHMIGOODNESS, HE'S FAINTED! \" \nAll eyes turn to The Boss, who's face down in my meal, splashing butter chicken sauce all over my new Adminspotting t-shirt. \n\"Fainting people don't chew,\" The PFY notes. \nThe Boss takes a break from my meal to come up for air. \n\"You're a mess!\" I observe, \"And in no fit state for that client liaison meeting this afternoon. Should I reschedule the meeting for tomorrow morning?\" \n\"F--- em!\" The Boss murmurs. \n\"Welcome back sir,\" The PFY says, extending his hand. \nAnd they all lived happily ever after. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

But I'll sell it to you for 10 quid!\" \n\"And a packet of crisps,\" The PFY cries hungrily. \"Salt and Vinegar!\" \nA quick clickety-scrabble is enough to convince him that the file in question is no longer where he left it. \n\"You've deleted it?\" \n\"Have you got a backup?\" I ask. \n\"I don't trust Backups. The Operators just read through your stuff. They've done it before!\" \n\"Indeed they have,\" The PFY responds, conferencing himself in on the call. \"They do all sorts of things. Remember that time you tried to get off that parking ticket by sending email to the council parking authority? Only the message mysteriously got changed to a picture of two baboons having sex with the message 'Parking Police are inbreds' on it.\" \n\"They followed me for weeks after that,\" he sniffles. \"They painted yellow lines on the road under my car after it was parked then towed it away - three times.'\" \n\"Those operators really are BASTARDS aren't they?\" The PFY murmurs, suppressing a giggle and digging a nice, big hole. \n\"Yes they are!\" \n\"Was that before or after you complained about their reluctance to clean the dust out of your machine because you'd read it was a fire hazard.\" \n\"I..\" \n\"Or was that just after the time you reported them for piracy for running a game on two machines?\" \n\"It WAS pirated! And they were playing it in work time! And they wouldn't help me with my problem.\" \n\"That was the problem about glare on your screen when you moved you monitor, wasn't it?\" \n\"Yes, but how did you kno... oh...\" \n\"Yes\" , The PFY says in response to the unspoken revelation. \n\"And now you've deleted a year's worth of my work!\" he sniffles. \n\"No, no, we're just keeping it safe. Like we do with all Company data. We're professionals! So we'll look after it till the company has no need for it any more, then...\" \n\" You mustn't touch it! - It's the final revision!!! I'm mailing it to the publishers this afternoon!\" he gasps. \n\"If you're mailing it, why on earth would you need to secure it?\" The PFY asks. \n\"Because I have to go to the mail centre and get some stamps!\" \n\"Not in company time surely?!\" I ask, feigning company loyalty like a trooper. \n\"Of course not,\" he pinnochios. \"I was going to wait till lunchtime\" \n\"We can but hope the company needs your data till then, but...\" The PFY adds. \n\"I'll just get the crisps!!!\" our user cries as the receiver clatters home. \n. . . \n\"It's not much cop\" The PFY says, scrolling through the text. \"It needs something...\" \n\"An extra chapter perhaps?\" \n\"With furry woodland creatures?\" The PFY asks evilly. \n\"Why not! And I'll concentrate on extending the overall vocab to include words like 'knob', 'love-truncheon', 'blue-veined junket pumper,' and the like!\" \n\"By the time we're finished it'll be top of the best-seller list at the Amsterdam Fetish Festival!!!\" The PFY chortles. \n\"Good point - must give Piet a quick call!!!\" \nIt's true what they say - You have to MAKE your dreams come true... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

The matter of some concern is in fact a matter of some concern! \n\"It's his Resume, Ron,\" the HR Droid says, indicating a stack of fiction worthy of the Bard himself. \"As a matter of policy we perform background checks on all contractors who join the company.\" \nThat's news to me, but given the recent history of the non-recoverability of some files of the HR Droid concerned, I'm sure he made a special effort on my part. \nWhich was good of him. \n\"Ah... Yes - but that was a fair amount of time ago now...\" I respond. \n\"Quite. Only we were unable to verify many of your details because the referees you mentioned were unavailable - being out of the country in tax exile, in a coma, or deceased.\" \n\"Ah Yes, poor old Richard Nixon - or Dick as we called him. A good man despite everything you know.\" \n\"Nyes...\" The HR droid comments doubtfully. \"However, as it happens the personnel officer of the large international computing company you mentioned in your resume'made an amazing recovery the other day, so we were able to verify your claims to being the chief behind-the-scenes advisor in their major product lines..\" \n\"Good, that's a relief.\" \n\"He says he's never heard of you!\" \n\"Really? Well, head trauma is a funny one - one moment you're with it, the next you can't remember your own...\" \n\"Neither do any of his staff.\" \n\"Well it WAS quite hush-hush. Still, I'm a little hurt he's forgotten me. Maybe that's why I never got those royalties payments? Still, forgive and forget, that's what I say!\" I respond magnanimously. \n\"Yes, speaking of ROYAL ties, this lack of character witnesses does cast a little doubt on some of the other claims in your Resume,\" the HR drone snivels. \n\"Like what for instance?\" I ask, Perry Masoning away. \n\"Your Knighthood?\" \n\"You've got a KNIGHTHOOD?!? \" The Boss gasps disbelievingly \n\"Of course.\" \n\"I've looked - he's lying\" , the HR Drone blurts unkindly. \n\"Really? You checked on www.bofhknighthood.com?\" I respond, not to be put off. \n\"bofhknighthood dot com?\" The Boss asks. \n\"Yes, home of the bastard knighthood!\" \n\"Bastard knighthoods don't count!\" the HR geek snaps, not a happy man. \n\"Of course they do!\" The PFY cries, entering the office from his loiter-holding pattern outside. \"I'm Sir Steven of the Daisy Wheel Printer!\" \n\"This is ridiculous!\" \n\"No it's not!\" I cry, not wanting to be negative, but being forced into it. \n\"It is - there's no societial precedent!\" \n\"There is now!\" \n\"There's no ceremony!\" \n\"Yes there is! I was knighted with the silver ball peen hammer in front of an audience of my peers!\" The PFY adds. \n\"Peers?\" \n\"Of The Kerberos Realm!\" \n\"It's ridiculous!\" the HR bloke shouts, not liking this tangent one little bit. \"Steven's obviously in cahoots with him!\" \nSIR Steven, I correct. \n\"So what's your knighthood then?\" The Boss asks, muddying the water a little by humouring me. \n\"I'm actually a Knight of the ergonomic table - It's like the round table, only more comfortable to sit at.\" \n\"I see. And you went to a ceremony?\" \n\"I was unable to attend - due to work commitments. So they posted notification to me.\" \n\"I see. And what authority confers these titles?\" \n\"That would be the King of Bastards.\" \n\"You, perhaps?\" The Boss enquires drily.. \n\"As it happens, Yes!\" \n\"Right! Well, I don't really see that this is worth pursuing,\" The Boss comments decisively as he trundles out of the office. \n. . . \n\"You still can't do that!\" The HR type snivels seconds later. \n\"Of course I can! I'm the King!\" \n\"I'm afraid we don't accept your credentials,\" The HR type interjects. \"Which, as you lied in your application, puts your position at risk.\" \n\"Isn't that HIGH TREASON!? \" The PFY asks, having waited for this moment for over a minute. \n\"No no, High Treason is only during a state of War.\" I say, motioning The PFY to put the hammer down. \"This is just normal treason..\" \n\"Ah!\" \n\"But this helpful HR chappy has a point! It might be construed that the information in my application might be misleading. And as such I feel compelled to submit my resignation to my employer. . . . .\" \n. . . \n\"And?\" the HR Droid asks after 10 seconds of silence. \n\"Well I did, and he didn't accept it.\" \n\"He?\" \n\"Yes, me. As Director of the private company that contracts to you. I feel my employee should possibly have clarified his credentials further, and am disappointed in his actions. Obviously, I will be docking his pay to teach him a lesson. I may even award myself a bonus in my Director's fees for my quick and professional manner in which I resolved the situation. A professionalism which will of course be reflected in the hourly rate I will be requiring next contract renegotiation time. Which just leaves the matter of Treason...\" \n. .One Hour Later... \n\"Obviously we don't want to make a big production out of it,\" the Boss burbles to the head of HR sadly, indicating the PFY's swollen cheek. \"But when it comes to common assault..\" \n\"Indeed\" the Director of HR agrees. \"And he just hit him? No provocation?\" \n\"None\" the PFY, Boss and I respond in unison. \n\"Well, I suppose I'll have to have a word with him. And you don't want to pursue this... legally?\" \n\"Well, I think it's only the Company that would suffer,\" The PFY replies. \n\"Yes, I suppose you're right.\" he sighs, \"Very well.\" \n. . . \n\"I have to admit that I didn't think Ron would go for it - just to save a quid or so on your hourly rate.\" the PFY comments, as we break for the CCTV monitor to watch the \"firing squad\" first hand. \n\" Sir Ron, I think you mean.\" \n\"Ah,\" The PFY blurts (penny dropping) \"of the....?\" \n\"..of the OS2 install media.\" \n\"An appropriately weighty title indeed.. \" \n\"Yes, I thought so.\" ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

Yes, I like it!\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well it's simple. Remember that time stores wanted to move all those archived documents offsite to get some of their space back?\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"And they got that Document storage company in to pack it all up and store it in 'standard' boxfiles?\" \n\"And index EVERYTHING so all someone had to do was ring them and tell them the document name and they'd deliver it?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And we paid them a fat wedge of money to do it, plus recall fees, etc?\" \n\"Uh-Huh.\" \n\"And remember when our company had a huge falling out with their company?\" \n\"When you set fire to their premises, yes.\" \n\"When I tested their environmental monitoring systems to ensure that our documents were safe from fire, yes.\" \n\"Whatever..\" The Boss adds doubtfully. \n\"And remember, we ended up demanding all our documents back?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And they came back, each in its own brown envelope - with a cryptic number on it, taking up over twice the space as originally. Then we had to employ that student to sit in the basement and extract them and file them all again..\" \n\"Last I heard he was still down there,\" the head of IT comments. \n\"So you're saying that this software is the same as that document storage company, and that they're trying to disguise it by saying it's open and offering all-expenses-paid trips to the US for 'training'???\" \n***JUNKET ALERT!!!*** \n\"No, I'm saying we can learn from our mistakes!\" I blurt quickly, before The PFY can put his foot in it. \n\"So there IS something in the Content Management Server?\" The Boss gasps. \n\"There may very well be...\" The PFY inserts, catching on at last. \n. . . THREE LAGER-FILLED HOLIDAYS IN THE US LATER . . . \n\"So how's the Content Management going?\" The Boss asks, trying to peek over The PFY's shoulder at the categorisation process. \n\"Good, but a few teething problems with which categories to choose from..\" \n\"Really, can I help? I've been looking at one of those documents you bought back, and I think I've got the hang of it. Financial Documents can be categorised under department, supplier, purchase type, purchaser, purchase category, project, monetary expenditure, assets, physical location, intention, name..\" \nThe Boss burbles on for a while and then wanders off excitedly to put a comprehensive list together for our benefit. The PFY, meantime, continues with his work with the devotion of a professional. \n\"IT'S AMAZING!!!\" The Boss blurts, entering Mission Control with a smug expression on his face. \"I've been looking at the datastore occupancy figures, and apparently there's been a huge amount of growth in the holdings just this morning and it's saying the machine needs some extra hard drives!!! I didn't realise it would be so popular!!!\" \n\"Oh yes!\" I agree. \"And it's proving to be of most benefit to telecommuting workers, who can access their files direct from the Internet. Just look at the Internet usage figures!\" \n\"My goodness! That's amazing! But how long do you think we've got before the disks run out?\" \n\"Two, maybe three days. We're putting stuff in from older data tapes at the moment, which is why it's all going online so much faster.

Well I suppose I'll just leave it to you. Let me know if there's any problems tho.\" \n\"Sure thing!\" \n. . . \nBarely a day later, it's all over. The Boss's presentation to senior management took a major nosedive when a random choice of \"Financial\" categorised documents turned up an image from the \"Gurlz who do it for Cash\" series - as categorised by The PFY.

Bear in mind that good managers are hard to come by - the devil you know and all that. Before you know it we'll be lumbered with a new boss who actually wants to know where all the money goes BEFORE he signs the expenses forms, and one who won't be happy making cheques out to Campaign for Advanced System Hardware - or at least it's acronym - and we'll be forced to dip into our own pockets for lager tokens.\" \n\"Yes, I suppose you're right,\" The PFY grudgingly admits. \"But he's a bit.. well.. insipid.\" \n\"Insipid!\" I cry consulting my mental dictionary. \"Bland and unappetising. Mundane. In dire need of a short sharp shock perhaps?\" \n\"You mean really showing him what computing is all about?\" \n\"No no, I mean a short sharp shock. 90 volts AC or so, nothing too drastic.\" \n\"How will that help us?\" The PFY asks. \n\"Help? Oh, sorry, I was off on a tangent there. So you want some form of HELP? Well now you're asking. We could suggest he goes on a course for technical managers to upskill himself?\" \nAfter we both have a bit of a laugh I continue. \n\"It's not such a silly idea though.

No previous experience required, Good, No actual learning guaranteed - if you go by the wording - Good..\" \n\"They do give you a Certificate of Achievement!\" \n\"Yes, they stole that idea from Microsoft. Basically it means that you managed to turn up every day, didn't dribble into your machine enough to kill it or you, and kept your head down when the tutor asked questions... YES , I think that'll do nicely!\" \nA day later we've convinced The Boss to go and two days after that, he's gone. \nOne day even further on, he's back, new and improved. Well, he's back... Early reports say he's right into the technology thing, having had a great time and picked up lots of ideas. \n\"This Windows XP stuff looks rather exciting!\" he gasps, surfing into Mission Control on the technology wave. \"Did you know you can actually have movies and stuff playing on your machine?\" \n\"Like this?\" the PFY asks, firing up a recent release movie on his desktop. \n\"Yes! Is that XP?\" \n\"No, Linux. Exactly the same except you don't have to loosen your belt when you license it.\" \n\"Oh. Does it have support for Wireless as well? You know you can save a bundle on cabling by putting in wireless hubs for your machines? And it makes offices easier to re-organise in the event of a restructure!\" \nThe tangy smell of hysteria is in the air, and The Boss is exhibiting all the classic warning signs of a technological zealot. We may have to put him through the 'paperless office' test... \n\"Wireless is already installed\" the PFY responds, pointing at a heat sensor in the roof. \n\"Really? I always thought that was part of the fire alarm.\" \n\"Most people do, but see that little light on the side, it flashes once a minute to tell you the network is present.\" \n\"Really?! Well, we must put in some connections - say just the managers - then we can put our machines anywhere I like in our rooms and not have to worry about cabling ever again!\" \n\"Your machines run without power?\" I ask, putting the slipper in when he should be down. \n\"Good point. Well I suppose we can afford laptops for the managers - which would actually allow us to TAKE OUR MACHINES TO MEETINGS!!! \" he gasps again, seeing the future extend before him. \n\"Ah, I don't think we have the budget for that..\" The PFY suggests helpfully. \n\"Nonsense! There's a stack of money earmarked for an improved fileserver which we can defer till next year - or the year after if that's more pressing projects. Fileshares are a thing of the past! SAN is the answer!\" \nShort of foaming at the mouth, The Boss is pretty much proved to be in Zealot mode. Only one thing will prove it... \n\"Do you want me to print up some proposals, circulate them to the managers and then print a purchase order up....\" \n\"No More Printing!\" The Boss cries exhibiting the final - and most damning sign of a Zealot. \"WE WANT A PAPERLESS OFFICE! WE'RE IN I.T FOR PETE'S SAKE!\" \nThe PFY and I have a second's silence before implementing backup plan 107E. \n\"Actually,\" the PFY asks, \"Doesn't your machine HAVE a wireless LAN card inside it already? I think we purchased one with it!\" \n\"Really?\" The Boss gushes. \"I'll just go and see!\" \nFive seconds later the phone rings. \n\"No, no card.\" \n\"It's internal - it'll look like a blank plate.\" \n\"Uh, well, I don't know.\" \n\"Tell you what, pull your network connection out of the machine and try and check your mail....\" \n\"Nope, it says the network is unavailable.\" \n\"Unavailable........ OH I KNOW! Your machine is being earthed by the earth cable in the power cord. Shut your machine down, break off the earth pin and start it up again.\" \n[clatters and grunts removed in the name of good taste] \n\"No, nothing!\" \n\"It's ok, your machine is probably not communicating because there's no aerial, but we can use the power lead for the time being, just lift your machine up so that it's as near as you can get it to the Wireless Access Point.\" \n\"I could stand on my table. Do I need my monitor?\" \n\"Only if it's been de-earthed as well.\" \n\"I'll call you back!\" \n\"Ok, I'm standing on my table and I've put my computer on an extension lead so it's right next to the... OH! The light flashed, the network must be going.\" \n\"Yes, the network is there, but you have to remove the heat seal on the access point.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"Do you have a cigarette lighter?\" \n. . . \n\"..and it looks like we'll need a new manager,\" the Head of IT informs us. \"He's decided that once he's out of hospital he's going to take up an outside job like market gardening.\" \n\"Yes, it's probably for the best.\" \n\"So in the meantime I'd like you to look after the manager's role - until such time as we can appoint someone....\" \n® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

Just you, me, and some users who think they're playing opponents who can be killed?\" \n\"Would LIKE to,\" I comment, \"but I'm working on my last epic...\" \n\"Really. Do you need some quotes?\" he asks, cranking up his creative juices in a flash. \"What about 'A user needs the admin password like nitroglycerine needs a good shake'? No? How about 'If you can keep your head while all around you are losing theirs, you probably have a CD writer on your desktop'?\" \n\"Yeah, well it doesn't REALLY fit in with the Content of my new book,\" I mumble, trying to focus on the right word to finish the page. \n\"Which one is that?\" The PFY asks, looking over my shoulder. \"'Feel the fear and call us anyway'?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"'Men are from Mars, Users are from Uranus?'\" \n\"No, but it feels that way sometimes.\" \n\"'I'm OK, You're.. in hospital'?\" \n\"No...\" \n\"'Zen and the Art of Computer Maintenance'?\" \n\"No...\" \n\"So it's a new book you're working on then?\" \n\"Indeed. It's not my normal type of Self-Helpless guide, but something real.\" \n\"No more deep and meaningless stuff?\" \n\"Well, I didn't say that, I just said this one is going to be different.\" \n\"You're not writing a '..for Dummies' book are you?\" \n\"No, but you're very warm,\" I respond, flipping to the cover page. \n\"WINDOWS XP for RETARDS!\" The PFY reads over my shoulder. \"I like it!! Although isn't the word 'IS' missing from the title??? So anyway, what's inside?\" \n\"Oh, it's just Windows XP notes I've scabbed from various websites, slapped into a nice font with bolding and underlining here and there - with a bright coloured cover on. And - my favourite - to make up content, I'm loading XP screenshots from all over the place.\" \n\"Screenshots?\" The PFY asks disdainfully. \n\"Yes, if it wasn't for the screenshots and the large font size, the whole thing would be about 40 pages long. But WITH the screenshots and liberal font size, I'm probably looking at a 200-250 page beauty!\" \n\"They'll never buy it. No-one's that stupid!\" \n\"Don't you believe it. I'm just printing the cover now, basing the book around the idea that there must be someone out there who has problems reading even the simplest of technical docs. Someone to whom '...for Dummies' books are overly technical. Someone who's easily impressed by bright colours, pictures and the Comic Sans Serif font set. And speak of the devil...\" \nWe both pause as The Boss trundles in with an expression that can only mean one of two things - He's confused, or the laxative that The PFY slipped into his chocolate eclair is working. \n\"MMMMMmmm,\" The Boss mumbles - extending the suspense a little longer. \"Does anyone know where this came from?\" \nHe holds up the aforementioned full-colour cover, fresh from the \"Management-Only\" colour picture which is normally reserved - because of cost - to important documents like Company Reports, Pie Chart Graphing and late-night pornography. \n\"Ah, the XP for Retards book!\" I cry. \"It's printed, Excellent! I've been waiting for that!\" \n\"For 'RETARDS' ?\" The Boss asks, not too impressed with the lack of PC. \n\"I don't know,\" I respond. \"I think it's some marketing thing by the company that sells them - you know, appeal to the people who want that stuff that other books skim over.\" \n\"Yes..\" The Boss responds, getting interested now. \"So why are you printing it?\" \n\"Oh, well, it's available on the website for a discounted price because they don't have to do the shipping, packaging, printing, etc. You just download it and print it yourself - straight from their website, which means you get the latest revision!\" \n\"Now that IS a good idea\" The Boss says. \"What's the book like?\" \n\"See for yourself!\" I cry, pointing to the large stack of plagiarised data and pictures that I call my own. \n\"..Yes..\" The Boss murmurs, leafing through the document and liking the Picture to Text ratio (as expected). \"And how much did it cost?\" \n\"A hundred and eighty quid.\" \n\"A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY QUID!\" he gasps. \n\"RETAIL,\" I comment, revising The Boss's gullibility factor (sadly). \"But off the Web... 100.\" \n\"It still sounds a little steep!\" \n\"True, but they do ship you an 'Advanced Retard' CD, as well as a complimentary T-shirt.\" \n\"A free t-shirt?!\" The Boss gasps, sold. \"And how do you order?\" \n\"Well, you order it from the 'Society of Hardware and Information Technology Helpers, Executive Administration Division' website - you're a member aren't you?\" \n\"Uh, no..\" \n\"Really? Everyone says you are.\" \n\"Oh. Well maybe I am then, I don't know. I'm a member of so many things...\" \n\"Yes, well, just go there, enter your User code and Password, and they'll let you order it through their arrangement with one of the major Online Selling sites. But you'd have to do it today as it's the last day of the free t-shirt offer.\" \n\"Oh! Right! And if I've mislaid my User code details?\" The Boss asks, jiggling about in the manner of someone hearing nature on call-waiting. \n\"Well, I suppose I could order it for you. But then, no, I've maxxed my card out on the other books with the same shirt offers.\" \n\"Other books?\" The Boss blurts, needing to get away, but not wanting to miss out on the opportunity of the company paying for his clothing. \n\"Yes, there's a series of ten?\" \n\"All 100 quid each?\" \n\"Yep.\" \n\"OK!\" he gasps through clenched teeth. \"Here's my card, order them - make sure you get a receipt!\" \nThe Boss minces away at full speed after slapping his card down on the table while I fire up Amazon and start browsing the DVD section. \n. . . \n\"Ah, he'll be back soon!\" The PFY says, eyeing the corridor to Mission Control nervously while I put the finishing touches to my 1000 quid order. \n\"No he won't.\" \n\"He will! He went to the Gents at the end of the corridor!\" \n\"The Gents with the internal door handle removed?\" I ask. \n\"Ah!\" The PFY cries, enlightened. \"You bastard!\" \n\"No, no,\" I cry defensively. \"A BASTARD would have expoxy resined the cubicle doors shut last night so the poor bloke had nowhere to go...\" \n\"You're a bastard aren't you?\" The PFY asks, recognising professionalism when he sees it. \n\"In the flesh, In your face, and on my way to the T-shirt printing website.\" \n\"So you're actually going to print shirts.\" \n\"Who would miss the opportunity of getting their Boss a T-shirt with a RETARD motto on the back?\" \n\"What motto?\" \n\"Well that's where you come in. I need ten, ASAP.\" \n\"Ok. What about 'RETARD' with an arrow pointing up?; 'RETARD' just by itself; 'RETARD AND PROUD OF IT' ?....\" \nand so it goes.... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.

We advertise our stuff with the opposition's site address, and then we get all their customers because all their people will come to our site!!!\" \n\"They'll come to OUR site?\" \n\"Yes! It's this idea a guy in marketing had. If we use their name, but tell our web server to talk to anyone who wants to get to their website - we'll get all their customers!!!\" \nThe savouring process begins. \n\"So let me get this straight - We use their website address and get all their customers to our website?\" \n\"By telling our server to pretend to be their server, yes.\" \n\"And this would work how?\" \n\"The same way it did when you told our server to pretend to be the 'www' and 'jobs' servers. You know, virtual site, or whatever.\" \n\"Ah, Of course. But wait! I've got a better idea - Why don't we pretend to be Microsoft.com - and then we'd get all their web traffic - and that's bound to be a stack more than we'd normally get! And then, when people automatically go for one of those patches to make Windows less secure, we can advertise to them!\" \n\"Do you think it would work?!\" The Boss gasps. \n\"As well as the first plan!\" I respond. \nBefore I get a chance put the slipper in repeatedly, he's off to assemble the Marketing Crew to tell them of his latest plan. \nThe PFY gives me a withering look which can only mean he thinks I'm digging a hole to fall into.. \nHalf an hour later I'm starting to think that maybe he's right. The Boss is back with a huge list of dotcoms that the Marketing Dept has come up with that we could use to further our products. \n\"Cisco.com - very good, Yahoo and Hotmail - excellent, yes, it looks like you've got a good list here. You realise that they're likely to complain..\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Oh yes. And then it's legal problems - us having nothing to do with that industry - no end of hassles. Same for government sites.\" \n\"Oh,\" The Boss burbles sadly, no doubt wondering how he can break the bad news. \n\"Although I suppose you could use all the sites that get a stack of traffic, but have a less than happy existence with the legal system.\" \n\"But you said that we can't use Microsoft.\" \n\"No, I was thinking Porn sites.\" \n\"Porn sites?\" \n\"Yes, Porn Sites. They get a stack of traffic and have a less-than-happy existence with legal authorities.\" \n\"Do they get that much traffic?\" \n\"Well from our site alone the porn industry gets more hits than our website gets from the rest of the world.\" \n\"Really.\" \n\"Yes! I can show you the logs if you like! You'd be surprised who's looking at wha..\" \n\"That won't be necessary,\" The Boss chips in guiltily. \"So which sites should we use?\" \n\"The popular ones, obviously.\" \n\"And they are?\" \n\"Oh I don't know, I'd have to go and look to see which have a lot of content.\" \n\"How long would it take?\" \n\"Oh, hardly any time at all - two, maybe three days.\" \n\"I've got installations to do!\" The PFY blurts, not succeeding in masking his annoyance. \n\"I think that the installations could wait a while,\" The Boss responds. 10 minutes later.. \n\"THREE DAYS OFF TO BROWSE PORN!\" the PFY cries. \"I LOVE MY JOB!\" \n\"I think you're missing the point,\" I respond. \"We're trying to find sites that would be used to promote the company, which means that you'll be grading sites on the following criteria: The number of visitors; Originality and breadth of content; Specialist Content and quantity of content. Once you've rated the sites on these scales you would TELL ME ABOUT IT TOO BECAUSE I LOVE MY JOB AS WELL!!!! \" \n..Three days later... \n\"..And unfortunately, it transpires that you can't pretend to be a site which is already set up, as the DNS won't direct enquiries to your machine simply because you pretend to be that site!\" \n\"This is terrible!\" The Boss blurts. \"So we can't even use our opposition's site name after we printed all that promotional material?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"So the whole thing's been a complete waste of time.\" \n\"Pretty much.

What sort of equipment precisely?\" \n\"A vaxcluster,\" he burbles excitedly. \n\"A VAX Cluster?\" I ask, suppressing a shudder. \n\"Yes, but not just any ordinary vaxcluster - it's a beowoulf cluster.\" \n\"A Vax Beowoulf cluster,\" I repeat, pausing momentarily to try and think of a sadder life form - coming up blank. \n\"Yes, I've got three Alphas, Two 11\/780s, a 11\/730 and four microvaxes.\" \n\"Yes, wel..\" \n\"And I'm rebuilding an 8530 which I got from a company that was going to SCRAP it!\" \n\"Shocking!\" I concur, humouring him - figuring that anyone who would rebuild an 8530 in their own time is someone who needs gentle handling.. (and possibly locking up for a long, long time). \"Although, TECHNICALLY the Alphas aren't actually VAXes, are they?\" \n\"No!\" he blurts, incorrectly identifying me as a fellow Digital geek. \" HOWEVER , they're early Alphas, which were the most backwardly compatible.\" \n\"I think you'll find that most of that gear is fairly backward,\" I murmur. \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"I said I think you'll find that you're going to need fairly hefty fireproofing. What sort of room are they in?\" I ask, mentally picturing the hottest, noisiest, most cramped double bedsit in the world. \nWell it's a perk of a part-time job I have looking after a standby datacentre - they let me run some of my machines there in return for me keeping an eye on the place. \nRight, I see. So there's no space problems. And given the machine's age, I assume you're worrying about thermal shock? \n\"Exactly!\" \n\"Is the cluster doing anything important?\" \n\"Well it's been calculating Pi to a new record of decimal places for almost a year now.\" \n\"So you don't want to take it down to install the fire protection?\" \nOur conversation is interrupted by the arrival of The PFY, so I get the Helldesk geek back over with a quick wave and ask him to explain his dilemma, telling him The PFY is the brains behind our infrastructure protection systems. \nAs the problem unfolds The PFY's eyes light up in anticipation. \n\"I suggest you use a liquid extinguisher, stored at room temperature,\" The PFY comments as turns from the bar with a drink for me and the Helldesk geek. \n\"Not gas?\" \n\"No - Gas systems introduce thermal shock from their expansion - law of thermodynamics. Besides, they're hellishly expensive. However, a liquid coolant\/extinguisher doesn't expand, and so can be kept at the same temperature as the equipment.\" \n\"I see. And what coolant do you suggest, water?\" \n\"No, water has a problem in that it can actually act as an oxidant in very hot fires involving metals like magnesium, etc, some of which are used in computing.\" \n\"So what coolant?\" \n\"Well, recent thinking seems to centre around a semi-viscous liquid like an oil.\" \n\"An OIL?! \" \n\"Yes - because oil has a very low heating coefficient.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"It takes ages to get oils to change temperatures, which makes them ideal for extinguishers.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Of course! Think about it. How long does it take to boil a jug?\" \n\"About five minutes.\" \n\"And how long does it take your chippy to warm up their vat?\" \n\"I don't know.\" \n\"Well it takes about one and a half hours - see my point?\" \n\"No?\" \n\"It takes a lot longer to heat vat oil up than the water in your jug. And you know why?\" \n\"Because the vat's about 100 times the size of my jug?\" \n\"NO, because oil has a lower heating coefficient!\" \n\"Oh, I see. So what oil is commonly used?\" \n\"Generally, Industrial Diesel.\" \n\" DIESEL OIL!?!! But that's flammable!!\" the geek cries. \n\"Only under very particular circumstances,\" The PFY responds calmly, plying the geek with yet another drink, \"generally very high pressure as well as extreme heat. Neither of which you'll get in a computing environment.\" \n\"I don't understand,\" the geek responds, dubiously. \n\"Do you know how a diesel engine works?\" \n\"Like a car engine?\" \n\"Not at all! Diesel has such a low octane that the engine actually has to pressurise the stuff to make it ignite. AND the engine has to have heat from a glow plug to actually get the pressurised stuff to burn!\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Of course. hy do you think most of the world's cars run on petrol?\" \n\"And it won't catch fire in computers?\" \n\"It hasn't in ours, and we've been using it for over a year now.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Of course, what do you think those drums of diesel in the store are for?\" \n\"The generator?\" \n\"Goodness no! You wouldn't run a generator on Industrial diesel! It's crap. You'd be better running it on petrol like we do\" \n\"You run your diesel generator on petrol?\" \n\"Uhuh, and we use the diesel for our fire extinguishers. In fact, I could probably give you a barrel as we only keep it in case of a leak in the system.\" \n\"I don't think I need it - we have a generator in the datacenter which I could refill with petrol, and use the diesel of!\" \n\"Right! Where is this datacentre?\" \n\"It's a couple of blocks away, in the basement of that large insurance building.\" \n\"An Insurance building\" The PFY mouths thoughtfully. \"Tell you what - why don't you shoot there and set it all up and we could help you commission it once we've had our dinner!\" \n\"Ok!\" The geek chirps, slipping off quickly. \n\"Couple more pints before we head over?\" The PFY asks. \n\"Yeah, I spose I could fit them in.

It's the same thing every year - we're obliged to attend an Occupational Health and Safety Course and identify risks in our environment that need to be addressed. Failure to attend means you're marked 'absent from school' and get docked a day's pay, thanks to the stooley nature of the HR Droid concerned. The rows of vacant faces are a testament to how well this works after the low attendance last year... \n\"Obviously, this is good for both you and the company,\" The Droid continues, \"because we reduce the incidence of accidents to you and lost revenue to the company!\" \n\"Didn't we already do this?\" The PFY murmurs quietly, remembering something similar from days past. \n\"Yes,\" I respond. But it hasn't escaped the attention of the HR department that whilst accident reports for us two remain at a static ZERO , accidents in our area just keep increasing. \n\"Oh. So you mean they wanted us to identify areas which put OTHER people at risk?!?\" \n\"I believe that was the purpose, yes.\" \n\"Ah! Now I get it! I did think they were paying a lot more attention to our wellbeing than they normally did.\" \n\"Indeed.\" \n\"DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE?\" the HR Feeb snaps in a distinctly annoyed manner. \n\"Well, yes,\" The PFY replies. \"This identifying danger areas - would this be like the Danger of getting shut in a tape safe over the weekend?\" \n\"Well YES , I think that would be a valid danger!\" he responds, pleasantly surprised that someone was listening for once. \"And so from that danger, or potential accident, we would work back to the cause, and ways to prevent it.\" \n\"Oh. OK, well I suppose the cause would be annoying me, and ways of preventing it would be locking my office door and taking the phone off the hook.\" \n\"No, I think you misunderstand. We're talking about ways to prevent the accident occurring - or getting worse - like perhaps fitting a safety release to the inside of the door.\" \n\"Oh,\" I interject. \"We actually used to have one of those, but it was removed to ensure that in the unlikely event of someone being trapped in the tape safe it would provide enough air to sustain life.\" \n\"You mean the safe is airtight?\" \n\"Well it HAS to be airtight to work - otherwise the heat of a fire would penetrate the safe and destroy the media.\" \n\"Ok, but thinking back a step, wouldn't the safety release remove the need for an air hole?\" \n\"Ordinarily yes,\" I concur, \"but in the UNLIKELY event that a large filing cabinet was ACCIDENTALLY leant up against the outside release mechanism, it would still provide the air needed for the person inside.\" \n\"I think you're multiplying slight probabilities here, and the likelihood of this happening as you described is extremely small.\" \n\"But still a possibility,\" The PFY responds darkly. \n\"But not one which would lead to anyone endorsing the removal of a safety feature in a device. Tell me, who removed the lever concerned?\" \n\"I did,\" The PFY responds tersely, obviously thinking back to that couple of hours of feverish activity before the torch batteries ran out... \n\"Well it's not recommended, and as an Official Safety Agent of the Company I'm required to ask you to replace it - but how would someone even get trapped in a tape safe?\" the HR Droid asks, really starting to labour the point now. \"Surely it has shelves, and tapes, in it?\" \n\"Well there's no point in putting tapes in it if they're not going to be safe from fire,\" I respond, deciding on the recursive approach, \" what with that air hole in it and all.\" \n\"But if you put the door release back, then replace the shelves, there'd be no possibility that someone would get locked in the safe!!!\" he cries triumphantly. \n\"But then there'd be no air in the safe,\" The PFY blurts, playing dumb. \n\"You don't need it!\" \n\"You do if you're trapped in it over a Bank Holiday Weekend just because you won too many games of Unreal Tournament and your Supervisor is a poor sport!\" The PFY replies. \nPerhaps I'm being oversensitive, but I may have detected a slight touch of annoyance in The PFY's voice - almost as if he still bears a grudge about the lost weekend last year. I momentarily consider advising him to just let it go, but decide to play it safe and say nothing. \n\"But you can't get lock in there if the lever and shelves are in there!\" \n\"I'm not sure I follow you,\" I say, joining the discussion.. \n\"It's simple,\" he explains, going to the whiteboard and drawing pictures frantically. \nThe rest of the audience look on silently - knowing what this means - the God of Workplace Harmony requires a sacrifice... \n\"I'm not sure I follow you either,\" one of the IT geeks speaks up, remembering only too well the reduced pay packet he encountered this time last year. \"Perhaps we should actually see it in-situ, as it were.\" \n. . . \n>SLAM!<<\/b> \n. . . \nGod of Workplace Harmony appeased, good fortune soon to follow... ® \nBOFH: The whole shebang \n"}

The silver suit was a dead giveaway, as was the keenness to sit next to someone he'd spotted arriving alone... \n\"Amazing stuff this technology isn't it?\" he whispers furtively, going for the back-entrance approach of pretending to be a fellow professional. \n\"Technology?\" I ask vacantly, playing along. \n\"Yes, V-O-I-P,\" he mouths, using one of the crappest acronymns available on the market to date. \n\"VOIP?\" I ask vacantly. \"You mean those planes that can take off like a helicopter?\" \n\"No, that's VTOL. I mean Voice Over I.P!\" \n\"IP?\" \n\"Yes, IP!\" he replies, drawing an acronymic blank and deciding to bluff. \nWell, two can play at the idiot game! \n\"Oh. That sounds a bit technical to me.

The company doesn't mind too much at the moment because they're still getting all the accounts set up, so it's pointless waiting till all that's done to buy stuff. So they just send me Bank Drafts till we're up and running. And it's small potatoes in the scheme of things - the company's loaded.\" \nBefore I know it I've been dragged out of the conference like a shot and into an environment more suited to decision-making. The snug bar of the nearest drinking establishment. \n\"For as little as, er, 50 quid per machine, we could get you some state-of-the-art.. thinwire cards and some multiport repeaters to hook them all up.\" \n\"50 quid, is that cheap?\" I ask naively whilst trying to get another pint in before he gets to his next item of computer scrap. \n\"Well you won't see many for that price these days,\" he responds. \n. . two hours and seven pints later ... \n\"Right, and what about that bundle price on that Operating System stuff. We buy 50 OS2s for 100 quid apiece, and you'll give me 20 quid trade in on my old Operating Systems.

The only concern I have is that I'm starting to like the idea, which can only mean one thing - I've had too much to drink and I need backup. \n\"Right, well, I think I'd better get my technical bloke in to give it the once over,\" I mumble. \n\"Technical bloke?\" my salesguy cries unhappily. \"I thought YOU were the technical bloke!\" \n\"Yeah, but we've got this young bloke in who installs all the stuff.\" I slur, \"Crash hot at the screwdriver work, he is.

Three hours, 8 pints, a curry, a cigar and a strip club later... \n\"Well it certainly has been a great day!\" the Salesbloke says, pulling out an order form and writing some hasty line items on it. Leaving room for an extra zero or two in the qauntity column, I note. \"How about we sign this stuff off and I'll process it tonight before I go home for you?\" \n\"Sounds great!\" I slur, leaning on The PFY for support. \"I'll give the signing guy a call.\" \n\"Signing guy? \" But I thought YOU could sign orders? \n\"Nah, he can only approve them.\" The PFY responds, having 'learnt' English at an astounding rate over the course of the night. \"But the accounting bloke has to sign orders for him. Hang on, I'll give him a call - where are we?\" \nI point out the street name and The PFY dials The Boss's home number and proceeds to do Swedish chef impressions down the line. \n\"Buludddy nice bloke,\" The PFY mumbles to us. \"But doesn't speak a word of PortugeseThingy.

But the thought of taking on some complete greenhorn, removing the brainwashing they received about user service, then retraining them in the gentle art of user discipline, just upsets me. \nAnd to top it off he knows this, and also knows that I have a couple of weeks of beach leave (i.e. User support conference in the bumhole of Leeds [insert any Leeds location here] which I have NO intention of going to, but can claim gobs of 'travel time' for...) and is trying to stuff it up. To make matters worse, he also knows I'm not a capella on this trip thanks to a heavy drinking session with the Company women's soccer team, and is using this as a way of twisting the knife. If I hadn't taught him so well I'd be really annoyed. \nStill, we can't both be away, AND that I can't phone bomb scares for two weeks continuously.

Half an hour later he's sighing audibly, so I figure it's time to help out. \n\"Anything up?\" \n\"What does 'Seasoned veteran of computing' mean?\" he asks, looking up. \n\"VMS programmer. Bound to be. The 'seasoned' bit means you need thick glasses, a beard and no clothes sense, the 'veteran' bit tells you it's VMS. If it were a Seasoned Vet of Programming, that would be different - you'd be a beardy speccy geek who knows COBOL!\" \n\"What about a Microsoft All-rounder?\" The PFY continues, ignoring me. \n\"You can use 98 and NT without dribbling...\" \n\"What about 'Proven experience in Leading Edge Systems'?\" \n\"Well, the 'Leading Edge' bit means you'd using something with a dubious future, so my guess is Macintosh Support or something involving using a 'Tablet' device\" \n\"Bastards!\" \n\"Oh yes, Situations Vacant are a real minefield.

What about 'Hands on' role.\" \n\"Sleeping with the clients again...\" \n\"Well there's just bloody NOTHING here!\" he snaps, dropping the papers on the desk. \n\"What about that one there?\" I ask, pointing out a large and colourful ad. \"Test Analyst?\" \n\"What does a test analyst do?\" \n\"Mainly try and break things - which is not too dissimilar to parts our job in some ways - except that you don't have to let yourself into The Boss's office first.\" \n\"Do you think I could do it?\" \n\"Course you could!\" \n\"So should I apply?\" \n\"Why not?

Sure, you say you're connected with the real world, but what proof have you got that you're not turning into a closet case furry tooth with full on pocket protector, thick rimmed glasses, and even worse, an autographed photo of Bill Gates by your bedside? Take this simple household test to see how you may have drifted in your thinking, and whether it's too late to save yourself and those around you... \n1. The only interview method to be universally outlawed by the Geneva Convention is: \nA. Physical Torture B. Solitary Confinement C. Forcing the Subject to drive a Trabant for a week D. Forcing the Subject to use OS2 for a day. (which feels like eternity) \n2. You're locked in a room with Richard Stallman and Bill Gates and have only a gun with two bullets in it (which you normally secrete on your person in case you ever get locked in a room with Richard Stallman, Bill Gates, etc). They both clear their throats to speak. What do you do? \nA. Shoot Bill, hoping he hasn't got a tablet device (or the XP Security Vulnerability notes) crammed up his blazer B. Shoot Richard, hoping he hasn't got the notes for his speech in front of his heart C. Shoot Richard AND Bill and take your chances D. Shoot yourself, twice, for getting into such a contrived situation \n3. You meet someone nice at the pub and immediately ask them to tell you: \nA. Their Star Sign B. Their Phone Number C. Their Name D. Their IRC Handle E. Whether they prefer RD or DDR in performance applications? \n4. Speaking of IRC Handles, your handle is based around: \nA. Your name and a number B. Your nickname and a number C. A mannerism or pastime and a number D. A physical attribute of yours that you claim is over a foot long. i.e. A leg E. D,and it's not your leg. I.e. Arm F. E, and it's not your Arm G. Nor your torso, your large or small intestine, your veins or artieries... \n5. A new machine arrives at work and is delivered to the recipients office before you can get a good look at it. You: \nA. Ignore it as you're bound to see another one sometime B. Try to catch a glimpse of it through the doorway C. Offer to help the recipient unpack it, then takeover as soon as they agree D. FAKE A SEIZURE outside the office just so they'll give you a couple of minutes alone with the box when you say you need to catch your breath. \n6. The LEAST believable thing about the movie THE NET was: \nA. That they could trace a cellphone that accurately B. That a woman could make a short phone call in the first place C. That anyone who cut themselves off from the rest of the world wouldn't have installed a dual head espresso machine beforehand D. That a techo would be using a Macintosh. \n7. Your email is going to be down for two days while the server is replaced so you: \nA. Bulkmail everyone in your entire address book warning them about it in case they choose those day to email you B. Change ISP C. Arrange for clinical sedation and hospitalisation to get you through D. Use it as an opportunity to do all those things you never have time for normally, I.e. Talk to the wife and kids, eat, wash, etc. \n8.

HA! HA! HA!\" \n9. Inside your wallet, in front of the condom that expired three years after you bought it (which in turn was three years before now), you have a picture of: \nA. Yourself, in case you ever need ID B. Your Mum and Dad C. Your girlfriend - well, the woman from the underwear Ad that you WISH was your girlfriend D. A fully configured quad processor box with 4 Gigs of DDR Ram, a terabyte of HD and top of the line graphics card. \n10. Some ridiculously contrived situation occurs in which you're dying - or something - and you have to give your last words. No, bugger it, you have to give the epitaph for your tombstone. Don't ask why, it's my bloody questionnaire! What is your epitaph? \nA. \"Live long and Prosper\" B. \"He was a good bloke really\" C. \"Press Return to Continue\" D. The entire Microsoft Site Licence Agreement documentation, including subclauses and appendices - because people like Stonemasons who work with Analogue media have it coming \n11. You're doing a questionnaire about how geeky you are, when you finally realise: \nA. It's Lunchtime B. It's Hometime C. It's Day Time D. There are no answers, but getting this far must be a warning sign in and of itself..... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2002, Simon Travaglia. Don't mess with his rights. \n"}

Here's BOFH armageddon","Link":"\/2002\/10\/24\/server_room_dangerous_heres_bofh\/","Content":"Letters : We hoped not to get any more of your pictures of dangerous server rooms , but you keep them coming, and they're too compelling to resist. \n[Last week's pictures are here ] \nArmageddon is in the air, as you have probably noticed, and a new generation of high tech destructive technology will be unleashed for the first time. But if only the .mil had asked the BOFHs for advice first. Check this out - \n\"A couple of years ago I was working for Lucent deploying their prepaid systems into client sites,\" writes one reader, who obviously, must not be named. \"One such assignment involved a lengthy deployment in Taiwan. The customer [who must not be named either] had two operational sites in Taipei - one which was a nicely set out server room in a high rise block, and the other was in a derelict factory in a very dodgy area. The factory was being ripped apart and undergoing 'civil reinforcement' to ensure it could withstand the island's regular earthquakes so to get into the place you had to climb over building waste and make your way through to the stairwell (the building wasn't lit) and climb 2 or 3 sets of stairs. Having successfully negotiated this commando course I was presented with the unbelievable sight of a 30 year old aircon unit which cooled about a third of the room, the rest being as hot as a mid summers afternoon at Ayer's rock.\" \n\"Ironically enough, a few days later a typhoon tore through the island and brought a complete stop to the project. Unfortunately the fire alarm was activated in the nice shiny high rise building of the first site, setting off the water sprinkler in the server room. Exit stage right several million dollars worth of equipment.\" \nThis story comes from the BBC. \nI've got a rather good story from when I was working at the BBC in London as a computer cleaning contractor. Every cable in the building ends up in the basement, as one nice big mess of spaghetti. The room immediately above this was decorated just after Christmas 2001. After painting this room, the decorators decided to tip their buckets of painty, murky water down a sink by the wall. This sink was not connected to anything. Said buckets of water proceeded to drop all over the floor and filter through a convenient hole. \n\"As luck would have it, this hole was immediately above the hundreds of network ports which are so crucial to the BBC's operation. So myself and my boss get called in to scrub the cables and ports clean without unplugging a single one. Which we do. In a hot dusty basement and it takes us a whole day. By now the cleaning staff have been made aware of the mess upstairs. Obviously you can't have a floor covered in paint, so they mop it. And mop it they do. Cue paint shower number 2. I don't think I need to say any more.\" \nThe two extraordinary pictures above are from an administrator at an educational institution, and these are surely the most twisted and dangerous server rooms of all. Is this you, then? \n\"No,\" said our correspondent. \"i thretened the good folks here at work that if they piss me off this is the result of their 'wulf\" , he replied. Fair enough, and keep up the fighting spirit. \nHere's one that can be vouched for, and was taken on a reader's site visit to the Netherlands. \n\"The air-conditioner in this case is in the ceiling above the left end of the server and it drips. The solution that the Dutch used was not to stick their finger in the hole to stop the leak (which is the traditional solution to problems such as porous dykes) but to give the server rack a \" rain hat - a metal plate with down-turned edges so that the drips end up on the floor rather than the inside of the machine. This cannot be a unique solution, but it's the only time I've seen it down on this scale. \n\"The names on the equipment have been blurred to protect the guilty.\" \nFinally we must give credit to two obviously contrived fakes. Completely bizarre, but noteworthy because they're an example of a computer expanding to fill the space available - not something that happens very often in Tokyo, or downtown San Francisco, I suspect. \nLet's hear it for the completely expandable, vertical server room:- \nProving the Duct Tape Cult marches from strength to strength. OK, we've mined this seam to exhaustion, we reckon. ® \nThe world's most dangerous server room? The world's most dangerous server rooms \n"}

We just get used to something and someone wants to change it!!\" \n(I feel an \"I still use Word Perfect Version 1 and it does what I want\" speech in the making) \n\"When I started here...\" \n(told you so) \n\"...we just used the editor thingy, and mailed each other what we needed.

We KNOW how to spell, people are just too lazy to use their DICTIONARIES!! \" \nI know both where this is heading and how long it's going to take to get there. I silently signal The PFY to ring me on my cellphone with an \"urgent\" problem. Seconds later, the phone rings and I make some appropriate affirmative noises to the pager message before making my excuses and slipping off with The PFY for a 'MAJOR FAULT' . I leave The Boss to it as he tries to match the requirements of the two main complainants. \nTHREE HOURS LATER... \n\"Well, I think I've come up with a workable solution that will please everyone!\" The Boss burbles to us proudly. \n\"You can never please everyone,\" The PFY responds, speaking from experience. \n\"Well I think we can. This a list of what people want - XP at the latest level, some who want NT4, a handful of Windows 98, one OS2 thingy and a couple of people who want their MSDOS stuff back again. Which doesn't sound all that hard. Anyway, I've made an executive decision, so we have to do it! So when can sort all that out?\" \nSomewhere, in the back reaches of my mind, a single piece of straw turns a camel into a paraplegic... \n\"In no time at all,\" I respond, leading The Boss towards the Tape Safes. \"In fact we keep all our media in a fireproof safe which rarely needs to be opened, thanks to a dinky built-in deposit slot.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yes,\" The PFY adds, turning the key and pulling the door release lever. \"It's designed for Night Deposits at petrol stations and convenience stores, but we use it to make sure our software is quickly securable.\" \nReally?

I got your name and contact from the heeeuge database of Register readers which they use to send unsolicited email and dob people in to their bosses for wasting company time on the web all afternoon when they get back from the pub. \nI consulted many sources of information on the web, including several search engines, a web self help utility, and 321 porn sites. They all agreed that you were a reliable person of good character apart from the fetish for donkeys and tomato paste. For this reason I feel that I can confide in you - and only you - my true identity. I am The PFY, otherwise know to you as the Pimply Faced Youth, assistant to the Bastard Operator From Hell. \nAs you know, The Bastard is a very wealthy person, having stolen, lied, cheated and blackmailed his way into several dubious consulting positions, including the one he now holds with a large and very cash-rich company. In recent days, the Bastard Operator from Hell has gone on an extended holiday under the guise of searching the web for a secure version of Explorer, and is not expected back for several years. \nBefore he left, he deposited a large amount of his wealth in a room in the basement of the company building, carefully labelled so as to frighten any inquisitive person from ever thinking of opening it. (I.e. \"Audio Tapes - Larry Ellison on the Future of Computing, Bill Gates on Microsoft's Vision and Richard Stallman on Free Beer\" ). A conservative estimate of this wealth is several thousand British Pounds, with a street value of several thousand English Pounds, or several billion turkish lire (or a couple of trillion Turkish lire if you read this in a couple of weeks, allowing for devaluation). \nNo-one apart from myself knows where this money is hidden as The Bastard was careful to wait until 4:58pm, when no-one was left in the building (and before night security clocked in) to put the money in place. \nI am now looking for a partner to help me invest these ill-gotten gains in high return stocks and bonds. \nI am humbly seeking your assistance in the following ways so that I can begin the transfer of this money to you to invest: \nIn return for your time and aid, I am fully prepared to give you half - that is 50% - of the contents of the locked briefcases when they have all been transferred from the company, to do with as you please. I am sure that you will agree that this is a most lucrative offer, and one which is unlikely to be made to just anyone. \nShould you be willing to partake in this venture and assist me in this undertaking, you can be assured that it will be concluded in a matter of a few weeks and with the utmost discretion. Any notification to the Inland Revenue authorities of the money is a matter up to you and you alone. \nI look forward to corresponding with you via email about this exciting opportunity in the near future - however, I would stress the need for security and discretion in this undertaking as my supervisor has a paranoia verging on ESP when it comes to losing any of his investments. Should he find out of the venture I am proposing, I am sure that his reaction would be both swift and vio \nasf;erio ® \n"}

Something's bound to happen once we crack the keg of meths...\" \n\"...yyyyeeeess, Right...

Well, as it's a contingency plan only, I suppose that we could agree to your requests just this once.\" \n\"Excellent,\" I cry, making a note in my diary to crash the site web server every day over the break and configure the console system to automatically restart it in a manner suggesting human intervention. \n\" HOWEVER , I think we'd better clearly define what our CRITICAL systems are,\" he continues, not as stupid as he looks. \n\"Email,\" one No-Life from the Helldesk mumbles, looking up from his PDA. \"We need to be able to keep in touch on email...\" \n\"Okay, EMAIL - anything else?\" \n\"Financials Server - so people get paid over the break?\" I suggest. \n\"Right!\" The Head agrees, scribbling away furiously. \n\"Web Server so the real world knows we're still in business?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"Unreal Tournament Server,\" The PFY slurs. \n\"Uhnn - what does that do?\" \n\"Uh, It's the machine that uses a simulation of real world to determine network connectivity and lag,\" I respond. \n\"Right, any others?\" \nNo-one stirs... \nBefore we can get onto the really exciting agenda items like the message in the (extremely late) corporate Christmas cards or personal letters from the CEO, both The PFY's and my pagers go off. \n\"If you'd excuse us,\" I blurt, getting up from the table. \"Looks like we may have a bit of a problem.\" \n... Downstairs, two minutes later... \n\"Okay!\" The PFY bubbles as we ferret through the mail cart (in response to the mail delivery page). \"What are we looking for this time?\" \n\"Any parcel shaped like a bottle, any package which is well wrapped and\/or addressed to The Boss or the Head of IT. Double word score if it's got a vendor's name and\/or ribbon on it. They always leave it to the last minute to send the really good stuff...\" \n...Four Parcels later... \n\"Ok, it feels to be like we've got one whiskey and some wine, so I'll clip the parcel open while you get the substitute bottles of watered-down cheap Turkish drain cleaner.\" \n..

Is the cost of a bar of soap and some natty threads too much? Such weighty questions were provoked by our recent letter \"OK - I smell a bit\" - but leave us BoFHs alone! from a sysadmin who resented being relegated to the smelly underclass by know-nothing IT types. \nHere are your views. \nI just read the reply you got from a Mr. Angry, and I do need to voice a bit of support. However, I'd like to voice a more balanced opinion about the issue of IS\/IT staff members and their personal appearance, as well. As a member of this group for over 7 years, I feel I've got a fairly good handle on this. \nWhile it's true that the general impression of us lowly techs is less than fully desirable in the typically formal office environment, it's also generally accepted that the people who do the \"dirty\" work of crawling underneath\/behind desks and into the guts of a typical office building can deviate from the traditional formal or semi-formal (read: business casual, whatever that's supposed to mean) office dress-code. \nI'll use myself as an example. In my early days of office life, I was required to be dressed in a button-down shirt, khaki or black pants, and dress shoes. Obviously, working underneath desks is more difficult in that type of attire than it would be in a t-shirt and jeans. I wore out 2 pair of khaki pants within one week of working like this and approached management for a compromise. Jeans and t-shirts were them permitted specifically to myself (the only IS\/IT staff member at the time) as long as it wasn't disruptive to the other office staff. That meant no holes and no obscene words or images. I even found that a good, relatively heavy, button-down shirt worked well with jeans and made a good impression on management. \nSince that first experience, I've made sure to place expectations on a potential future employer during the interview that formal office dress will not work for the type of work that I would be hired for, and most have been accommodating. It's more important to be able to do one's job than to look good doing it, which seems to be the point Mr. Angry makes. However, there's a happy medium that should be reached with the policymakers if the existing policy hinders one's ability to do one's job. \nI've often said that to change the mind(s) of management, you'll need to make a solid business case for them to do so. Explaining why a formal dress-code hinders your ability to do your job should be easy enough if you're worn a hole through the knee on a pair of pants. If your manager is unwilling to grant you an exception, simply request that the company reimburse you for clothing that is consumed while on company time. Shoes can be a safety issue, especially if they're slippery on carpet. Is the company willing to accept the risk that you'll slip and fall while lifting \"up to 50 pounds\" as most companies seem to require of us techs? It's less expensive, and makes more business sense, to allow you to deviate from the dress code than to force you to follow it to the letter. Instead of looking like they want you to look, you'd be a safer, more productive employee that costs the company less money. Most managers are more likely to see it your way if you were to explain it to them in terms they understand: the bottom line of their budget and productivity charts. \nTodd Lynch \nSo you must dress to get well. Or is it that simple? \nTo The Smelly Techies: \nListen up guys, wake up and smell....well you're own armpits. \nI too am a techie, and I too was once the mug crawling around vents trying to figure out what the hell the obviously drunk cable contractors did when wiring up the building. \nI completely agree that the ideal clothing, as far as practicality goes, is loose fitting casual lothes. \nHowever, have you thought about how long you really want to be in your current position? \nDo you really want to be shouting down aggressive members of the sales team who cannot work out how to switch their projectors on? \nDo you think your patience may one day run out when yet another director drives off with his iPaq left on top of his car? \nF**K THAT! \nGet yourself into a suit, shirt and tie. Keep a spare shirt and trousers in the office for when you get grubby. So your stuff is going to get dirty, so what? It almost always washes out. Hell you can even get machine washable suits from M&S these days, that will cut down on your dry cleaning bill. \nGet a hair cut, and buy some shower gel. Keep deodorant in your drawer at work (not in the server room, it's flammable). \nThe only way management is ever going to start making good decisions, with sound technical knowledge, is when the grubby techies clean themselves up and get promoted. \nYou'll also find that talking to your users becomes easier. Let's face it, half of what we do is basically telling people that they're being stupid.

I work from home and I still choose to wear casual slacks and good dress shirts probably half the time (why? because they are comfortable, and a dress shirt breathes better then most T-shirts). \nBuy a suit and shirt that actually fit and chances are you'll stop complaining about how uncomfortable they are. Same goes for fabrics, real fabric (i.e. high quality cotton or wool with a tight weave) does not itch. Or maybe you should see a doctor about it. \nKurt Seifried, \nOK, that's decided.

No longer will sysadmins or network administrators be able to get by on technical talent alone. In the near future, they're going to need - gasp - people skills. \nFor many people, the phrase \"IT tech\" conjures up a vision of the Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH) - a crass , grumpy, intolerant freak dressed in black who sits in his cube for hours typing code, only emerging to growl at passers-by as he heads to the latest idiot's desk to fix their network settings or plug in the computer that \"won't work.\" ( Tina, you cheeky monkey - Ed. ) \nBut admins have to develop some manners or face losing their positions to those with more social graces, says Freedman. Bedside manner, the ability to talk to a client in language that the client can understand, is a key element of success. \nFreedman's idea of the perfect IT tech: \"Like a partner in a law firm, he knows that his job is a little bit services and a little bit relationship. Like an accountant that needs to keep up with changes in tax law, he knows that he needs to keep up with changes in technology or else his skills will become obsolete quickly. He's a combination of subject matter expert, business consultant, advisor, trainer and project manager.\" \nSound scary? Freedman says that you can develop the necessary skills by designing your own personal career development program, that \"includes not just the latest technical boot camp, but also incorporates sales skills, project skills, business context, and communication. Most community colleges offer professional development programs that include skills like active listening, presentation skills, facilitation & negotiation.\" \nFreedman also recommends subscribing to business magazines like Fortune or BusinessWeek to facilitate conversation with pointy-hairs. Not only that, but it would be smart to study trends in IT so you can make recommendations for your department. \nEmployers who want the best in IT talent should look for potential employees who have the right attitude, and not just aptitude, says Freedman. \"There are a lot of IT techs out there who will look at these suggestions and say 'this is a lot of bull! I'm a genius at my technical area and, if I'm not a good communicator or a good presenter, they can take it or leave it! They need me more than I need them!' That's an employee I wouldn't want on my team, and wouldn't recommend to my clients that they hire, no matter how strong her technical skills might be.\" \nReason being, of course, that the economy and job market aren't what they used to be. The years-long economic boom trained legions of IT workers that their employers did, in fact, need them more. But that's not completely true anymore, when jobs and dollars are scarce. Employers now have to squeeze as much nebulous \"productivity\" from their staff as possible to satisfy the psychological bottom line. \nNot only that, but the very counter-culture mystique that has surrounded IT people and has been responsible in some measure for their job security is evaporating, according to Freedman. ?What we saw back in the original counter-culture days of the 1960's, when long hair on men went from being a badge of certain beliefs to a part of mainstream style, is also happening in the world of tech. \n?When Linux makes the front cover of Business Week magazine, and articles featuring ?software nomads? and ?open-source vagabonds? pop up in the business press, it's clear that counter-culture and conventional culture have merged.? \nWhich means that, since sysadmins are now officially just like everyone else, they are expected to act just like everyone else ? no snarling allowed. ® \nCopyright © Newsforge.com \nSMEs sniff at smelly techies \"OK - I smell a bit\" - but leave us BoFHs alone!

This year, the proportion of managers devoting that level of budget to wage packets rose to 61 per cent. \nTypically, base salaries have risen by around five per cent, said Meta, the same rate as last year. However, 26 per cent of IT managers said they expect IT wage budgets to rise next year, compared with 22 per cent in last year's survey. \nAnd BOFHs will continue to receive superior remuneration to their non-techie colleagues, the survey shows. During 2002, 67 per cent of companies said they pay IT staff more on average than non-IT staff; in the 2003 survey, that figure had risen to 75 per cent. \n\"This percentage is getting close to the historic high of 2000, in which 80 per cent of respondents reported paying higher salaries to IT employees,\" said Meta in a statement. \"This compensation imbalance can be partially attributed to the overall need to retain key IT staff.\" ® \n"}

This is one of those moments in your career that you dream of.

My BOFH's ex-Russian army","Link":"\/2003\/06\/13\/help_my_bofhs_exrussian_army\/","Content":"If you thought BOFHs were bad enough, welcome a new breed that you really don't want to mess with - ex-Russian military sysadmins trained by the British Ministry of Defence and let loose on the world with a Cisco qualification and a point to prove in civvy street. \nAs incredible as it may seem, the UK government is currently funding 10 retraining centres across Russia that give ex-army, airforce and navy officers the chance to learn sought-after new skills including IT and economics to smooth their path into civilian life. \nThe scheme was kicked off in 1995 at Rostov-on-Don following an agreement by the British and Russian defence ministers in 1992 that the UK would finance an aid programme to help Russia while its military went through heavy reforms. \nRostov was given academy status by Cisco three years ago and in September 2001 started its first Cisco Networking Academy Program. So far only one person out of 40 to 50 students a year has not made the qualification. \"They are very highly motivated people,\" the project manager and RAF officer Maxwell Jardim explains. \nMr Jardim tells us that anyone that has served five years in the Russian military is entitled to apply for the course and if accepted they are free to sell their services to whoever will pay them. \"Most remain in Russia, they work in local companies, normally as networking consultants or systems administrators but I know of one or two that have got jobs abroad - one in London.\" \nWith the qualification the same as Cisco courses the world over, and with networking experts in high demand, the programme has proved extremely successful at moving all sorts of soldiers through. Although anyone can apply, Jardim tells us: \"The vast majority are officers and from the army or air force - we do not yet have any from the navy but then we are far away from the sea here.\" \nAs for specialisms, it is a broad cross-section: \"We do not normally require them to have done something, although most have had exposure to IT before.\" That means, Maxwell says, that it could be anyone from an intelligence officer to an infantryman. \nIs there a security risk with all this? \"From a military point of view, there is no security risk attached. The information they are getting is not of a military nature.\" \nSo while your BOFH will not be a spy sending Moscow all your private secrets, it is possible that he knows combat sombo and could kill you stone dead within five seconds. Which is something to bear in mind because you pick up that phone to tech support. ® \nRelated link Details of the whole retraining scheme \n"}

The server's gone down, see?\" I say, pointing at a red icon on the services display. \n\"You're joking!\" The Boss blurts. \"But it's got redundant power supplies!\" \n\"Indeed it has, but they don't work when one's dead and the other is outside the machine...\" \n\"I thought the machines could work without interruption?\" \n\"They can, but unfortunately our engineer can't. The PFY asked him if he wanted a coffee, which must have confused 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' in his brain. So he pulled the wrong supply out. I was going to check before he did it - but as you know, I don't like to ask questions...\" \n\"RIGHT!\" The Boss shouts as he storms off to his office. \nTen minutes later The Boss informs us that the engineer concerned is on his way back to the office and the senior engineer has been dispatched to us. \n... \n\"..a real bastard,\" I say to The PFY, finishing my description of the engineer in question. \"The sort of person who gives helpful tips to your boss like how the dangling cables you have are a workplace hazard and how he couldn't help noticing that you're using root for day-to-day work - and how insecure that is..\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Oh yes. An out and out brownnoser. A cleft presser of the First Order. AND he notes all his tips and observations on his report and files it with his office. THEN , next time something happens, they dig through it for a reason to void the maintenance agreement.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Oh yes. He's the guy they send to punish people. AND , he makes a point of coming in and advising you through what he's doing, every step of the way.\" \n\"Arse Covering?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Partly, but mainly to punish you for not issuing him a permanent swipe card to access the room night and day. So he wanders in and out of the machine room to make you keep getting up to let him in.\" \nOur conversation is interrupted by the arrival of the man himself, complete with titanium toolkit. \n\"So where is it?\" he asks. \n\"In the machine room,\" I respond. \n\"OK, can you give me a card to get in and out?\" \nAnd so it begins... \nTen minutes later... \n\"Just about to install the new power supply,\" he says, once the computer room door has latched shut. \n\"Good.\" \n\"And could someone let me into the machine room, as I don't have a c..\" \n\"Sure,\" The PFY says cheerfully \nTen minutes later... \n\"New power supply installed, I'm just going to box up the old one >click< and fill in my form.\" \n\"Uh-huh\" . \n\"Oh, could you let me back into the...\" \n\"Sure,\" The PFY seethes. \n. . . \nLooking back, I think it was probably the trip back to collect his toolkit that broke The PFY. The repeated trips in and out to let us know he was about to power the system on, check the hot plugability was working, then confirming it was all working, boxing up the old power supply, borrowing a pen to label the old power supply 'faulty', packing up to go, etc, must have slowly eroded his patience. \nThe phonecall from the Maintenance Company asking if we'd seen their engineer was the first thing I knew about it. \nThen there was The PFY's new titanium tool kit. \nI don't like to ask questions... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

You say, 'Hang on while I check my calendar,' fire up ECF, select the length of unavailability you want (in months), then click on the maximum allowable free time (in hours), and the ECF will fill your calendar with copies of past appointments, random specialist appointments, religious observations, etc. that you couldn't possibly attend the event he has in mind.\" \n\"You know that actually sounds like a bloody useful tool - but what about if you reversed it to make yourself more avai--\" \n\"You mean my ECD program - Emergency Calendar Deleter,\" I interrupt. \"Select a date window click the GO button and your Calendar will have less content than a software support agreement.\" \n\"You haven't really done that.\" \n\"Sure.

Those 802.11 cards work through walls and floors?\" \n\"Not so bad in this building, but in any case, I also flipped the on-board Bluetooth on his PDA and installed a sprinkling of Bluetooth cards in strategic places round the building which make the location a lot more granular.\" \n\"Sneaky.

Since 'catching' the Boss and I (allegedly) browsing some disgusting porn together she's embarked on a voyage of blackmail and extortion which deserves a special mention in the annals of history... \nNot only has she secured the Boss' office, forcing him to work out in her cubicle (the Boss telling everyone that it was his idea, to allow him to bond with his workers) but she's also getting me (well, the PFY, as part of an extortion contra deal whereby I pass on some guilty secrets of the PFY that he believes no one knows) to run errands for her. Like penning the performance appraisal she'll be getting the Boss to sign off on at the end of her three-month trial period... Not to mention some despicably menial tasks designed to slowly but surely wipe away remaining vestiges of your self-respect. \nWell, the PFY's self-respect. \nYou have to admire the professionalism of that. Some people would just make their point and be done with it, but she wants to snuff the smoking wick of our dignity. \nWell, the PFY's dignity. \n\"You know what she wants me to do now?\" he snaps, holding up a large carry bag. \n\"What?\" \n\"Clean her shoes!\" \n\"So take them down to the shoe shine man at Vi--\" \n\"No, she wants me to shine them. She says she'll know if I get someone else to do it.\" \n\"And you told her to get stuffed?\" \n\"I... Well, I s'pose I could shine them this once...\" \n\"If you give in to a blackmailer, you'll always be giving in!\" I caution. \nThe PFY wanders off dejectedly without further comment, which is always bad sign. He might be beginning to crack... \nSomething has to be done. The PFY is (mostly) a human being, and I can't just stand by and let his dignity be drained out of him like this. \nThough I do wish I had a digital camera... \nSome sort of peace offering is in order. I catch the Boss' PA outside his (her) office and hand over the brown envelope I'd prepared earlier. \n\"I take it this is some sort of trap where I open this and someone leaps out and catches me with company secrets?\" she asks derisively, shoving the envelope straight into the shredder. \n\"Uhhhh, no, that was the 200 quid you told me to steal out of the Boss' petty cash. Which you just shoved into the shredder.\" \n\"Ah well, get us another lot then will you?\" she asks, nonchalantly. \n\"Ooooooooh, cruel and ruthless!\" the PFY says, wandering up. \"I like that in a major home appliance!\" \nNo matter what some authors say, silence is not deafening - it's just silence. I swear the entire office is so quite I can hear a laser printer in the next building jamming... \n\"You can't trick me into hurting you on camera,\" she informs the PFY, nodding at his buttonhole. \nThe PFY again wanders off dejectedly, and there's only one thing for it - a head to head. \n\"Can I have a quiet word in your... office?\" \n\"Sure,\" she responds. \n[SLAM!] \n\"I think we both know this can't go on,\" I start. \"It's no good for the workplace to have people demoralised and stressed like this.\" \n\"Why not? You do it!\" \n\"Yes, but I do it in a structured way.\" \n\"What's structured about trapping someone in a lift and sending them up and down between floors until they're sick - like you did three weeks ago?\" \n\"I waited until after they'd had a biriyani for lunch! An amateur would have done it before the meal!\" \n\"And when you extort money out of someone after a chance encounter in a lift with a co-worker in a moment of weakness at the Friday night social drinks in their first week ?\" she gabbles. \n\"Beg pardon?\" \n\"Don't play the innocent with me - I know it was you!\" \n\"Pretend for a moment it wasn't - what are you talking about again?\" \n\"This!\" she snaps, handing over a black and white frame from the CCTV lift. \n\"It's you and...

I'm applying for a technical role and just wanted some tips on how to put my resumé together to give me a better chance at getting the job!\" \n\"I see,\" I respond, leaping into the conversation once I sense blood in the water... \"Well, lets see... How to make your CV the one they look at...\" \n\"Well, there's the obvious things...\" the PFY chips in. \n\"Yes?\" the wannabe asks eagerly. \n\"Well a lot of CVs suffer from being far too short.

I mean there's barely enough room to list all your primary school grades, let alone the rest of your qualifications?\" \n\"Primary school grades? Really?\" \nOh yes, I don't know how many times I've seen them left out of a CV. You see you can tell a lot about a person's character by how well they did in primary school, which subjects and what scores. I mean people cram their CV with tertiary qualifications when every real employer knows those scores are only there to get a job. \n\"I prefer that the person leaves out any history of tertiary education,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Really, because this book I have about writing the best resumé says that--\" \n\"That would be a book written by a person NOT in a technical role? Written to make money out of people wanting technical roles?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"As opposed to a couple of people who've employed countless people in technical roles?\" \n\"Yes, I suppose you're right.\" \n\"So anyway, another obvious thing is you want your CV to stand out from the others.\" \n\"Yes!\" \n\"So print it on pink paper.\" \n\"PINK?\" \n\"Yes - it won't get lost and it will stand out from the others.\" \n\"But isn't pink a little... well... effeminate?\" \n\"NOT if you mention 'Shagging a different bird every night' in your Hobbies and Interests,\" I counter. \n\"Shagging a different bird every night?\" \n\"Yes, you're right, KNOBBING a different bird every night.\" \n\"Really?

There was one on a CV recently which was absolutely inspired.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yeah, the guy was a long distance runner and so he had a full page photo of him in running gear crossing the finish line in a race. You play sport?\" \n\"No.\" \nGood answer - you're after a technical role after all. Which reminds me, put down 'watching TV' as a hobby too - employers like to know that they'll find their employees at home if they have to be called out after hours. \n\"Got any hobbies?\" \n\"No... I used to play D&D when I was a kid...\" \n\"Bloody fantastic. Put it in as a hobby, and have a photo of you in D&D gear as the cover page. A wizard or something.\" \n\"Really? I thought just a normal photo of me in a suit...\" \n\"Which they'll see you in at interview time. You're trying to establish a character that people will remember - right?\" \n\"Right!\" \n\"How far did you get with D&D?\" \n\"I was a 17th level Mage with a +10 Wand of Lightning!\" he blurts, unable to suppress the pride. \n\"Right - list that in your acheivements. Oh, and put a 'Bronze lifesaving award' in too.\" \n\"Won't they check?\" \n\"How? Anyway, if it ever came down to it, a bronze lifesaving award only means you're skilled enought to rescue someone from a handbasin, so it won't matter.\" \n\"But what if they find out?\" \n\"No one ever checks qualifications! So while you're at it slap in some fake certifications - like MCSE, MCSA, CCNA, etc - no one really knows what they mean. If you're asked at the interview just say you didn't bring the certificates because they're framed.\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"Oh, and best to keep it informal too. So in the covering letter, don't be using things like 'Dear Sir' and 'Yours Sincerely'.\" \n\"No?\" \n\"No! Use things like 'H3y Dud3z!!!!!' and 'LaT3R l33tR!'\" \n\"Oh. OK.\" \n\"Well, I think that should think cover it.\" \n\"You missed out criminal record,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Oh, right. Put in something like 'breaking and entering' or 'theft as a servant' a couple of years back.\" \n\"WHY?!?!\" the wannabe gasps. \n\"Look,\" the PFY says quietly, glancing around in case we're being listened to. \"Occasionally, technical roles call for a little bit of the old thud and blunder - say you need to check out a user's workstation off the record - or maybe they'll want you to wander over to competitors site and uplift some information - at night. They want someone who isn't a career criminal, but who does know how to handle the black-ops, so to speak.\" \n\"Riiiight,\" he burbles, seeing himself as the James Bond of the technical world. \"Thanks, I'll get right onto it!\" \n... Three days later .... \n\"Morning,\" the Boss burbles, trundling into the office with benevolence on full beam. \"I've just managed to fill that technical role in R&D, and I believe you two were instrumental in helping him with that fantastic CV of his...\" \nSigh. \nI think I'd like to be killed now please... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

And then having a test about a subject you haven't studied for. In a tunnel that just keeps getting smaller and smaller. \nIn other words, a liability. \nThe crunch came when he committed to buying all the scheduled desktop replacements at a local retailer advertising package deals because that way everyone got a scanner, inkjet printer and modem in the bundle, which was a bargain. If that wasn't bad enough, he decided to give them a choice of desktop or tower models. And, as every administrator with even the SLIGHTEST clue knows, the LAST thing you give your users is a choice. \nAnd the calls haven't stopped since. And not just from the people wanting to know the virtues of horizontal over vertical - a PFY strongpoint apparently - but also from those whose desktop wasn't scheduled for replacement but has suddenly got a pen up the power supply. \nThe coincidence intrigues me, and after a bit of legwork the common denominator is revealed: young, cute, female. I lock the PFY in the lift for two hours with the Pan Pipe music turned up to 10 so he can contemplate his sins. \nSo the Boss has to go. Only it's getting tricky now because the Head of IT is a bit twitchy about all the Health and Safety fines we've racked up in the past. It seems that being an IT manager has a job danger index approaching that of an Elite republican guard. \n... \n\"Long Term Secondment?\" the PFY asks, as I unveil my plan. \n\"Yep. You give someone enough info that they sneakily create themselves a cushy job in another group, then drop the role like second period maths once you've appointed someone to replace them. It's a great idea which someone posted to one of the Bastard blogs! Wish I'd thought of it myself!\" \n\"So, maybe we could put them in Shipping?\" he offers. \n\"Nah, they've only got two people - it apparently needs to be in a reasonably large department that's not actually growing, but might possibly want to add people to bolster the impression of dynamism.\" \n\"THE BEANCOUNTERS!\" \n\"Yes!\" I concur, joyfully. \"Now all we've got to do is think up some reason why he'd want them and they'd want him.\" \n\"He'd make the company more money?\" \n\"Nah, no one cares about that. The best motivators are personal prestige or the chance to shaft someone whose guts they really hate.\" \n\"Like us, you mean?\" \n\"Yes. Good point. But what role?\" \n\"What about IT Asset Management! They're always asking us to track down 'lost' inventory.\" \n\"Yes, and they'd been keen to sniff out something dodgy!\" \n\"But would the Boss go for it?\" \n\"With a PA running his life and using his office by extortion?\" \n\"Ah...\" \n. . . \nTwo days later the fix is in. After a ten-minute Google frenzy I find a couple of articles to support the need for an IT Asset Manager, fake up an 'IT-Auditweek' newsletter with the links concerned and implying that organisations that didn't have an IT Manager in the Auditing role were probably losing millions of quid every year to e-shrinkage, and then anonymously e-mail it to some senior beancounters. \nThe Boss fell over himself to get the role, saving me having to lie that the company auditors were a little concerned with the expenses his PA had been claiming for him. Quicker than you can say Technical Manager in charge of Asset Management and Tracking, the Boss was one! \nFor about a day - until the PFY helpfully noted that the same functionality was built into our current helpdesk software. But you know what they say, one door closes and another one slams shut and has planks nailed over it... \n\"Lucky I didn't move out of my office,\" the Boss chuckles nervously, wandering up to his door. \n\" Your office?\" his PA asks, looking up from his desk. \n\"Well, TECHNICALLY my office.\" \n\"No, technically it's my office,\" she responds, pointing at the new nameplate. \"I noticed the transfer and applied for the role, what with my intimate knowledge of the area.\" \nOh, she's good! \n\"But I'm back!\" \n\"No, I believe you're redundant,\" she responds, waving a recently delivered sheet of paper around. \n\"But that's constructive dismissal!\" \n\"It's only constructive if we create the position - but you thought this role up and proposed it, didn't you?\" \n. . . \nAnd about now I'm getting that nasty deep down feeling that I've been played. \n\"But I am looking for an assistant...\" \nOh, she's really good. \nWomen like that, you can't help imagining what they'd look like administering a Linux farm. \nOK, so I need to get out more... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

What criteria are you looking for exactly?\" \n\"Oh, all sorts!

But then people are rarely happy. They want 802.11b and they want it yesterday, and you're the one who's supposed to have installed it. Yesterday. However, as a seasoned computing veteran, before you put your budget where someone's mouth has been, just ask yourself these questions: \n1. Mobile comms in your workplace currently consists of: a. Full 802.11b coverage b. Partial 802.11b coverage c. Unadvertised 802.11b coverage in your region the IT Dept d. Anywhere the roll of thinwire cable can get to! \n2. You would install 802.11 in your workplace except that: a. You're unsure of the security implications b. The building would have too many dead spots c. The budget would be difficult to justify d. Half the staff would come to work with tinfoil wrapped round their heads \n3. Wireless would get most use in meeting rooms to: a. Allow people to take online notes of meeting progress b. Allow people to read their email during slow periods c. Allow people to send sneaky messages to each other d. Keep people 'abreast' of the porn revolution \n4. In your opinion your users would judge the throughput of the wireless network in: a. Bytes per second b. Kilobytes per second c. Megabytes per second d. Smutty movie frames per second \n5. Using your knowledge of the people concerned, the mobile devices commonly used by your technical staff would most likely be: a. PDA b. Laptop c. Webcam d. Shoecam \n6. An anonymous survey to determine the most-requested places to put 802.11b coverage would find most demand for: a. Cafeteria b. Designated smoking areas c. Reception d. The gents' toilets \n7. After a lengthy campaign advertising coverage areas, a user complains about a massive dead spot. You know that when you get to their room you're going to find: a. Their PCMCIA card has popped out b. Their PCMCIA aerial has broken off c. They don't have, nor have they ever had, a PCMCIA card d. Their desktop machine on a trolley in the corridor \n8. The security of your 802.11b solution is ensured by: a. WEP b. Access restricted to named hardware addresses c. VPN connectivity d. Burying the bodies of the people who try to get around with it \n9. An annoying user repeatedly comes to complain about the poor bandwidth in his area. You: a. Add another access point in an effort to double the bandwidth b. Move the access point closer to his area c. Do a site survey d. Do a site survey. Then install a large ungainly microwave dish precariously above his workstation. Set to DEFROST... \n10. The best way to encourage uptake in 802.11b at your workplace would be posters: a. Noting 802.11b on site b. Advising of troubleshooting techniques c. Advertising best coverage areas d. Advertising 'Kournokova nude - only on wireless!' \nMostly a: A technical response for a technical workplace. In fantasyland. Mostly b: You mean well, and give your users a lot of credit. Mostly c: A practical response from someone who's seen the highs and lows of the user community.

In addition, two in three (66 per cent) of those quizzed believe a lack of awareness about risk management at board level in having a similar negative impact on corporate security. \n\"An ideal answer is to establish a well-funded and well-staffed security communication programme. But developing the corporate culture to support that level of investment takes years of effective communication by the existing security staff,\" said META Group security analyst Tom Scholtz. \n\"In fact, most organisations will fail to successfully secure their technology environment simply because the security staff lacks the communication skills to create this shift in corporate culture.\" \nMETA suggests that annual reviews and initial hiring criteria should not only measure a security staffer's technical capabilities, but also the ability to communicate. \nWhether disseminating policy to end users or presenting budgets for senior-level executives, communication is a critical skill for most security staff and should therefore be given equal opportunity for review. \nOne area that managers can focus on as a measure of security communication skills is the end user's knowledge of policy and policy awareness, META advises. \n\"Certainly, the ability to configure and maintain security enforcement tools is at the core of the position, but the importance of communicating security policy to end users is critical to obtain their cooperation in security initiatives and therefore should not be given short shrift,\" said Scholtz. \n\"As security teams focus on policy and audit\/compliance, the success of those security initiatives depends on obtaining cooperation from end users, executive management, and IT and business managers.\" ® \n"}

Don't you realise the risks?!?!?\" \n\"What risks?\" \n\"A fire could spread from your tape safe room through the open fire door to the Computer Room!\" \n\"That's ridiculous!\" I cry, re-entering the conversation. \"A fire's FAR more likely to start in the Computer Room - especially with those flagons of isopropyl alcohol on top of warm equipment.\" \n\"You're supposed to keep flammibles in the dangerous items cupboard!\" \n\"We swapped that with the bloke from stores who was told HE had to keep HIS stocks of isopropyl alcohol in a dangerous items cupboard.\" \n\"You SWAPPED it? What for?\" \n\"His bottles of isopropyl alcohol, I seem to recall,\" the PFY responds. \n\"This is all going in my report you know!\" he threatens. \n\"You should do what you think is best,\" I say to plactate him. \n\"I will. Now I want to look in this Computer Room.\" \n\"Oh.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Well, I'd like to let you in, but if you remember back to last time H&S had a slow day - probably all of six weeks ago - you told us that the Computer Room was a dangerous place and we shouldn't permit visitors.\" \n\"Which you said you don't have.\" \n\"No - yet we do have a visitor's extinguisher. Ironic, isn't it?\" \n\"Well I still want to look in the Computer Room!\" \n\"No can do!\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"You haven't been on the Computer Room safety briefing you people insisted that visitors must attend prior to entering the Computer Room.\" \n\"How about I do that now?\" he responds sarcastically. \n\"Are you sure? It's quite involved...\" \n\"Positive!\" he snaps triumphantly. \n. . . Ten minutes later . . . \n\"THAT'S RIGHT!\" I shout through the Computer Room door and over the halon discharge alarm \"KEEP LOW WHEN YOU CRAWL TO THE DOOR, THAT WAY THE HALON WILL HAVE LESS EFFECT!\" \n\"Will it?\" the PFY asks, peering into the Computer Room. \n\"No idea, but we'll find out when he gets over here and I tell him he dropped his swipe card in the middle of the room.\" \n\"So that's the safety briefing is it?\" the PFY asks. \"Lock them in the Computer Room and test the Halon?\" \n\"It depends. I've 'prepared' lessons on 'Navigating the Computer Room in the Dark' - which we've always enjoyed in the past - 'The dangers of racks without earthquake restraints', 'Why you should check how secure the grating floor is before stepping into a comms riser' and, if he's still moving, 'Why we always treat wires as live'.\" \n\"Ooooh, can I teach that one?\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Of course you can,\" I say magnanioumously. \nAfter all, Health and Safety is everyone's responsibility. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

{"Date":1067212800000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2003\/10\/27\/","Title":"BOFH and The Conference","Link":"\/2003\/10\/27\/bofh_and_the_conference\/","Content":"Episode 14 \nSo The PFY and I have been shafted by The Boss who's signed us up to a one-day \"conference\" in the city which is so airy-fairy it should really just be called a trade show. \nOrdinarily, as a computing professional, you'd expect to disagree with people on matters of technology on occasion. For instance, someone might have the position that Word was the best editor of all time, whilst others might rightly suppose that emacs is. Similarly, someone may suggest that Microsoft has a suite of tools and settings designed to ensure application and desktop security, whilst others might rightly say that's a load of crap. \nHOWEVER , when faced with the 'expert' opinion that a vendor's machine runs faster or is more robust because the monitor is silver or that the box has a number of flashing LEDs to indicate activity, you find yourself reaching for the 18-inch hammer-of-truth to perform some impromptu vendor reprogramming. \nWhat also irks me are vendor's 'technical' people (whose qualifications would be almost sufficient get them an extra role in a remake of \"Deliverance\" ) who are at the conference to give you the 'expert opinion straight from the horse's mouth'. True, there's a part of the horse's anatomy involved, but it's not the mouth... \nSo I roll up to the conference bright, early and annoyed and am immediately cornered by a meet-and-greet person who tells me she \"wants to make me feel right at home here\" . \n\"Excellent Nancy, that's great. So where do I find the hot curry, case of lager, a sofa and TV set?\" \nNancy chuckles lightly, looking for an exit, but is sadly caught in my tractor beam as unfortunately I must have \"accidentally\" locked the entrance door behind me to give me a large amount of time alone with the vendors and their freebies before the great unwashed arrive and get all the good stuff. The PFY, meantime, is standing outside in a suit, complete with fake nametag, redirecting people to the rear of the building, for \"safety reasons\" . \n\"So what do you do... uh... Simon?\" Nancy asks, making polite conversation while vainly waiting for a new conference attendee arrives to allow her to step away politely. \n\"Well I'd have to admit to being a Systems Administrator,\" I respond. \n\"Really? Just like Roger over there?\" she responds, pointing at a sad vendor droid - made even MORE sad by the fact that he's scrawled MCSE under his name badge just so people know EXACTLY who they're messing with... \n\"nnnnYes indeed. Roger and I are alike in the same way that a town reservoir could be likened to a toilet cistern,\" I respond, unable to suppress a hint of snobbish elitism. \n\"Oh, I see - You mean there's a difference of scale involved?\" \n\"Well yes, but also that Roger's job involves taking shit from people\" . \n\"Excuse me?!?!\" \n\"Sorry, I can't believe I said that! Please forgive me! What I MEANT to say was that Roger was full of crap!\" \n\"But Roger's company is a Platinum Sponsor of this show!\" Nancy cries loudly, in case her loyalty is in question. \n\"That would be the company that's marketing an anti-spam product based around Bayesian filtering - only they call it a 'patented statistical classification process', after porting some freely available source to .NET and whacking a 500 quid price tag on it.\" \n\"I... uh...\" \n\"But wait, there's more! You can, for a small fee, upgrade the aforementioned pirated software to one which also sends you email to tell you that it's rejected a message!\" \n\"But wouldn't that...\" \n\"Defeat the purpose of the application? Why yes it would. And, talking to Roger there's another bloke whose company sells 100 Base T Network cards for PCs which ALSO have a wireless adaptor onboard - so that your machine can remain connected even if your network goes down!\" \n\"Does that happen a lot?\" \n\"Funny you should ask - No. And if it DOES go down it's generally because a core network device has failed - which the access point is connected to - so you have no connectivity anyway.\" \n\"Well, I'm sure there are a lot of other worthwhile products here today.\" \n\"Including the company of that bloke at the reception desk over there which has released a bug-fixed version of their software which actually WORKS now. Only they put the words 'New Generation' on it so they can charge their customers extra for the version upgrade.\" \n\"So if this whole show is a waste of time, why are you here?\" \n\"Why indeed. Because my Boss enrolled me without asking, and not to attend would be a waste of good quiddage, but more importantly, for the drinks and freebies.\" \n\"You're attending to get drunk and get free merchandise?\" \n\"You betcha!\" \n\"Isn't that just a LITTLE shallow?\" Nancy asks sarcastically. \n\" SOME people might say so.\" \n\"And YOU would say?\" \n\"Gimme some Pens! And one of those cool rulers with the calculator in it. And the stress ball. And the elastic modem patch cable. And some of those....\" \n. . . \nSuffice to say the show didn't pan out as well as expected. That said, the original objective - having The Boss removed from the Company's Conference mailing list - did eventuate, so the whole thing wasn't a complete write-off. \nI never did get that curry, though. \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

Where's the Magstripe duplicator?\" \n\"Running on my box!\" I snap, looking for signs of movement, so to speak, from the Boss' office. \n. . . \nOne READ and two VERIFY swipes later we have all the info we need for a duplicate card issue... \n\"OK, I've got the Magstripe info. How do we get his PIN number?\" \n\"Isn't it written on his card?\" I ask, guessing at the high standards of security the Boss would aspire to. \n\"Oh yes...\" \nWe slip back to the Boss's office to return the keys only to find him deep in conversation with a particularly annoying helldesk geek about the virtues of patching your system regularly to protect you from virus infection. I have to say that I'm all for users patching their machines, I'm just not happy with the guy spending half his life wandering around the office talking to people and doing bugger all else. That's a TECHNICAL role! \n\"Bloody hell, is that Linus Torvalds?!\" I cry, pointing out the Boss' window. \n\"Who?\" the Boss and helldesk geek ask. \nIt's my fault, of course, for assuming too much and aiming too high. \n\"No it's not, it's the bird with the huge hands from the bikini commercial,\" the PFY adds, going for the save. \n\"Where?\" the pair ask, scrambling for the window while the PFY slips the keys down on the desk next to the Boss' wallet... \nWhich I yank the cash out of and slip into the Helldesk geek's jacket pocket. \nYou see a chance, you take it! \n\"So ANYWAY,\" I continue, ad libbing. \"About that Internet porn thing - I think you might want to revise your story somewhat - now that we have credit card information.

There was simply insufficient money to reward all workers, so the board decided to allocate the money evenly and fairly among themselves and the managers who'd achieved the savings over the past year.\" \n\"They awarded themselves a negative bonus? Well, I have to admit it's probably more fair than they ever imagined, but why talk to us - why not talk to the salaries people?\" \n\"They've tried reversing it, but the program won't let them change an annual bonus after it's been paid!\" \n\"Yes, well, I can understand why it won't let them do it, but why are you talking to us?\" \n\"We've got to reverse it! Now! People's bloody mortgages are at risk!\" \n\"Sorry, there's no way I'm doing that - it's embezzlement!\" \n\"It's OK, I'll take responsibility - but it has to be done!\" \n\"I'll need that in writing!\" \n\"Give me a piece of paper!\" >scratch< \"AUTHORITY TO\" >scratchey scratch< \"Reverse transactions and amounts as\" >scratchy< \"of now. THERE!\" \nI grab the hunk of paper and wander over to my desk. \n\"It'll take, oh, about an hour for me to find all the bonus people, do the reversals and get it updated to the bank. And I'll need someone from Salaries to OK it with the bank...\" \n\"I'll get them to do it immediately!\" \n. . . ONE HOUR LATER . . . \n\"WHAT THE BLOODY HELL HAVE YOU DONE!?\" the Boss screams, ricocheting off the door to Mission Control as he bursts into the room \"You've just bloody taken the money out again!\" he sobs. \n\"Yes - that's what you said.\" \n\"WHAT?!?\" \n\"You said reverse the transactions and the amounts. So if we reverse the transaction we'd be taking a negative amount out of their account, and if we reverse the amount, it would then be a positive amount, so we took a positive amount out of their accounts. Like you said. See, it's on this piece of paper that you sign...\" \n>Grasp!<<\/p> \n\"What\" >chew< >chew< \"piece of paper?\" >chew< the Boss asks, swallowing the evidence. \n\"Oh, actually my mistake, that was my lunch expense claim that I'd left on my desk to dry out after I dropped it in the urinal...\" \n>GAG!<<\/p> \n\"HERE's the bit of pape...\" \n>Grasp!<<\/p> \n>chew< \"I didn't \" >chew< \"sign anything.\" \n\"Actually, that's not it either, it was a white piece of paper wasn't it?\" \nThe boss starts stuffing paper down his gob like an industrial shredder, which isn't the way you want your superiors to see you when they're coming to find out where all their money's disappeared to... \n\"You've got to hide me!\" he gasps, ducking under the desk. \"They'll bloody murder me if they seem me!\" \n\"Why? Surely you're just as affected as they are?\" \n\"Yes, but the bonus changes were my idea...\" \n\"Ah, I can see how that would make you a wanted man. Tell you what, hide under the PFY's desk for now.\" \n>Crash!<<\/p> \n\"Where is he?\" the Head of IT snaps, not at all in a good mood. \n\"Who?\" \n\"Your bloody boss!\" one of the other managers snarls. \n\"No idea. Last I heard he was doing some bonus stuff.\" \n\"Find him!\" \n\"Well I'd like to, but I'm still looking into this bonus thing. It seems that the money's just... disappeared. No wait! It looks like the first lot's been transferred, in much smaller amounts, into the non-management people's accounts!\" \n\"And the second lot?\" \n\"Gone!\" the PFY responds faking horror whilst simultaneously clicking through first class air travel prices. \n\"Reverse it!\" \n\"Yeah, I COULD, but I don't think you want to do that - we've already reversed it once, and that didn't work out too well. You MIGHT end up losing another bonus from your account...\" \n. . . The next day, down at the local . . . \n\"mmmmmfffffffffffgguggle,\" the PFY says, which isn't surprising, considering he's been drinking free pints (courtesy of bonus-enriched staff) for the past three hours. \n\"ggggggg,\" I respond, sliding off the table and onto the floor. \nAhhhh, Christmas... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

Late one evening, in a darkened corner of Mission Control . . . \n\"...and so we agreed that for justice, we'd have to talk to the Operators,\" a helldesk geek gushes to me. \n\"Why did you go to the Head of IT? Why didn't you talk to me first?\" I whisper, sitting back in my padded leather wheely chair. \n\"What do you want? Just tell us - anything, but do what we ask, please!\" the geek burbles. \n\"What would you have me do?\" \nThe helldesk geek looks around, spots the PFY, decides that this is best kept between us and whispers his group's request. \nSigh... \n\"That, I cannot do.\" \n\"We'll do anything you ask!\" he blurts. \n\"We've worked in the same place many years, but this is the first time you've ever asked me for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me to your table at the pub for a cold lager. But let's be frank here, you never wanted my friendship, and you're afraid to be in my debt.\" \n\"We... didn't want to get into trouble.\" \n\"I understand. You thought this was a great job. You did nothing, knew nothing, got paid well, and paid your union fees. You didn't need a friend like me... But now you come to me and say, 'Simon, give me justice.' But you don't ask with respect, you don't offer friendship, you don't even call me 'Sir'. Instead you came to Mission Control on the day I'm falsifying my overtime and ask me to accidentally push someone down a comms riser...\" \n\"We're asking you for justice!\" \n\"That isn't justice - you'll still have a desktop machine!\" \nIt'll be a thin client! We won't even be able to play music! \n\"We'll pay!\" he adds, after a conspiratorial pause. \n\"Why do you treat me so disrespectfully? If you came to me in friendship, your department head and the desktop efficiency consultant would be suffering this very afternoon - at the latest. And if by chance an IT 'professional' like yourself lost their desktop machine, then they would in turn have problems with their desktop machines, and they'd think twice about trying to downgrade you.\" \n. . . \n\"Be my friend... uh... er... Sir.\" \nSigh... \n\"Good. Some day, and that day may never come - but it probably will - I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this justice as a token of our friendship.\" \n. . . The next day . . . \n\"Has anyone seen that consultant bloke?\" the Head of IT asks. \n\"The bloke you got in to tell you that thin clients were a good idea, even though the rest of the department, including the Head of IT, thinks they're crap?\" \n\"Uh, yes.\" \n\"No, why?\" \n\"I was supposed to have a meeting with him half an hour ago. We rang his office, but they say he's been on site since this morning. We found his briefcase at reception and the only thing inside it was some rolled up newspaper with a piece of battered fish in it.\" \n\"It's an operational message,\" the PFY murmurs. \"It means he sleeps at the chippy.\" \n\"You mean he's... dead?\" the Boss gasps, knowing that consultants - particularly ones employed by management to back up their ludicrous schemes - are generally an endangered species. \n\"No, it means he's gone to the chippy. We had beers over lunch and sent him for food.\" \n\"You took him out for drinks?\" \n\"Oh yes. Keep your friends close, but independent consultants closer.\" \n\"Well where is he now?\" \n\"No idea. Maybe he's revising his recommendations to suggest that we don't use thin clients as they're a bad long-term investment?\" \n\"He's changed his mind? He said it was a good idea! I'VE JUST ORDERED 200 UNITS! Why the hell did he change his mind?!\" \n\"We made him an offer he couldn't refuse.\" \n\"You threatened him?!\" \n\"No, no. I found a dealer who could undercut the thin client price. Dirt cheap.\" \n\"Well he can't change his mind now - it's too late!\" \n\"Oh, so he gave you a copy of his report?\" \n\"Verbally, yes.\" \n\"Ah, not written. So to the casual upper management observer it might look like you'd committed to a purchase which would fly in the face of the recommendations of an independent consultant?\" \n\"I... ah...\" \n\"And as you're the person who recommended this hardware in the first place, it might look like there was some oversight in the purchase procedure. You've no prior relationship with the vendor in question?\" \n\"Of course not!\" \n\"Never received any gifts?\" \n\"No!\" \n\"Nothing at all?\" \n\"Well, maybe a pen or two, a couple of outings on the company boat.\" \n\"Ooooooh... Conflict of Interest!\" the PFY cries. \n\"I hardly think a bloody pen and some fishing trips would be a conflict of interest!\" \n\"Oh, so you declared it to the Head of IT at the time?\" \n\"No, but...\" \n\"Ooooooh... Undisclosed conflict of interest!\" the PFY chirps. \n\"It's only a bloody PEN and a couple of social events!\" \n\"I'm sure it will come as a great consolation to the company that you sold them out for such a small amount...\" \n\"I...\" the Boss burbles, before rushing out to cover his tracks and try and cancel an order. \n>slam<<\/p> \n\"So ends Operation Fredo?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Uuuuuhhhmmmmm...

Oh, and they're too big to get out of the doorway.\" \n\"Well how the hell did they get in here then?\" \n\"They were built into the room once the floor had been reinforced, apparently.\" \n\"We could widen the doorways to get them out. AND we could put them in the basement - which wouldn't need reinforcing, has HEAPs of spare room, and would free up a room!\" he gasps. \n\"I don't think that's such a good idea - there's no access except via this room, and that would mean a secur--\" \n\"Nonsense! We could whack a door through the other side - or just rebuild this doorway after the tape safes are gone. It's perfectly secure! And with the tape safes gone we could relocate the whole helpdesk there.\" \n!!! \n\"Ah I REALLY don't thi--\" \n\"No, my mind's made up! We'll use that room. I take it you can organise someone to move the tape safes to the basement?\" \nNggggggragh! \nNow I'm no elitist - well, actually I am, but that's beside the point - but I do NOT want to spend my life being bothered by the helldesk with every one of their inane enquiries every minute of the day. There is no way it can be allowed to happen. \n. . . \nI get into the office after lunch and find out that there's no stopping the Boss. A large gaping hole greets us from where the tape safe room door used to be, courtesy of one of the building cowboys the company use for minor alterations. \nI know it's them by the jagged approximation of a rectangle which has been circular sawed into the wall - halfway through the light switch on the other side of the wall. Professional! \nScant minutes later, a wadge of fatblokes from the safe moving company arrive, and begin hoisting the safe onto their heavy duty creeper... \n...which, once they get into Mission Control, puts it's castor wheels through the floorboards. \n\"Not to worry!\" one of the fatblokes chirps. \"We'll put steel plates under it till we get it to the frieght elevator.\" \nDesperate times, desperate measures. I give the PFY some instructions, then leave to supervise the tape safe's installation - knowing only too well that it'll end up with its door facing the wall. \n\"Bloody heavy, this,\" one of the fatblokes says, making polite conversation while waiting for the freight lift. \"What's in it, plumbing supplies?\" \n\"No idea.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well when I got here I found that there keys for all the tape safes but that one, so we've never used it. The only reason we've kept it is because it's too bloody difficult to move.\" \n\"So it's you're lucky day then?\" he burbles. \n\"About to be, yes!\" \n>ding<<\/p> \nI give the fatblokes a hand pushing as the doors open, and even - out of the goodness of my heart - grab one to help him keep his balance as the safe topples down the lift shaft \n>CRASH<<\/p> \n\"BUGGER ME!\" the fatbloke shouts. \"Where's the bloody lift?\" \n\"Ah, here it comes now\" I mention, pulling him back from the open doorway as the empty lift sails past. \"Mind your head! Yes, the freight elevator's a bit of a death trap, so it's probably lucky that we weren't in it.\" \nI hear a much smaller >CRASH< from below as the remote controlled lift fails to get to B2, due to the newly installed shaft obstruction. The PFY, bless him, isn't one to be put off and continues to attempt with repeated crashes echoing up the shaft while I put up the hazard tape like a good safety conscious employee. \nA much nearer crash occur minutes later as the Boss rolls in looking rather red. \n\"SKIP THE BLOODY EXCUSES!\" he blurts. \"I KNOW IT WAS YOU WHO SABOTAGED THE LIFT, AND I'M GETTING THE LIFT COMPANY IN TO PROVE IT! AND IF YOU THINK THAT THIS WILL DO ANYTHING BUT DELAY THE HELPDESK MOVE, YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER TH-- WAOOOOH!\" >CRASH!< >BZZZZZERT<<\/p> \n\"BUGGER ME!\" the head fatbloke says as the boss trips on one of the holes in the floor and falls into the gutted lightswitch. \"This place is a bloody deathtrap!\" \n\"It is if it's managed properly, yes, but that was a complete accident,\" I'm forced to admit. \"Beautifully executed though. Any of you blokes know mouth-to-mouth.\" \n\"I do!\" one of the more generous fatblokes says. \n\"Can you give it a crack once I pop the breaker?\" I ask prying open the distribution board. \n\"Sure.\" \nSome days everything just goes like clockwork. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.

I know it's loneliness because he hasn't brought the wadge of paper he generally carries with him to remind him of what he came for. \n\"Just... ah... checking to see how things are going at... er... Mission Control. As it were...\" he says, gesturing expansively about the room. \n\"Fine,\" I respond, \"business as usual.\" \n\"And your assistant?\" he asks as he sits in the PFY's vacant chair. \n\"Oh, he's out and about getti--\" \n\"My, these are nice chairs!\" he sighs, getting comfortable, just as the PFY arrives. \n\"Yes, they're the new Ergo 3000s,\" the PFY comments. \"Full lumbar, thoracic and cervical support, built-in infrared linked multimedia speakers in the headpiece, servo-assisted adjustment, and full recline. This model even has the servo interface to your desktop to allow it tilt, roll and rise in response to computer control. They market it as the ulimate in gaming chairs, but we needed them because... uhhhhhm... BECAUSE they could proactively put you into micropause position!\" he adlibs. \"Do you mind?\" \n\"No, not at all, don't want to interrupt your work! So where did they come from?\" he asks. \"Might grab myself one!\" \n\"Dunno who the vendor is, but the secretary's got the catalogue in her admin folder,\" I respond, to the boss' departing back. \n. . . Two minutes later . . . \n\"THEY'RE BLOODY 2500 QUID EACH!\" the boss gasps \"They're REAL LEATHER! You used the WHOLE of last year's furniture and fittings budget on a couple of chairs!\" \n\"Well technically, we used the whole of last year's and the whole of this years as well,\" the PFY corrects. \"For the chairs we use at home.\" \n\"YOU BOUGHT CHAIRS FOR HOME!?!\" \n\"Of course! Wouldn't want to put my back in jeopardy by working remotely on a substandard item - that could cost you a stack in health penalties. It makes financial sense, because if we had to come in to work to use a proper chair to reboot a server - with a three-hour minimum call-out, overtime, plus travel expenses - it'd only take about five call-outs and the chairs would be paid for.\" \n\"But you've used the entire furniture and fittings budget. What happens if someone else's chair breaks?\" \n\"Get it fixed under the maintenance budget?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"I'd use the training budget myself,\" I suggest. \"And justify it by buying an ergonomic chair and saying that you're 'training' their posture.\" \n\"No, say it's a Health and Safety item!\" the PFY cries. \"That's centrally funded and there's always a stack of Health and Saftey money for that sort of thing.\" \n\"There's no Health and Safety budget left this year, I checked - Sharon says that the money all went into building electrical safety after some incidents last year.\" \n\"Oh right - before your time,\" I concur. \"Nasty business. Had to buy a huge box of warning labels to put on most of the building's powerpoints to indicate electricity is harmful and that it's dangerous to put foreign objects into them.\" \n\"What, people put all those things into power sockets?\" \n\"Hard to believe, isn't it? Some even said that we'd TOLD them to do it!\" \n\"Did you?\" \n\"Of course not. They were just in shock - jumbles the mind, you know.\" \n\"So anyway, there's not enough budget for another chair,\" the Boss says, getting back to his favourite topic, himself. \n\"Yes, we know,\" I add. \"We wanted one for the Computer Room Console desk, but the cupboard was bare. Still, can't you use the Management Innovation Budget?\" \n\"Hmm?\" \n\"The MIB - it's the slush fund for Company Managers to invest in 'Innovative' technology.\" \n\"I hardly think a chair counts as innovative.\" \n\"Neither's a GIS unit for your private car, but the Head of IT got one last week!\" the PFY notes. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because it's a slush fund - they're always tapped out within weeks of the New Year by people wanting new gadgets!\" \n\"What was the model number again?\" the Boss burbles quickly, penny dropping. \nI write the model number down, adding an \"X 2\" to the bottom of the page. \n\"Times TWO?!?\" the Boss asks. \n\"You don't want to put yourself at risk when working from home now, do you?\" \n\"I don't work from home. I haven't got a machine there.\" \n\"And you've never taken a work-related phone call?\" \n\"Well, a couple of times...\" \n\"And you sit down sometimes when you're on the phone?\" \n\"Wellll, it's possible...\" \n\"There you go then!\" \nTwo days later, I notice the TWO chairs arrive in their spanky new plastic wrapping, and wait at my desk for the inevitable phone call. \n> Ring, Ring <<\/p> \nTold you so. \n\"How do you hook these things up again?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Plug the chair into the charger for four hours...\" I sigh. \"The interface is infrared, so no wires needed after that.\" \nAnd what do I do with the coiled wire? \n\"The coiled wire?\" \n\"A long green curly wire connected to the arm rests. It says it's an... uh... 'antistatic safety earthing flylead'.\" \nI cast a quick glance at my chair and notice the lead in question still in it's plastic bag, taped under the armrest. Woopsy. \n\"Just plug it into the earth pin of any power point.\" \n\"And which one's the earth pin?\" \n\"Uh...\" I say, thinking of how a good console chair would be good. And two, even better... \n. . . \n\"Any of those warning labels left?\" I ask the PFY minutes later, as a high pitched scream punctuates the building... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2004, Simon Travaglia.

I... I'm not sure I'm up to work today,\" the PFY sighs sadly, staring vacantly in restrained grief. \n\"Oh for Pete's sake, pull yourself together, man!\" the Boss snaps. \"We can get past this!\" \n\"I don't think we can...\" \n\"Course we can. It'll be difficult for a while, but you'll get back into the swing of things. Think of the doors that are now open for you to explore new things!\" \n\"I don't want to explore new things!\" the PFY sniffs. \"Why couldn't you have been more careful?\" \n\"It was an accident,\" the Boss confesses, \"a tragic accident. The sooner we put it behind us and move on, things will stand a chance of getting back to normal!\" \n\"It won't be the same,\" the PFY sniffles. \"It'll never be the same. It's all ruined now.

Three hours later . . . \n\"TWO THOUSAND QUID!\" the Boss gasps. \"That's ridiculous. You could buy a new machine for that!\" \n\"Not a high volume one like this,\" the coffee bloke replies. \"That's a work of art. Apart from the stuffed pump, dodgy pressure switch and half blocked lines that is.\" \n\"I haven't got budget for that!\" the Boss blurts. \n\"Sure you do. It's a small price to pay for a happy energetic workers,\" I chip in. \n\"You can switch to instant like the rest of them!\" \nEven the coffee bloke is stunned by the blasphemy. \n\"I'm NOT paying 2000 quid to get a coffee machine fixed!\" the Boss repeats. \n\"He's right in a way,\" the coffee bloke adds unhelpfully. \"Most big machines like this are treated well and last forever - well, outside of accidents. But I could line you up with a single group one for about 500.\" \n\"A home model?\" I snap \"That's not even plumbed in! I'd rather use a plunger! What's a new one of these worth?\" \n\"These babies?\" the coffee bloke replies, as the car salesman in him takes over. \"Anything from four to ten kay, depending on the features you want with them. You can get them with computers in now.\" \n\"Really?\" the PFY asks, interested. \n\"Yeah, for those cafes where the waiters use portable computers to take your order. They tap the info in by the time they get to the counter the coffee's ground, poured and ready!\" \n\"I'm not buying one!\" the Boss says firmly. \n\"Could we buy a base model and upgrade?\" the PFY asks. \n\"The computer-controlled model is built on the mid-level three group unit,\" the coffee bloke chirps, \"which is around six kay. The extras are relay controlled valves, conveyor and interface computer.\" \n\"So if we built our own interface and just got the valves and conveyor off you...\" \n\"It'd cost around seven and a half.\" \n\"With trade in?\" I ask. \n\"Well... it's a bit of a dinosaur, isn't it?\" \n\"Dinosaur? You just said it was a work of art!\" \n\"Yeah, and like most works of art it's old. Seven kay, and I'm doing you a favour!\" \n\"Done!\" I blurt. \n\"I'm not paying seven grand for a coffee machine!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"No, I will. And I'll give the company a grand for the old one!\" \n\"Done!\" the Boss chortles. \n\"But it's only worth 500 as a trade-in!\" the PFY snaps. \n\"Yeah, but I'll buy it under my private company, depreciate it at 30 per cent, then claim it's stuffed, claim tax back on it as a loss, buy the new one, claim THAT as a business expense, get you to whack the computer control on it, build a web front end and charge the hordes a quid a time for coffee which they can order from their desktop and collect from the machine.\" \nI scratch out a cheque and hand it over to the Boss, who takes but a moment to scratch out a receipt before dashing off to get the cheque banked before I can cancel it. \n\"You're going to do all that?\" \n\"The web coffee thing?

Once that's complete it's then my job to advise the interview committee that the prospective candidate has all the technical acumen of a sack of spanners. Which they then ignore by appointing the person anyway. \nIt's company policy. \n\"It's a bloody helldesk position!\" I blurt, when the Boss tells me that we're up for another set of interviews. \"It's not like their experience is going to make a difference!\" \n\"Course it does!\" the Helldesk Coordinator argues. \"We need someone with experience of the software that our users have - so that problems are resolved in good time!\" \n\"The only skill a Helldesk person needs is the ability to spot idiots!\" I respond. \"The rest is just tat you can pick up from the other Helldesk people. You know, like how many times you have to rapidly toggle the powersupply switch to open the secret Intel BIOS Easter Egg.\" \n\"What secret Intel BIOS Easter Egg?\" the Helldesk Coordinator asks. \nThe fact that there's NO secret powersupply-toggle-activated Intel BIOS easter egg, never was, and never will be only serves to illustrate my key point about the ability to recognise idiots. They come in all shapes and sizes, and are represented at all levels of the IT foodchain. \n\"Nothing,\" I reply, faking sincerity badly to ensure at least one loud bang in the department before day's end. \n\"Well we still need some questions to help us determine his level of expertise, what extra skills he might have, and what sort of offer we make to him,\" the Boss comments. \n\"His, Him?\" I ask, PC-ly \n\"Uh, Him or Her,\" the Boss responds quickly. \nI make a mental note to accidentally mention this incident to one of the more rampant windup toys at HR for a bit of at-work entertainment later in the week... \n. . . \n\"So you're wanting something like 'Can you name and explain the FSMO roles in a Windows 2000 Domain Controller?'\" I ask later while we're waiting for the first victim to show. \n\"Pardon?\" the Boss asks, while the Helldesk Coordinator looks on blankly. \n\"FSMO roles. In a Domain Controller.\" \n\"Ahh.. I was thinking about something a little, well, more user orientated.\" \n\"Without FSMO roles, we'd have no users!\" \n\"Something a user would ask about!\" the Helldesk Coordinator snaps. \n\"Oh you mean like 'What happened to all my files?', 'When are you going to let me out of this tape safe?', or 'Did you just break the key off in the lock?'\" \n\"NO! I mean questions like 'A user is not able to login. What would you look at first?'\" \n\"Ah!\" \n\"But more open ended,\" the Boss comments, \"like 'Can you give me an example of..' questions.\" \n\"Of course!\" I blurt. \"I think I've got the hang of it. Send in the accused!\" \n. . . \n\"Can you give me an example of...\" I ask, watching the Boss and Helldesk Coordinator brace themselves, \"..causes of login failure.\" \n\"Caps Lock down,\" the candidate replies knowledgably. \"Wrong Password, the User's been disabled, they're not logging into the right domain...\" \n. . Several Interviews later . . \n\"Well,\" the Boss burbles. \"They all seem to be of the same level to me.\" \n\"Yes,\" I respond. \"Reasonably experienced too, which makes a change. They're all so similar it's going to be a hard choice.\" \n\"Perhaps not - One more to go,\" the Boss burbles. \"Ah..uuum I don't seem to have a name on my pad?\" \n\"Late applicant,\" the Helldesk Coordinator responds. \"HR emailled me the CV earlier this morning. He seemed the cream of the crop, loads of experience!\" \n\"I'll get him in then,\" I say, noticing the name and wandering over to the door. \n. . . \n\"Hello,\" the PFY says, sitting down in the candidate's chair. \n\"Is this some sort of joke?\" the Boss asks. \n\"What?\" the PFY asks. \n\"You've already got a job here!\" \n\"Yes, but I was thinking of downskilling. And there's a lot of things about the helpdesk that appeal to me.\" \n\"Like what?\" the Helldesk coordinator asks. \n\"The ability to sleep on the job, for one. And, I was thinking that I could just record the words 'Have you rebooted your machine?' and put them into an answerphone on my desk to increase resolution times.\" \n\"I think you'll find there's a lot more to a Helpdesk role than that!\" \n\"Yes, drinking coffee and looking at porn, true, but I thought I'd just start off slowly and work my into the advanced career options over time...\" \n\"I think this interview is over,\" the Boss snaps. \n. . . \n\"So, how do we decide?\" the Boss asks when we reconvene later. \n\"Well, I took the liberty of phoning the applicants and asking them another 'Can you give an example' question, and one candidate stands out head and shoulders above the rest. Number 3, uuuum... Mr Watters.\" \n\"Really. You're that impressed with his answer?\" \n\"Oh yes, his answer was a lot more than I'd expected and I think he's the man for the job. Told him so in fact!\" \n\"Oh well, I suppose it works out. Ah.. What was the question?\" \n\"Can you give an example of a situation where you bribed an interview panel to get a position?\" \n\"Ah.\" ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2004, Simon Travaglia.

Still, it looks nice in the beginning (before installation rot sets in) and that's when you grab the snapshots that you use in your publicity for years to come. \nThe Boss, the PFY and I rock on up at the appointed time and wait patiently at reception for the arrival of our host. The PFY takes this opportunity to excuse himself for a rest stop, returning with the slightly greasy hands that indicate a successful major engine timing rejig. \nSorted. Now just to put up with the condescending hour-long monologue... I know I'm not too far off in my expectations when a charcoal-suited bloke strolls over and introduces himself as Karl, the \"Installation guru\" , noting his pride and joy - a monitor at reception showing the computer room in all its glory. I mentally prepare myself for the onslaught of smugness, the trauma of which will hopefully be alleviated by the presence of a couple of attractive female reporters who've also signed up for the tour... \n. . Two hours of Powerpoint Presentations about how his installation is much better than everyone in the whole world's... \n\"And here we have our Comms room,\" he burbles, gesturing through a viewing window at a clean new room. \"As you can see, full patch by exception frames, Cat 6 cabling in structured cabling retaining systems, linked to dual redundant comms rooms at either end of each floor via twin redundant fibre in purpose-built risers completely isolated from other installation ducting. Full fire protection throughout, external and internal UPS systems, raised floor and full length armoured observation window allowing monitoring from the Control room. And here's the computer room. As you can see, it too has a fully armoured observation window - with redundant aircon, UPS, Fire systems. Obviously we'll fit the glass with a one way film once we commission the room - after the big party tomorrow.\" \n\"Party?\" I ask, smelling free drinks, food and the chance to annoy politicians. \n\"Yes, for the opening. The new technology minister, a couple of MPs, some drinks - more of a photo op than anything else,\" he says, playing it down. \"Right, we'll just pop through to the room so you can see some state-of-the-art installation techniques which I think you'll find surprising. Just have to swipe myself through - if you don't mind looking away.\" \n\"Not at all!\" I burble, turning my back on the door while he swipes his card and types in enough numbers to program the Mars probe in binary. \nWe traipse into the computer room, and I have to admit that it is impressive. \n\"See these?\" Karl says. \"Quick-release sliding rack systems to enable rapid removal for maintenance. Fits all major vendor's equipment. Each rack unit has its own microprocessor controlled reactive venting to eliminate hotspots and power monitoring to indicate equipment which deviates from its normal consumption ... Yes?\" \n\"Just need to pop off to the gents,\" the PFY murmurs. \"Dicky bladder at the mo...\" \n\"Right, press the red release button and it's the door over there,\" Karl responds, indicating a room off the Control Room through the glass. \n\"You have a toilet off the control room?\" I ask. \n\"Oh yes. The Computing core is designed to be completely secure and self sustaining for 48 hours. We even have our own kitchen and everything - although the fridges are, at the moment, stocked with the drinks and nibbles for tomorrow.\" \n\"Why self sustaining?\" one of the reporters asks. \n\"Terrorists,\" Karl responds. \"This site will be doing some of the top level information processing for various government agencies, and as such might present a target. Anything untoward happens, the operational staff hit any of the emergency buttons in the control area and the three rooms are time-locked from each other and the rest of the building for 48 hours.\" \n\"Or until someone breaks through the walls or floors, or takes a hostage to make you open the door...\" \n\"No,\" Karl burbles happily. \"The Computing core is surrounded by three feet of vault-strength concrete, each room isolated from the other by armour glass and one foot of concrete. Emergency doors are three quadlayer isolation slides which lock into place, making the place impenetrable! AND you can't take a hostage to force someone to open the doors because all the phones are disconnected. Security has been the watchword for this installation!\" \n\"It certainly seems that way,\" I say, as we make our way back into the control area, to the assenting voices of the reporters. \"Is that a rat?!\" I gasp pointing to the bottom of a rack in the computer room. \n\"It shouldn't be!\" Karl gasps, worriedly typing the binary bible into the swipe card reader and rushing back with the Boss in tow. \"We have traps in all the ducting!\" . . . . \"No, nothing here,\" he chirps into the intercom after he and the Boss have a good look about. \"Must have been your imagination!\" \n\"Must've been,\" I agree as they wander back to the control room. \"Don't worry, I'll get the doo...\" \n\"NOT THAT BUTTON!\" Karl screams just as a large armoured door slams shut, appearing from somewhere in the ceiling. \n\"Woopsy!\" I gasp, looking through the observation window at the Boss and Karl's frantic attempts to cancel the lockdown. \"How do I reverse it?\" \n\"You can't reverse it!\" Karl snaps angrily, \"I told you!\" \n\"Damn it!\" the PFY snaps, not very convincingly, on his way to the kitchen. \n\"What'll we do?\" one of the reporters asks unhappily. \n\"There's no need to panic,\" I respond, taking control. \"I've been in situations like this before, and know that panic does not help!\" \n\"Really?\" the other reporter gasps. \n\"Not at all,\" the PFY replies, coming back from the fridge with laden arms. \"Alcohol, on the other hand >ffsssss POP!< does. Anyone care for a glass of Champaine and ... errrm ... a canape of some sort?\" \n\"That's for the opening!\" Karl shouts through the intercom. \n\"Surely you don't expect us to starve or dehydrate?\" I respond, tipping liberal amounts into the glasses of the reporters and the PFY. \n\"What about us?!\" the Boss gasps, obviously feeling a little peckish. \n\"Well it doesn't look good. As far as I can see there's only one waterproof container in the room - which will have to suffice for both your ablutary and culinary needs for the next two days.\" \n\"MMmmmMMMM tasty!\" the PFY adds turning back to the women brandishing another Moet & Chandon bottle. \"Top you up?\" \n\"Bit of a mistake that locking system,\" the PFY comments. \n\"I'd be more worried about that camera in the foyer when the thirst sets in,\" I add. \"I wonder if they're taping it?\" \n\"Could we get them a message?\" the PFY asks evilly. \n\"Doesn't look like it,\" I sigh. \nNasty business these lock-ins. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2004, Simon Travaglia.

Now I don't think you want to be doing that...\" I murmur, watching the Boss authoring an online Client Survey form for the masses about things that don't matter. (i.e. their expectations, How they'd like us to deliver them, etc.) \n\"Really?\" he asks \"Why's that?\" \n\"It doesn't pay to ask questions! We already know what people want - everything, yesterday. AND we know that they're used to disappointment. But if you start asking them what they think we should be doing, you'll just ignite a spark of hope\" \n\"A spark is a good thing!\" \n\"Not when I stamp that spark out with the cold hard boot of reality.\" \n\"What?! Why? I happen to think that some of the staff may have something valuable to contribute!\" \n\"To the lengthening unemployment queues, yes. But you don't want them mixing stupidity with technology. That's your job. Leave it to them and they'll be recommending that we upgrade to those 'new' voice-operated computers they saw on Bladerunner... ... Oh, and you definitely don't want to be asking for any additional comments they might have about IT, the department, or our ongoing strategy.\" \n\"Why not!?\" \n\"Because it's a drift net for stupid ideas. Sure, you'll get one or two people who actually give a sane suggestion, but then you'll hit all the dolphins - the people who, because they've been asked to contribute feel that they have to contribute - like it's an intelligence test or something. Only they've got nothing useful to contribute, so they start off on some innovative tangent, like if we installed a large plasma screen in reception we could use it to have customised messages of the day for staff and visitors, etc, instead of what it would really be used for\" \n\"Which would be?\" \n\"Security would use it to watch porn movies late at night when everyone's left the building.\" \n\"Oh I doubt that. Though the screen itself sounds like a good idea!\" \n\"They all sound like good ideas...!\" \n\"So what do you suggest?\" \n\"Lets start with basic concepts. Firstly, the only cavassing of users you should be doing is with a heavy tarpaulin, a stack of bricks and a deep stretch of water\" \n\"Huh?\" \nCompletely over his head. Ah well. \n\"... When composing a questionnaire, you tailor the questions so that the answers can be made to support whatever it is you're after - sort of like the way they rig election popularity figures prior to the elections and before they get rigged at the electronic ballot boxes. \" \n\"How do you mean?\" \n\"What, the elections, the questionairres or the ballot boxes?\" \n\"Questionnaires.\" \n\"OK, as a for instance, say you wanted a pay rise.\" \n\"You'd ask if they think that we're paid enough?\" \n\"No! No, if you ask that question, everyone would tick yes, with a few respondents writing 'too much' in the margins. No, instead you ask something open ended like 'Should the company be paying market rates to retain the services of key technical staff?' to which most people will respond yes. Then you go find some IT rag that says that market rates have just risen by 20% in the past year, and pass it to the Head of IT to bring up with personnel..\" \n\"I don't think it's tha..\" \n\"Or maybe you ask the question 'Do you feel that IT doing a good job with the people they have?' with only two answers, Yes and No. All the Yes answers will end up supporting pay rises for the staff, while all the No answers support the requirement for more staff.\" \n\"That's ridiculous!\" \n\"Oh Pulllllleeeeeeze! Say you wanted a larger office. You don't say 'Do we need a larger office?'. You would ask a question like 'Of the two improvements that we have the money to finance this year, which would be of more benefit to the company - buying the a new espresso machine for the IT Administrators, or enlarging technical office space.'\" \n\"And they'd say enlarging offices because they all hate you?\" \n\"No, they'd say enlarging office spaces because they'd think that if they worked it properly they might qualify as 'technical staff' somehow.\" \n\"I see your point. But... No... I don't think I want to do that, it's just sneaky!\" \n\"Of course it is! Look, You tell me the results you want and I'll give you a questionairre that makes it look like the whole building supports it.\" \n\"And what's in it for you - You want to take the PR credit for the questionnaire?\" \n\"No - I'm assuming that anything you improve can only be a knock-on improvement for us. I'll put your name as author if it makes you feel better..\" \n\"Yes, I think that's best. Well I suppose what I'd really like to do is....\" \nHalf an hour of rambling later. . . \n\"OK, Leave it to me!\" \nThree days and one survey later. . . \n\"Fantastic!\" the Boss burbles, looking over the PFY's shoulder as the results are presented \"That question about whether they have confidence in IT Management's ability to deliver service within the constraints of our budget is sure to get us good funding next year.\" \n\"Bound to,\" the PFY responds. \"...unless...\" \n\"Unless what?\" \n\"Well unless - and I'm just suggesting this as a possibility - someone misread the question as an indication of a confidence problem instead of an indication of a budget problem\" . \n\"Well I don't see how tha... oh.\" \n\"Yes, and when you consider that with the question immediately following it 'Do you think that outsourcing IT Staff would improve delivery of services?'\" \n\"And they said No!\" \n\"Yes, which could mean that they're happy with the IT Staff, or it could mean that they think the poor delivery of services is because of IT Management - who should be outsourced.\" \n\"Well I... uh.. Do you think I've been set up?!\" he gasps. \n\"I'd have thought that was obvious in question 23\" \n\"Question 23?!\" \n\"On the second webpage.\" \n\"What second webpage?\" \n\"Ah well. Perhaps you'd like to take a couple of moments to collect your thoughts. And personal belongings. Question 23 was 'Who is the weakest link?' with your name .vs. the old mailroom guy - who's one year off retirement, wife just died, and who franks people's personal mail for free.\" \n\"Well, I...\" \n\"And speaking of mail, Question 27, asking how offended staff would be at you reading their personal emails - that didn't go so well for you..\" \n\"That's slander!\" \n\"It's only slander if the question said you DID it, this just asks how offended they would be IF you did..\" \n\"There'd have to be a good reason for me to read someone's personal email!\" \n\"Toilet paper theft?\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Question 29. Do you think that cameras in the toilets would prevent toilet paper theft?\" \n\"I.. I..\" \n\"Yes, I know, it's all come as a bit of a shock, but that's how it goes around here. We like our bosses to rollover every couple of months or so - you know, so they don't get stagnant. Why don't I make you a nice cup of tea while you wait for the howling mob?\" \n. . . \nTold you it doesn't pay to ask questions. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2004, Simon Travaglia.

No, the company signed up to a sustainability and reduced ecological impact initiative a couple of years back, and this is one of the outcomes!” \n“How?” \n“Simple. For the past two years we’ve been sending our effluent to one of those biodome things as a raw product for their planting system.” \n“We’ve been giving them crap?” the PFY asks. \n“For want of better wording, yes.” \n“So does that mean we’re giving our clients a break?” I ask, rhetorically. \n“AND THE OUTCOME OF THIS,” the Boss continues, ignoring me, “is fruit and veg, free for the taking, in the cafeteria!” \n“So let me get this straight,” I ask “You’ve been giving my excrement away to people.” \n“It’s crap!” the boss responds. \n“It’s MY crap, and I work long and hard choosing the products to eat to make it high yield fertiliser.” \n“It would’ve got sent to the bloody sewer system anyway,” the Boss replies. \n“If I so choose to release my products to the public domain, so be it. However, if you take something which is mine, which I created, and give it to another – well that’s theft!” \n“Yeah, sure,” the Boss snaps wearily. \n“I thought about it, and created it, it’s my intellectual property!” \n“I doubt it!” \n. . . three days later . . . \n“What the hell is this?” the Head of IT snaps, crashing into mission control, waving a piece of paper. \n“A ... piece of paper?” the PFY suggests. \n“Well?” he asks, ignoring the PFY and addressing me directly. \n“I can’t see from here.” \n“It’s a letter from your solicitors, saying they’re going to take legal action against the company – and all the staff in the company who took any of the free fruit and veg earlier in the week!” \n“Oh that!” I said. “Yes, about the company stealing my IP.” \n“They stole your excrement!” he snaps. \n“So you agree they stole it?” I ask. \n“No, I didn’t mean that, I meant it was just ... shit.” \n“It may be shit, but it was incorporated into a better product without my permission.” \n“And so if we don’t…. purchase a licence to your excrement … you’re going to sue us.” \n“Yes.” \n“But we don’t want your excrement – it’s smelly and worthless.” \n“That may be the case, but parts of my excrement made up the fruit and veg you took, without my permission. And as I don’t license components of my excrement, just the excrement, you’d need a license for my excrement to own the fruit and veg.” \n“It’s SHIT!” he snaps. \n“There would be few people in the world who would disagree with you. However, my thought went into its construction, and it’s my intellectual property.” \n“It’s SHIT!” \n“I’m not arguing with you.” \n“OK, how much is the licence?” \n“50 quid.” \n“FIFTY BLOODY QUID!” \n“Yes, now. Course if you wait till after the court case, the price might go up.” \n“That’s extortion!” \n“I’m not going to argue with you about that either.” \n“But what good is an excrement license to me?” \n“Well, should you want to use my excrement for something – in the future – you have a license for it. And you can keep eating the free fruit and veg!” \n“So what PART of your excrement contributed to this carrot?” \n“I’m afraid I’m not at liberty to disclose that.” \n“We’ll I’ll tell the biodome to stop using your crap.” \n“It would mean a complete cleanup, start from scratch, to remove all the vestages of my IP from the ground substrate… Very costly. And it wouldn’t help all you people who still have the fruit and veg.” \n“So let me get this straight – I buy a poo license from you for 50 quid.” \n“At today’s prices, yes.” \n“And you allow me to keep eating free fruit and veg.” \n“Yes.” \n“And if it transpires that you used a toilet that didn’t empty into the storage container, but into the sewer instead would you refund me?” \n“Well no, because you bought a licence to use my poo. Contained in that license is the option to use things made from my poo. But you can still use my poo.” \n“So if there was none of your poo in the biodome, I’d have paid you 50 quid.” \n“At today's prices.” \n“Yes, at today’s prices, for nothing.” \n“No, for the license to use my poo.” \n“Right, well I’m not paying.” \n“Well, I guess I’ll see you in court.” \n. . . \n“Are you really going to take them to court?” \n“Depends on how much money I get outside of court. If I get a lot, I’ve lined up a private investor who’ll buy all the rights and then charge an annual support fee.” \n“If not?” \n“Dunno, I might settle for a couple of pints and a pickled egg at the pub. So, was that a pear you were eating yesterday?” \n“You bastard.” \n“I don’t think Bastard goes anywhere near to describing the unmitigated scum sucking, bottom feeding toerag that is me. But hey – who knew shit could be worth so much…” ® \n"}

Let the plaudits flow, starting with Dan Shadix: \nThat just might be the best thing I've ever read. Truly awesome. \nAnd there's more, from Marcus Giles: \nYou owe me a new keyboard... ;-) \nThat was the funniest piece of work ever.. well done mate.. well done indeed :-D \nThe US loves BOFH too, especially Kevin Curry of Virginia Beach: \nI just linked to your article through a Slashdot user comment. \"Protecting bodily waste in the public domain\" is brilliant! \nAnd now that I've clicked your email link and see that you are a New Zealander, I love your work even more. :^) \nWhat that means is anyone's guess. Of course, there's more to the latest BOFH than meets the eye. That, at least is according to Jos Osborne: \n<Round of applause> \nNever have I seen the Litigious Bastards situation so well put. \nI congratulate you sir. \nLitigious Bastards? What's that all about? Let's ask Jeff Asselin: \nNice jab at SCO. It's a shame most people won't even get the point, but well. \nJeff, you'd be surprised how many people did get the point, or at least as they saw it. Tim Bowden demonstrates: \nI like to read the BOFH's on el reg as they are amusing, but this one had me ROFL. It has SCO down to a T. \nSam Christie also thought he had the point, and was prepared to be a little more explicit: \nPure brilliance. BOFH #8 is simply genius. You got off calling SCO an \"unmitigated scum sucking, bottom feeding toerag\" . I wish all media outlets had the balls to do that. Keep up the good work! \nThose readers who are none the wiser should look no further than recent Reg articles on the massive SCO IP punch-up which has seen the software company file law suits against various outfits, DaimlerChrysler included. This particular suit primarily revolves around SCO's accusations that the company put bits of Unix Systems V code into Linux, thereby gang raping its intellectual property. You get the idea. \nHowever, in this case, BOFH fans are seriously misguided. Simon Travaglia has asked us to point out that BOFH is an entirely fictitious character and - in the tradition of the best TV disclaimers - that any resemblance to any individual company, living or dead, is purely coincidental. \nRight, that's our arses covered. Let's end with the one lone criticism of this particular episode, courtesy of Fazal Majid: \nShit is worth far more than 50 quid, 550 pounds per tin, as a matter of fact: www.telegraph.co.uk www.miami.com \nDuly noted. ® \n"}

The case is fairly open and shut in that the staff consumed food grown with the aid of my excrement, which was in turn used without my knowledge or approval. \nAs I later revealed, my excrement is the 'fruit' of considerable intellectual effort, both in the selection of food of varying types, and the amount of lager to accompany it so as to reach it's full nutrient potential. \nAs expected, the weaker staff caved in almost immediately to my threats of legal action and bought licenses to use my excrement. The rest of them though, are waiting to see how things go, so it seems a couple of examples need to be made... \n...a day later, the Boss and the PFY aren't happy. \n\"But I paid my license fee in pints!\" the PFY snaps, annoyed, whilst scanning the content of my lawyer's letter. \n\"If that were true, you'd have a license certificate, surely.\" \n\"What, you actually printed license certificates for the use of your excrement?!\" the Boss asks. \n\"Of course! What sort of vendor would I be if I didn't issue license certificates?\" \n\"I paid!\" the PFY snaps. \n\"Alright, have a license document,\" I say, handing over a tastefully printed document headed with a three letter acronym recognised in the computing community as being synonymous with excrement. \n\"You can't prove that I had any of the fruit or veg that has your IP in it!\" the Boss blurts, placing his summons on my desk. \n\"You may be right,\" I say, \"but I'm sure that a quick subpoena would sort everything out.\" \n\"Subpoena?\" he asks. \"What for?\" \n\"Just a sample of your DNA - to prove that you now contain some of my IP.\" \n\"It won't show anything!\" \n\"Oh, don't worry, I'd subpoena your tissue again if the first test was inconclusive.\" \n\"And keep on doing it until you find something I suppose?\" \n\"Oh no. No, we only get two cracks at it - unless you've got three testicles\" \n\"WHAT!\" \n\"Yes, Well you realise that if you've absorbed my IP, any children you have would have to be licensed, and of course the only way I can prove absorption would be through your reproductive organs.\" \n\"That's preposterous!\" \n\"I have the documented opinion of a couple of medical experts.\" \n\"You bribed them!\" \n\"No,\" I lie. \"If I'd bribed them, they'd say that they needed both your testicles to start with, and if any IP were found you'd need to be subjected to six months of female hormones to cleanse your system. Hmm, I might just make a quick phone call....\" \n\"Do you take cheques?\" the Boss asks, snapping like a twig. \n\"Of course. Made out to 'BIP PLC'.\" \n. . . \nAs with all good plans, the PFY is there to throw a spanner in the works... \n\"Course...\" he says, once the Boss has left, \"I'd need my share.\" \n\"Of what?\" \n\"Your IP - for my unpaid consultancy.\" \n\"When?\" \n\"When I diagnosed the non-solid portions of your IP.\" \n\"?!\" \n\"My opinion on your flatulence. Beta testing if you like. You altered your food intake in response to my diagnosis. Therefore not all the development credit is yours.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And so you owe me credit for what you call 'your' IP.\" \n\"?\" \n\"Your product was modified in response to the feedback I gave you! Say I'd licensed some software off you, it was complete and utter crap - the stuff that all your clients couldn't WAIT to be shot of when something - ANYTHING - better came along. For instance. Hypothetically. Now because it's so crap, I'd be placing service calls to you to report the faults in your product, which would, in turn, cause you to alter your product in some way. In effect if you've actually modified your code in response to my service call, which means I'm helping to shape your product with my diagnosis. Now unless you had a contract with me that expressly stated that any problems I logged with you would become the property of your company, I would in fact be owed some compensation for helping to develop your software.\" \n\"So you're saying that by pointing out how smelly I am, you deserve a share of my product license fees for helping to develop it?\" \n\"That's what my lawyer tells me,\" the PFY says, handing over an envelope. \n\"So you're suing me for a share of my excrement!\" \n\"In a nutshell - to be O'Relily-like\" he chirps. \n\"You bastard!\" \n\"However, I will bring something tangible to the party.\" \n\"What's that?\" \n\"I won't tell anyone that the supermarket down the road put you up to this, AND, I do believe that you could claim your food, drink and toilet paper as business expenses.\" \n\"Oooo yes,\" I blurt, penny dropping. \n\"So I take it I'm a 50 per cent shareholder in BIP PLC?\" \n\"Ah... 25 per cent, and the company will shout you curry and lagers - for research purposes.\" \n\"Done!\" ® \n"}

But it should work exactly the same as the power supply you want it to replace.\" \n\"Tell you what,\" I say, realising that this could go on for some time: \"Why don't you pop up here and we'll show you the problem.\" \n\"I guess so,\" the stores guy says, knowing full well that he was employed a couple of days after the last time this phrase was used... \nTen minutes later, he's up in Mission Control, and unless I'm very much mistaken (which rarely occurs) he's got a dictaphone running in his pocket. \nSigh. \n\"OK!\" I snap, \"Let me show you what I mean. Over here, we have the dead power supply which came out of our box, and over here we have the replacement power supply. Does anything strike you as different about them?\" \n\"Well the new one is smaller I guess.\" \n\"Indeed. Allow me to demonstrate!\" \nI slide the supply down the rails, wiggle it around for a bit until the contacts line up, then push it home. \n\"It plugs into the machine!\" the stores bloke comments. \n\"Leaving a large hole along one edge.\" \n\"Couldn't you just cover it up with some tape?\" he suggests helpfully \n\"Perhaps in the technological equivalent of the third world, yes, but in the real world, no. So how about we get the part we ordered?\" \n\"Well it's like this,\" he starts \"I enter your part in the system and it finds a cheaper alternative and automatically chooses it. I'm not allowed to chose anything else.\" \n\"You wa?\" the PFY asks, horrified. \n\"It's the new financials system - it does everything for you. I just enter the number required and the shipping requirements\" he sweats. \n\"I see. Thank you for your time\" \n. . one hour later . . \n\"It's a vendor substitute!\" the Beancounter tells me, after I point out the fly in the ointment for the second time. \n\"It's A vendor substitute, not THE vendor substitute,\" I repeat. \n\"Yes but it must work exactly the same way!\" \n\"It provides the same power, but it's not the same unit - so it doesn't fit properly.\" \n\"But it does the same job!\" \n\"No, because an element of the power supply is cooling, and if it doesn't fit properly, the cooling doesn't work.\" \n\"It doesn't say 'Power supply and cooling ' on the description,\" he responds. \n\"Ah right. So if it doesn't say it in the description, then it's not supposed to do it?\" \n\"Obviously. I mean if it was meant to do cooling, they would call it a 'power and cooling unit' and probably charge us more for it.\" \n\"So we can't get the right power supply?\" the PFY calls from across the room. \n\"The ordering system will choose the cheapest alternative. Perhaps you could get the original vendor to change the description of that part and give it a new part number?\" he adds helpfully, not realising that the chances of getting a vendor to change a part number are lower than the Titanic's golden rivet... \"That way there wouldn't be a substitute part.\" \n\"Or maybe we could just override it this once?\" I suggest. \n\"Oh no,\" he blurts chuckling at the thought, \"We have a policy of not overriding the system - it sets a bad precedent you see.\" \n\"So nothing's going to happen till we get the vendor to change their part number?\" I ask. \n\"It's like you read my mind,\" he replies smugly. \n...Later that same day.... \n>Ring< \n\"Systems!\" the PFY blurts, slapping the phone on hands free as soon as he sees the calling number. \n\"There's a problem with the lift!\" a familiar voice echoes tinnily. \n\"What's that then?\" the PFY asks. \n\"It's stuck on the 6th floor!\" the voice responds. \n\"No....\" the PFY responds, tapping away on the lift interface. \"It's stuck on the 6.01999th floor.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"It's on the 6.01999ths floor. It's slightly overshot the top floor.\" \n\"Well can you get it to get back down?\" \n\"Hang on, I'll get Simon.\" \n..The PFY and I finish our game of poker... \n\"Hello, Systems.\" \n\"I'm stuck in a lift on the 6.01999th floor.\" \n\"We haven't got a 6.01999th floor!\" I reply. \n\"That's what your assistant said, we'd overshot or something.\" \n\"Hang on.\" >clickety< \"Ohh yes, so you have. That was silly.\" \n\"What do you mean? It's not like we chose to go there!\" \n\"True.\" \n\"Can you get us down?\" \n\"I'm not sure I can. You see it's described as a 'Lift', not a Drop or a Fall.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"You're in a Lift, i.e. UP. I could call the service company, but they might say that if it were meant to go down as well as up it would be called a 'Lift and Fall or Drop or something'.\" \n\"What?!\" \n\"See, it's lifted you, like it said in the description of the device - so technically, if the lift did anything else, it would be in the description and they'd charge more for it - like that power supply we had this morning.\" \n\"Oh. It's you.\" \n\"Now I could ring the lift company and ask them if they'd change the description of this unit so that it's clear that it goes both up and down - but that's liable to take some considerable time.\" \n\"Or we could just get out the escape hatch,\" he snaps. \n\"Ordinarily, yes, but when you're at the absolute top of the shaft the proximity of the motor prevents the escape hatch from opening - uh - so I've been told.\" \n\"Look just make the thing go down will you?\" he says, a touch of angst creeping into his voice. \n\"You mean override the system?\" I ask \"Because we have a policy about overr..\" \n\"ALRIGHT, I'LL GET YOUR BLOODY POWERSUPPLY.\" \n\"Really? Would you?\" I gush \"That would be fantastic! Now what about on all future lift trips?\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Well if you could permanently override the purchasing system for us, I think I might be able to override the lift system for you....\" \n\"And if I don't agree I'll be stuck here forever?\" \n\"It's like you read my mind!\" ® \n"}

A normal, ordinary day at Mission Control. The usual bunch of what the PFY and I refer to as idiot calls, but nothing untoward or out of the ordinary. \nA day like any other. \nTill the Boss gets involved because no one's paid attention to him all week. His need to be recognised in his role manifests itself today as the requirement to make some sweeping changes to the Computer Usage Policy of the company. \n\"It's just that we should be consistent with our other policies,\" he says. \"We should have some form of statement to say that you mustn't use computers to harass people for instance.\" \n\"Isn't that already in the company's code-of-conduct?\" \n\"Yes, but it doesn't refer to using computers!\" \n\"It's a blanket cover!\" I respond. \n\"No, because someone could say that email isn't harassing.\" \n\"Something a mailbomb program takes a very short time to disprove.\" \n\"So it's true, you can harass someone with email!\" \n\"YOU CAN HARRASS SOMEONE WITH A BLOODY SAUSAGE ON A STICK, BUT WE DON'T NEED A SAUSAGE USE POLICY TO TELL US NOT TO!\" I shout, losing my rag. \n\"And you really don't want him to prove that last point….\" the PFY advises. \n\"But shouldn’t we be clear about what people should and shouldn't do with computers?\" \n\"Indeed.\" I say, rage subsiding. \"But if an existing policy has it covered, why introduce another piece of bureaucracy?\" \n\"Ok, so maybe harassment is covered, but what about privacy? What about someone reading my email?\" he asks. \n\"What do you mean?\" the PFY asks a little too casually. \n\"Someone. Reading my email without my permission.\" \n\"I think that's covered by the existing Computer Usage Policy where it says that no-one should attempt to access information that they're not entitled to access.\" \n\"But someone might access it, mightn't they?\" \n\"They could, yes, but they'd leave audit information in the server logs.\" \n\"But YOU can erase that information, can't you?\" he asks. \n\"We COULD erase it, yes, but in practice it's a lot harder than that,\" I admit. \n\"Really? How?\" \n\"Well, there's audit trails, gaps in logfiles, that sort of thing. I mean if someone were to cover up access to you email, there'd be a myriad of things they'd have to do to make sure it remains undiscovered.\" \n\"Like what?\" \n\"Suspend auditing, strip the evidence from the audit file, recreate false evidence to cover up the gaps when the evidence disappeared, possibly tamper with the system time, insert false audit records to cover the time lapse where the auditing was suspended, untamper with the system time and then resume auditing. Off the top of my head of course.\" \n\"And how long would that take?\" \n\"Oh, the commonplace user would take days - with mistakes, etc. - to do all that.\" \n\"And you?\" \n\"I usually do it while the PFY’s getting a coffee. Mind you, I do have a script that does most of it…\" \n\"THIS IS EXACTLY MY POINT! WE NEED POLICY TO SAY IT SHOULDN'T BE DONE.\" \n\"And you believe that a policy would prevent this?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"There's no policy to say that I shouldn't push the social club piano off the balcony while you're walking underneath it, but it hasn't happened so far!!\" \n“It’s not my problem, because I’m only interested in computing policy.” \n“So if he pushed a desktop machine off the balcony, you’d be concerned?” the PFY asks. \n“It’s not a recognized or commonplace use of a computer.” \n“It is if it’s got OS2 installed on it!” I respond, confusing the Boss and alienating another batch of OS2-loving readers. On purpose. \n\"All I'm worried about is computers,\" the Boss re-states. \"And now , the privacy of my email.\" \n\"Don't worry, we don't access email that we're not entitled to access,\" I respond. \n\"Which email is that?\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Which email are you not entitled to access?\" \n\"None of it.\" \n\"So you mean that you're entitled to access all email?\" \n\"Yes, for the purposes outlined in the service level agreement in our individual contracts with the company. In fact, we're pretty much required to read your email.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"To maintain performance and reliability of the server, to fix problems before they occur.\" \n\"How?\" the Boss gasps, completely thrown by this revelation. \n\"Well say there's a server issue with lack of disk resource in the mail store. Obviously we would need to investigate the individual users to see where the resource is wasted.\" \n\"Why not just see who's using the most space?\" \n\"Because that doesn't necessarily find mailboxes responsible for, say, fragmentation. I mean do you honestly think that the PFY and I enjoy trolling through the inane messages to your sister-in-law? You might wish to slip away for a quiet weekend in Bristol with her while your wife's visiting your son in Egypt, but WE just don't need to know that.\" \n\"But we do,\" the PFY adds slyly. \n\"So you're saying I should just drop the policy idea altogether and nothing more will be said?\" \n\"Exactly.\" \n\"But how do we discipline questionable computer use?\" \n\"The old fashioned way,\" I reply. \n\"Interviews, recommendations then dismissal?\" \n\"No, I said the old fashioned way, not the slow way.\" \n\"What's the old fashioned way?\" \n\"Threats, blackmail.\" \n\"And when that doesn't work?\" the Boss asks, doubtfully. \n\"The old toaster in the shower has been known to work.\" \n\"I.. ... We thought that was a cry for help?!\" the Boss gasps, remembering an incident a few weeks back involving a helpdesker with a penchant for running port scanners to find fileshares he shouldn't... \n\"I think I actually did hear a cry for help at the time. But that was a LONG time before the ambulance showed up...\" \n\"I can't believe you'd do that!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"*I* can't believe the PFY would put a couple of slices of bread in the toaster beforehand,\" I add. \"Now that really confused people - bizarre accident or strange cry for help?\" \n\"Yes,\" the PFY chuckles, remembering the incident fondly. \n\"Right, well, I'll just... go and put this in...\" \n\"The shredder,\" the PFY says. \nWhat do you know, it looks like being a good day after all! ® \n"}

Tightening up the place a little?\" \n\"Yes, well, in these troubled times…\" the Boss burbles, moving quickly on to the next batch of people. \n\"Troubled times, my arse!\" the PFY snaps, echoing my own thoughts. \n\"Indeed,\" I say. \"Let's just see what the Mailsafex has to say!\" \nI chuck the card into the X-ray unit we borrowed (late at night, without asking, for an indefinite period) from the mail room. \n\"Ooooh,\" I blurt. \"I spy, with my little eye, something beginning with RFID transponder.\" \n\"An RFID transponder?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Indeed! >sigh< They must think we came down in the last service pack...\" \n. . . \nLater that day at the Boss' office. \n>knock< >knock< \n\"Wha - how the hell did you get there?\" the Boss asks, quickly flicking away from what looks to be a geeky version of the Marauders Map, complete with thumbnails of people wandering about the building. \n\"Walked?\" \n\"Uh - yes, right, of course, how interesting,\" the Boss gabbles, as he attempts to seem busy and distract my attention till the application closes. \n\"I was just wanting you to sign off this expense claim,\" I say, handing over a piece of paper. \n\"Not a problem,\" he gabbles, so rattled he's not noticed that the important fields are filled out in pencil. \"So how's that.. uh.. new ID card working out for you?\" \n\"This?\" I say, holding up my card. \n\"Yes, that's it...or is that the old one?\" the Boss says, holding out his hand. \nI hand the card over and he burbles about appreciating technology of modern access methods, blah, blah, blah, whilst copping a quick shufti at it. \n\"It's got a hole in it!\" he says. \n\"Yeah, I was going to hang it off one of those retractable cord things that people hook onto their belts, then I remembered how sad and geeky they look.

I'm installing the secretary’s copier.\" \n\"And you put a hole in your card as well?\" the Boss asks drily. \n\"Yeah, and I thought the better of wearing it!\" \n\"So you know about the RFID thing?\" he sighs. \n\"What RFID thing?\" I ask blankly. \n\"Don't play games with me - in your ID card. They're afraid of a civil liberties outcry.\" \n\"So why did you do it?\" \nThe Boss thinks about it for a bit, then makes a quick decision. \n\"Come in - both of you - and close the door. . . >slam< This isn't for public consumption\" he blurts. \n\"Ah... like the cafeteria's macaroni cheese\" the PFY nods. \nThe Boss ignores him and continues. \"There’s been a lot of thefts recently – small things mostly, a coffee mug here, a pair of sunglasses there – nothing much to get upset about. But last month someone stole the X-ray machine from the mailroom!\" \n\"The thieving bastards!\" the PFY cries \"What did security say?\" \n\"Nothing. As usual,\" he snaps, annoyed. \"So we got a private company in to fit these detectors under the guise of upgrading the readers so we’ll know where everyone is. And we’re changing things so you'll need a card for everything - to use the lifts, do photocopying, get lunch at the cafeteria – you name it.\" \n\"So people keep their cards with them. Sneaky,\" the PFY says. \"And then you'll know EXACTLY where people are.\" \n\"You know what you should do?\" I say. \n\"What?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Replace all asset tags with RFIDs as well - like RFIDs are supposed to be used - that way you'll know who left the building AND what equipment they took with them....\" \n\"I... Yes!\" the Boss gasps. \"So we'll know who stole it!!\" \n\"Exactly!\" \n...two weeks later the Boss is helping security with their enquiries... \nIt seems he didn't notice the self-adhesive RFID tag (of every piece of kit we wanted replaced) stuck on the 'letters to the editor page' of the newspaper he obligingly took to the tube with him on the way home. \nAnd it seems that no-one noticed the aforementioned pieces of kit accelerating at 9.81m\/s from the second floor Mission Control window into the skip bin below. \nBut security did notice the thefts, eventually. \nAnd the discovery of the mail scanner in the Boss's office didn't help either... ® \n"}

And they want to have a quiet interview!!! \n. . . \nWhat the hell, I am bored. \n\"Is there some reason you were looking at that porn site?\" the HR Guy asks, carefully \n\"Apart from checking out the girls?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"I don't think so.

Knobface?\" \nThere's an extended pause while the HR Guy contemplates some form of retaliatory attack, thinks the better of it, and goes to weep to the company solicitors. A couple of hours later he comes back with some fairly weak Force Majeur clause which would hold as much water as a paper g-string. \nStill, I am bored.... \n\"Which leads us to the fact that you're still in contravention of company policy,\" the HR guy continues. \n\"Ok, it's a fair cop,\" I say. \n\"So you're admitting that you committed an act which could have you dismissed?\" \n\"My contract terminated, yes.\" \n\"Knowingly?\" \n\"Sure.\" \n\"You don't seem to be taking this situation very seriously.

Although I will be pursuing the company for the costs of my treatment.\" \n\"What treatment?\" \n\"The porn equivalent of methadone. Apparently it involves daily doses of bikini calendar photos.\" \n\"You can't be serious!\" \n\"No, you're probably right. I guess I'll just have to make a full and frank disclosure as part of my class action suit against the company - just before the big share float.\" \n\"I think you'll find a class action suit is where a group of ...\" \n\"Would you look at the bezels on her!\" the PFY snaps from behind his monitor having until now been silent. \n\"Ah. Well, how about we forget the whole thing then?\" the HR Guy says, realising that this could get rather nasty... \n\"That'll be fine,\" I say. \"And could you close the door on your way out... knobface?\" \nI think I'll wait till next week to get help for my p2p piracy problem.... ® \n"}

These ones are the ' A ' model and are far superior.\" \n\"How do we know this?\" \n\"Because the A models aren't available in the shops.\" \n\"Neither are asbestos face masks.\" \n\"What? No, these are good equipment. They're a special new line.\" \n\"New? Or does our friend Bruce just get out his Letraset kit and add an A to the model number before he ships them to you?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"No, no, I've been assured that these are the premium quality item,\" he says, pointing on the page to an asterix and its accompanying footnote. \n\"Yes,\" I say. \"I always feel more assured when I know a vendor has gone to the trouble of adding a footnote to their marketing information. I mean they wouldn't fake that would they?\" \n\"They can't!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Ah, but this isn't marketing literature, this is in-house and not for distribution!\" he says, pointing to the large watermark image in the background. \n\"Oh well that's fine then. When I see ‘NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION’ as a watermark I know I'm not being lied to. It's only the one saying ‘WE'RE RIPPING YOU OFF!’ that has me Worried.\" \n\"Are you suggesting that the salesman is playing me... for a fool.\" \n\"No, no, I wasn't suggesting that, I was implying it. There's a slight difference. But to be completely frank, I think he's...\" \n\"Riding you like a pony!\" the PFY says. \n\"Uh...\" \n\"Taking your ass downtown!\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Pushing you like a pram!\" \n>KZZZERT!< \n\"I must apologize for my assistant. It's been some time since he had a reset and so he's probably had a memory leak. Oh, and judging by the floor under his chair, not JUST a memory leak. Woopsy, must turn down the voltage a touch. Now, as I was saying, to be frank I think you're being tucked.\" \n\"Beg your pardon?\" \n\"Tucked. As is stitched. They only good thing is that you're probably getting a large number of drinks out of this, which makes up for it in a way.\" \n\"Uh.. I... I'm an alcoholic,\" he says. \"So I don't..\" \n\"Ah. Muy bad, as they say. Still, if you were ever to take it up again I'm sure he'd be the man to know and would be most oblig...\" \n>KZEERT!< \n\"Sorry about my supervisor,\" the PFY says, pulling out a screwdriver and giving my cattle prod a bit of a tweak. \"Memory leak. And >sniff< possibly a brown out problem. He's right, it is set a little high. Short term effects too. Anyway, so we think he's lying to you and you're either too stupid or lazy to figure that our...\" \n>KZERT!< \n\"So, what I'd suggest is that you look at the prices we were getting from vendors before and compare them with the ones they're trying to palm off on you now.\" \n\"I did! But these are better quality items and will last longer, which means that over the long term they work out cheaper. And if they last longer they'll need less maintenance which means that the Total Cost of Ownership is..\" \n\"TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP!? IT'S A BLOODY MONITOR. YOU PLUG IT IN AND TURN IT ON. WHEN IT BLOWS UP YOU GET ANOTHER ONE! YOU DON'T PROGRAM IT, YOU DON'T VIRUS SCAN IT, THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP IS WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT, WHICH IN THIS CASE IS TOO BLOODY MU..\" \n>KZERT!< \n\"What I believe my supervisor is trying to impart is that TCO in this instance is crap. Now, have you actually ORDERED any of this?\" \n\"No, but I'm planning to email an order in later this morning.\" \n\"You mean WERE planning to email an order in...\" \n\"No, we need monitors and this is the best deal we can get from the vendors. And as the IT Purchasing Officer for the company it's my duty to pick the best value for m..\" \n>KZERT< \n\"Okay,\" I say. \"Do YOU want to send that order?\" \n\"Yep,\" the PFY says, \"and I won't forget to put the asterix and footnote saying: ‘ You have to be bloody joking’ .\" \n\"And the Watermark with ‘ Get Stuffed! ’ on it. And then I'll have a quick chat with Bruce about that time he tried to pick up his Boss's wife at a product launch to see if that helps the price any.\" \n\"Ooooh!!!

Actually, better run two of each.\" \n\"Ok, it'll be a big job, as they'll either run a small post or an ugly piece of capping down the middle of the window which the building owner will hate. So who do I charge the work to?\" \n\"It's your area so I guess you'd be paying for it.\" \n\"Doubtful. Eighteen months ago when this floor was completely refitted we specified modular underfloor cabling in a raised floor config, utilising, I might add, oversize floor tiles for futureproofing - and your department axed that out of the budget saying it was an unneccesary expense for what is basically a static workplace area.\" \n\"Uh, that wasn't our department, that was the auditors.\" \n\"Who work?\" \n\"Uh.. Over there,\" he says, pointing into a small cube farm separate from the rest of the floor. \n\"Oh, in YOUR department?\" \n\"Yes, but they don't report to me, they report to the Audit Manager.\" \n\"Who reports to?\" \n\"Well me, but that's different. It's a whole separate thing.\" \n\"And so is asking us to make changes to a budget cabling job after we'd warned you that it'd cost a fortune to change.\" \n\"Ok, I suppose we could just run long cables across the floor.\" \n\"Till the Health and Safety people notice, yes.\" \n\"Oh. So it looks like we'll have to use the ceiling space.\" \n\"I suppose so. Unless....\" \n\"Unless?\" \n\"Unless we use the ceiling space of the floor below, run the cables in that, get a bloke with a cement cutter and jackhammer to make some holes in the concrete floor to install some flush mounting power and data boxes onto.\" \n\"What'll it cost?\" \n\"Oh, about a grand, fifteen hundred?\" \n\"1500 pounds?!\" \n\"Lets say two to be on the safe side. Course, it's about 750 if you want them to do a weekend job for cash with no insurance, tax or warranty.\" \n\"It's a hole! They're drilling a hole, that's all! How can a hole be worth two thousand pounds?\" \n\"It's specialised equipment! They're professionals!\" \n\"Can't you drill the hole?\" \n\"What, with the IT department's little hammer drill and a masonry bit? It'd take about two hours and drive everyone barmy - and we don't have a masonry bit that long.\" \n\"I... So how... do we do the... uh.. under-the-table thing?\" \n\"You grab a wadge of petty cash - call it pin money or something - shove it in a brown envelope and drop it off to me. I'll hand it onto them and they'll drill the hole.\" \n\"You give it to them BEFORE they do the work? You don't get a receipt or anything?\" \n\"A. They'll be hiring equipment and will want the dosh up front and B. the whole idea of under-the-table jobs is no paper trail.\" \n\"It all seems a little... underhand to me.\" \n\"The good jobs always do..\" \n. . two hours later . . \n\"And it'll be done by the weekend?\" the head beancounter says, handing over a brown envelope self-consciously like a crim caught on videotape.

That weekend . . . \n\"So you've propped the drill up between two chairs with a stack of phone books taped to the handle..\" \n\"To simulate the pressure of a human arm,\" I add. \n\"..with the trigger taped on…\" \n\"Yep, and by my calculation the first hole should be drilled in about 4.5 pints time!\" \n\"Best get drinking then!\" \n. . . 4.5 hours later . . . \n\"Ok, that's one hole done. Now we need to drill eight more holes around it to make room for the flush box mount.\" \n\"How deep?\" \n\"About a pint.\" \n. . . Eight pint trips and a large amount of hammering later. . . \n\"F - ing magic!\" the PFY slurs. \"But what's that...\" \n. . . . \n\"You didn't run the cables?\" the head Beancounter whines, when we get in on Monday. \n\"No, there was a bit of a problem, so we didn't get a chance to start work.\" \n\"Problem?\" \n\"Yeah, they'd done the hole when one of the newer, STUPIDER contractors thought he'd seen an obstruction and rammed the drill in the hole several times.\" \n\"Yes, and?\" \n\"And hit the water line for the fire extinguishers.\" \n\"Was there any damage?\" \n\"No no, just flooded the third floor. It'll need new carpets!\" \n\"We‘ll sue!\" \n\"You COULD sue, but then you'd have to fess up to the whole under-the-table thing, which would mean the Tax department would probably find out, which given your position in the company would probably mean the whole place would be audited with all the vigor of a dark night at a men's prison, it doesn't really bear thinking about...\" \n\"I....... suppose you're right.

Well, that's not completely true, myself and my assistant do, and the support staff have 'Power User' access.\" \n\"But it's my machine!\" \n\"No, it's the Company's machine - you're just using it.\" \n\"The company bought the machine for me!\" \n\"For you to USE, yes.

I could even subcontract the job out to one of the more aggressive of the company's security team with a reputation for brutality and the personality of a serial killer, but that's not the way we do things around here.\" \n\"Oh,\" he sighs, danger averted. \n\"No, I'll just make a slight change to the group policy that will remove everyone's jukebox application, and when they ask, I'll tell them that it was you that brought it to my attention.\" \n\"I.. You wouldn't dare!\" \n>clickety< \n\"Already done!\" \nThe next day the wheels fall off as there's a groundswell of support for the jukebox application from people like the Head of IT and the CEO who are among those inconvenienced by the removal. \nSigh. \nI get the PFY to make the necessary reversals to the Group Policy then tell everyone to reboot, which causes the network to grind for a couple of hours. \nSigh. \nYet again the phone rings and I notice it's my troublemaker, so I take the call.

Oh, and could you come and do it personally?\" \n\"I think you're mistaking the battle for the war,\" I say. \"We're still not permitting administrative access.\" \n\"I think you are!\" he replies, pulling an ace from his sleeve. \"I'd had a little meeting with the CEO and he agrees that I should be allowed to install the applications I need to do my job.

I'll send you our literature on the short listing criteria, selection and interview process.\" \n\"Roger!\" \nTen minutes later I'm looking through the pages and pages of crap that we're supposed to go through to put someone into a job. \n\"This is bloody ridiculous!\" I cry. \n\"What is?\" the Boss asks, wandering into Mission Control. \n\"All the crap attached to choosing someone for a job!\" \n\"Oh yeah, apparently they tightened things up a couple of months ago,\" the Boss says. \"But how bad can it be?\" \n\"How bad can it be? Look: 'The company prides itself of being an Equal Opportunity Employer' . What does that mean ?\" \n\"It means that we we're not prejudiced in our selection techniques.\" \n\"Of course we're bloody prejudiced! We want someone who can do that job!\" \n\"Yes, yes, but if two people came in and one of them was… er…\" \n\"A 54-year-old black lesbian hippo with one leg who worshipped chutney,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Er.. yes, then we would appoint the, er, them!\" \n\"Instead of the other applicant?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Well because we're giving them an equal opportunity.\" \n\"No I think you mean Affirmative Action ,\" the PFY comments. Equal Opportunities means that they'd both be considered regardless of who they were. Affirmative Action is intended to address a perceived lack of some group in a company for PR purposes.” \n\"It's not for P.R!\" \n\"Right,\" the PFY says dubiously. \n\"Well this flies in the face of my Unequal Opportunities Policy!\" I say. \n\"Your what?!?\" \n\"Unequal Opportunities Policy. Which is basically 'if you can do the job, you're in!'. Couldn't give a crap about age, sex, race, etc. It's a simple policy, but it seems to work. Unless…\" \n\"Unless what!?\" \n\"Unless you're a thicko. I can't stand thickos. No offence.\" \n\"What do you mean?!\" \n\"Thickos, you know, people who can't... well.. tie their shoelaces without assistance. No offence.\" \n\"What do you mean 'no offence'!?\" \n\"Well you know, some people get upset when you say something like that - especially if they're a complete 'tard. No offence\" \nFive minutes later the Boss has company, in the form of the PR woman that'd spoken to me earlier. \n\"Uh.. there's some problem with our appointments policy?\" she asks, oozing diplomacy. \n\"Well I was just saying that it's bollocks really. I mean down at our level no-one really gives a crap about the whole age\/sex\/colour\/creed thing so long as you're good at your job. The thing we do have a problem with is people who are too thick for their role. No offence, No offence.\" \n\"Are you implying that we're stupid?\" \n\"Uh... Lets see, how can I say this best? Ah! An intelligent person would not have needed to ask that question! No offence. No offence\" \n\"I have a Masters Degree in Gender Studies!\" the HR woman snaps. \n\"Ooooh, now there's a degree that's hugely marketable!\" the PFY blurts sarcastically. \n\"I've been published several times in the Journal of Employment Diversity!!\" \n\"And I'm sure both their readers enjoyed it,\" I add. \"However I doubt that this means you have the wherewithal to properly administer a desktop machine.\" \n\"What's that got to do with it?\" \n\"We're talking about the position of a desktop support person for the Finance area, someone who'll need skills in desktop support, minor administration, application installation and management, etc - all technical tasks requiring more than a little savvy when it comes to computing.\" \n\"Ah,\" the Boss says. \"You were talking about computing intelligence! I understand now. You see, the way you worded it made it appear like you were suggesting that I - and Sheree here - were, well, stupid.\" \n\"Oh, I see what you mean,\" I say . \"Unfortunately when you're in a position like mine you tend to see things in black and white as opposed to shades of grey. So whereas you might see yourself as in the upper 90 percents of intelligence, I might see you as in the lower 15s.\" \n\"Because of our knowledge of the spheres of computing is much less than your own!\" the HR woman adds. \n\"Yes, that too,\" the PFY says. \n\"What do you mean?\" she asks, frowning. \n\"Well, that, and because you're thicko,\" the PFY says. \nAnd there go the wheels from the going-home-early plan. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.

Everyone in the company uses it, it's complete crap and countless hours of work have been lost pounding away at it.\" \n\"Are we still talking about the Essex bird?\" I ask, just to keep things light hearted. \nLead Balloon. \n\"So we FINALLY get to replace the kit, which means we can rip out the box, remove all the aged terminal servers and all the terminals.\" \n\"And PLACE them in the bin.\" \n\"We had that option, yes. But we thought - rightly so, as it happened - that there would be people in the company who might want to express their discontent in some physical manner by dropping, hurling or in some cases screaming-wailing-gnashing-of-teeth-accompanied-punting these units off the roof into the skip. And it went down a treat\" \n\"No it didn't! It was a complete shambles! The side street was absolutely littered with broken plastic, glass and pieces of metal\" \n\"Yeah, it was fantastic!\" \n\"That street is reserved managerial parking! You couldn't drive anywhere NEAR there with all that rubbish on the ground! Not only that, we've also been fined by the local council for littering, AFTER assuring them that we were having the place professionally cleaned with a magnetic sweeper! And don't think I didn't notice that you put the bin on top of my car park. Some of that glass was embedded in the road surface! Big chunks in some cases! It cost a fortune to tidy up!\" \n\"Yeah Well, No-one said fun was cheap! Anyway, we made a penny or two on it.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"We sold the kit to people. 10 quid a monitor.\" \n\"What if people wanted to take them home?\" \n\"Ok, so you're on top of a building where you're not supposed to be in the first place, the winds in your hair you feel like king of the world and you've got a pussy old dumb terminal in your hands. Are you going to lug it downstairs, onto the tube and home, or are you going to SEIZE VENGEANCE BY THE BALLS AND GIVE THEM A GOOD SQUEEZE! \" \n\"Y.. I.. How much did you make?\" \n\"Just under a thousand quid,\" the PFY responds. \n\"We had 100 terminals?\" \n\"No, but we started auctioning the bigger stuff. The 9 track tape unit went for 120 quid,\" the PFY replies. \n\"And the ginormous disk drive went for 150,\" I add. \n\"Yes, but that was too heavy to get any real distance from the building. It basically plummeted onto the footpath taking out that parking sign. But if it had had wheels on it like the main CPU unit it would have made the street!\" \n\"How much did the main cpu go for?\" the Boss asks, interested now. \n\"Oh nothing. That was a prize for the best technique.\" \n\"Technique?\" \n\"Yeah this woman from Data Entry pool used the cables and did a sort of hammer throw which hit the extreme corner of the bin and the monitor exploded into a ball of bits.

So I just aim it downwards from here for about 2 of these extension pipes, across for about 3 pipes, then up till it breaks ground.\" \n\"Riiighhht. So these pipes are.. what.. 5 metres long?\" \n\"Yep.\" \n\"Ok so what about 2 pipes down, two pipes across and up, given that the road is about 8 metres wide?\" \n\"Hmm, it's worth a crack I guess.\" \n. . . . one hour later . . . \n\"What was that?!\" the PFY gasps, as the machine shudders wildly and stops about halfway through the crossing process. \n\"Not sure,\" I say, comparing the distances with a services map I stole from the council. \"Ah. We've either hit a sewer with a slight build-up of gas, or.....\" \n\"Or?\" \n\"The front carriage of a Circle Line train.\" \n\"F***!\" the PFY squeaks. \n\"Calm down,\" I say, putting the machine into reverse and turning it over on battery \"We'll back this out and redrill it a couple of metres higher and it'll be swe.. Uh-oh.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"It looks like the train's bent the front section of the drill pipe which is stalling the thruster engine so we can't pull it back!\" \n\"S***!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Again, don't worry, we have a spare drill bit.\" \n\"Oh,\" he sighs. \n\"Yes, all you need to do is sneak down the tunnel and pull the bent section out of the wall. And recover the drill head.\" \n\"You're f***ing joking!\" the PFY says. \nOne long argument, several threats and 20 minutes later, my cellphone rings. \n\"Yep?... . ... What? . . . You'll have to speak up... Oh it's you! Found nothing Eh? Yeah well it must have been the old sewer after all. And I think the shuddering was because it had run out of gas. Pop into a service station and grab us about four gallons of diesel will you?!\" \nI cut the PFY off in the middle of a particularly colourful stream of abuse and recalculate my directions. By the time the PFY arrives I've got a new plan. \n\"Ok change of plans! It's too near morning to redrill, so we'll pull the drill sections back and go again tomorrow.\" \n\"Right.\" \n. . .

The supervisor's doing this monster push on gathering statistics to make his group seem like the heart and soul of the department in a transparent attempt to get more money for his role. \nOrdinarily, I quite like the Helpdesk people in a benevolent (as opposed to malevolent) way as they do some valuable work in preventing us being inundated by every halfwit who can work a phone. \nHOWEVER... \nIn the past week the supervisor has had them logging calls for every simple call that comes their way and injecting these calls into our queue for processing. Even my automated process for resolving calls has failed due to the number and frequency of crap coming my way. \n\"It's nothing personal,\" the Helpdesk supervisor assures me when I bring it up. \"It's just we're starting to use the software more fully and in the process we realise that we can use the statistics it produces to judge the impact on the company!\" \n\"How so?\" I ask, realising that this might be a foolish question with a long and tedious answer. \n\"Well, take the email outage the other day.\" \n\"What email outage?\" \n\"When people said that their mail wasn't working?\" \n\"You mean when we'd published an outage notification for 15 minutes so we could swap in a new MX handler?\" \n\"Yeah, I don't know, it might have been that.

(You know the sort of thing - \"I ported Server 2003 to my cellphone in Java in two days - want to browse my file share?\" war stories, etc.) \nI make a special effort not to meet any of their eyes just in case they try to draw me into their unholy circle with their outrageous claims (i.e. the location of the Steve Jobs glove puppet) whilst simultaneously trying to take on the colour and texture of the wall behind me. The PFY is miles ahead of me and is almost transparent to the technical eye. \nAs I'm arranging myself to look like furniture I notice something which disturbs me further - if indeed someone with my Machiavellian and sadistic tendencies towards users could become more disturbed - the arrival of a contingent of furry teeth from the Linux Geek bat cave. \n\"Hmmm,\" I murmur. \n\"What?\" the PFY asks, the background shimmering slightly like a poor rendition of Predator. \n\"Critical Mass,\" I say. \n\"Hmm?\" \n\"Critical Mass of geeks.\" \n\"What?!\" \n\">Sigh< As any Nuclear Physicist will tell you if you feed him enough lagers, bringing two masses of radioactive substances into close to each other is not a good thing.

Size XXXXL if I'm not mistaken. \nLuckily they're more like carbon rods in a situation like this and the atmosphere of the pub improves ever so slightly. \nIt's the Mac geeks sliding in the back way that introduce the cold hand of fear to my internal organs. \nArmageddon is upon us! \nSlowly, so as not to draw any attention to ourselves, the PFY and I make my way towards the door posing as a German tourists mit eine swartzkopf emergency, but before we get there the PFY stops. \n\"There doesn't seem to be any trouble,\" he says, gesturing at the assembled geeks clustered in their groups. \n\"No, not now .

Oooh, but look - a few of them are going to the bar for an interim drink - or what we in the chemistry trade call a Catalyst.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Something which helps facilitate a reaction.\" \n\"Ah. And so it's all on then?\" \n\"Not exactly,\" I say, entering my closet-Einstein persona \"The OS2 people are defusing the situation a little because the groups are concentrating their ridicule at them instead of each other - which is stalling the reaction.

True, a lesser reaction might occur at another place - the bogs, the door, but nothing with the potential for raw energy as what could happen in this room, if...\" \n\"If...?\" \n. . . \n\"Who'd have thought,\" I say, expelling a meaningless sentence fragment - a tactic which has all the pull of the Death Star's tractor beam in drawing a geek into conversation. \n\"Beg Pardon?\" the Windows geek beside me says. \nTold you so. \n\"I was just saying, who'd have though that Linus Torvalds was Bill Gates' love child? It's so ironic.\" \n\"That's ridiculous!\" \n\"That's what I said, but that Linux bloke over there says he's got the DNA match and a 16mm film of the conception. Quite graphic apparently.\" \n. . . Meantime on the other side of the room . . . \n\"...and he said that Steve Jobs was working for Microsoft THE WHOLE TIME!\" the PFY says. \n. . . Seconds later at the other end of the bar . . . \n\"Is it true what those Mac guys said about the Mac moving to Windows OS because Linux performance is so crap?\" I ask. \n. . . and in the middle of the bar . . . \n\"Two shandies and 14 packets of crisps.\" one of the OS2 geeks says. \n. . . \n\"Nothing's happened!\" the PFY sniffles. \"What a load of crap!\" \n\"Be patient.\" I murmur \"Like most reactions you just need to wait for the elements to come together..

Upon his release in prison, Erfurt will have to spend five months under house arrest and three years on probation. \nErfurt pleaded guilty to gaining \"unauthorized access and recklessly damaging\" the computer system of MESC as part of an August 2004 plea bargaining agreement . He also confessed to obstructing justice over his attempts to destroy evidence of his cyber crimes, which included downloading a proprietary database, reading the email account of MESC's president and deleting data from its servers. \nErfurt admitted he hacked into MESC's systems using the systems of a competitor, Centaur, who were employing him at the time and where he continues to work. Centaur Chief Executive Officer Bruce Cahill told IDG: \"This was a private individual that happened to use a computer system at our office.

I need it!\" \n\"But even with a new battery you'll only get.. maybe eight hours tops out of both batteries - IF they're at full charge?\" I say reasonably. \n\"Not necessarily,\" the geek responds smugly - which can only mean I've stepping into his well laid trap. \"Not if I get the 1600QV battery!\" \n\"The 1600QV?\" I ask. \n\"Yes!\" he chirps happily. \"It's a Swiss-made battery which fits inside the same space as a normal battery and has three times the capacity.\" \n\"And 10 times the cost?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I.. \" he says, fumbling with a brochure. \"Well, it's in US dollars, not pounds.\" \n\"The only way that figure would look good is in Turkish lire!\" \n\"It's been okayed!\" he said. \n\"Who the hell would okay an extravaga...\" I start, penny dropping. \"The Head of IT, yes?\" \n\"Yes, he thought it was a good idea. He said you have a miscellaneous items budget for this sort of thing.\" \n\"That, copper bracelets for arthritis, earthing straps for underwear to reduce static damage and rubbing cabbage leaves on your head to cure baldness.\" \n\"It's a good battery!\" \n\"And it probably weighs about twice as much as your laptop!\" \n\"But I need to be able to be on the move!\" \nDespite our sage advice the deal is done and the order is placed. An hour or two after receiving it our user gives us a call. \n\"My new battery won't work!\" he blurts. \n\"Why?\" \n\"The support website says I probably need to buy a special high capacity charger…\" \n\"Well I think that you should probably consider...\" I respond. \n\"..and it's been approved, so can you organise that, ASAP?\" \nNgggggggggg \nI find the charger costs about twice as much as the battery which pretty much means that a single laptop has accounted for a month's worth of my miscellaneous budget - so I'm not at all happy. \nLess happy a day later when the geek calls back again . \n\"The thing weighs a ton!!\" he snaps. \n\"We told you that before you bought it!\" \n\"No, not the battery - although that's heavy too - the charger. It's heavier than my carry-on allowance! And it doesn't use US power - and I'm going there next week!!!!\" \nNggg \n\"WE TOLD YOU IT WAS GOING TO BE HEAVY!\" \n\"Yes but it's too heavy. What about a fuel cell?\" \n\"A FUEL CELL!?\" \n\"Yes, I've been reading about them, they're small, easily rechargeable and reasonably light.\" \n\"Where the hell would we get money for a fuel cell battery?\" \n\"Your boss says that you have money for R&D. This is an ideal R&D project - you could make an existing fuel cell fit in the battery compartment for me.\" \n\"I...\" \n. . . \nThere's no point in arguing any further so the PFY and I put our minds to work and three days later have a working prototype. \n\"Is that it?\" our geek asks. \"What's all the strange writing all over it?\" \n\"One bit's Arabic and the other bit Greek. It's a fuel cell from a GPS system we paid an extortionate amount for on eBay.\" \n\"And it'll work?\" \n\"Only one way to find out!\" the PFY replies, suppressing his pride. \nHe plugs it in with a due sense of trepidation and pushes the power button while the Boss braces himself for the inevitable explosion. \n..which doesn't happen... \n\"It works!\" he cries. \n\"Of course it does! And there was some space left over in the cell so we slapped a small NiCad pack in there so that you can get about 15 mins of runtime when the fuel cell's expended,\" the PFY adds. \n. . . \n10 minutes later when they're gone. \n\"So when do you think that he'll learn that it's just a NiMh battery?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Oh, probably when he's landed in the States and going through customs.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"I think US customs will let him know once that anonymous phone call about the guy carrying an unlicensed hydrogen-based explosive device has been received.\" \n\"I hardly think that...\" \n\"And after the Arabic translator picks out the words 'Death to Yankee Warmongers' from the side of the battery I'm guessing things will go downhill quite fast…\" \n\"Oh...\" the PFY says, the sheckle dropping. \"If only our powers were used for good.\" \nIf only... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.

(Well, technically , the boss had been invited to, but the invite was just sitting in his inbox.) \nAfter a little spade work, a phone call and some briefcase enhancements we're all set to go. \nAs usual it's absolute hell to get a car park around any major hotel for these sort of presentations so I'm almost bound to be given a ticket, have my car clamped or towed. (Well, technically the boss's car – but it was just sitting in the basement unused.) \nWe get there fairly late as parking on the roundabout wasn't as easy as I'd thought and as bad luck would have it the presentation's already underway. We slink in quietly and go to the registration desk. \n\"Your name?\" the woman behind the desk whispers. \nI quickly scan the list, skip my name and just pick one at random. \n\"Steve Curtis.\" \n\"The security advisor for the American Embassy?\" she asks dubiously. \nYOU LITTLE BLOODY DANCER!!! \n\"Yes Mam!\" I respond, cranking the Texan Accent knob around to 11. \nShe passes the badge over, not wanting to make a fuss. \nThe PFY rocks in, checks the name tag and greets me like an old mate. \n\"Steve!\" he blurts. \"What the hell are you doing here?!\" \n\"I work in this country, old bean!\" I cry, doing the typically shocking American impersonation of a Briton while shaking his hand. \n\"Still in computing then?\" he asks, reinforcing the lie. \n\"Hell Yeah, Security adviser at them Embassy now, and you?\" \n\"IT Manager at a company in town,\" he responds giving his name at the desk. (Well, technically the boss's name, but he's just sitting in his office not using it.) \nWe grab seats at the back of the audience where the PFY fires up his cellular network connection, downloads some appropriate graphics from a US website and prints me some \"business cards\" on his portable card printer. \nSORTED! \nAs expected, the presentation is as contradictory, confusing and uninformative as a Microsoft Security warning which leaves everyone a little fidgety at morning tea. \n\"Does anyone else wonder what the hell that was all about?\" I drawl loudly. \"I mean, it was a little content free.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" one of the presenters asks, offended at the implication that his life's work is up there significance-wise with the guy who eats bicycles. \n\"Well, it was interesting to watch, but not all useful. You basically said 'Protect your credit cards, shred your rubbish, don't say anything over the web that you don't have to and never allow companies to share your information.' I mean it's HARDLY rocket science – and I should know, I worked at NASA for five years!\" \nThe PFY leaps in on schedule and takes the fore. \n\"Which is why we've been so interested in your progress,\" he comments. \n\"We?\" I ask. \n\"The Campaign for.. Information Validation and Protection.\" \n\"You're from CIVP!\" I adlib, realizing the prerehearsed Amnesty International cover story has been ditched for something better. \n\"Yes, and we're well aware of your operation!\" \n\"Operation?\" a crusty from a banking company next to me asks. \n\"Yes, operation. They submit the biometric data of leaders of business to various agencies, labeling them people who might present security threats so that they'll be stopped at airports, etc.\" \n\"You're joking,\" the crusty gasps. \"Why?\" \n\"To introduce an identity vacuum which can be used by secret service operatives as cover.\" \n\"Sorry?\" the crusty asks. \n\"It's simple. Say you bowl into a country and someone questions your identity. How can you prove who you say you are?\" \n\"I…\" \n\"Exactly, you can't. So you might be who you say you are, or you might have an endless holiday in Guantanamo Bay to look forward to while some operative lives it up at your expense in southern Hungary. Which is why MY company has decided to provide all this information on a simple card that you carry with you.\" \n\"Really. What sort of information?\" \n\"Biometrics, thumbprint, Iris Scan, Passport, bankcard, personal details – all electronically recorded on a chip in one card.\" \n\"And that would be safe?\" \n\"Safer than your current passport which is so bulky it ends up in a hotel safe half the time.\" \nI see PFY's tack and jump in with corroborating evidence... \n\"Yes, yes, well maybe we have done that in the past, but there's no reason to think that we might do that in the future. Third party IDs like this will only confuse matters!\" I bluster. \"We'll take legal action!\" \nAfter an endorsement like that the PFY is instantly inundated with people wanting to pay the 20 quid to get their personal information 'secured' onto a plastic card and corresponding database. \nIt's like shooting fish, honestly. It's not even sporting! \nI mull over the dire legal consequences that'll inevitably befall someone who uses the information the PFY's obtaining for their own personal gain. No to mention the quasi-legal consequences of undermining the security of biometric information. \nHe could end up in prison for years! \nWell, technically the boss will be in prison for years, but he's just sitting in his office... ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.

(Told you it was a season of goodwill.) \"I think I can back-to-back one in the States, then Aberdeen, then Dubai.\" \n\"Three conferences in a row!\" one of the geeks says. \"How will you concentrate?!\" \n\"I think you're missing the JUNKET point a little,\" the PFY says. \"The Aberdeen one's just a Takedown Session.\" \n\"Takedown Session?\" \n\"As in the book,\" I prompt. \n\"The... Uh… Shimomura book!?\" the helldesk geeks asks. \n\"Yeah. Looks interesting, but is actually very, very dull.\" \n\"I quite liked it!\" the geek says. \n\"Which bit - the bit about his hobbies, love interest and how great he is or the tiny section which was actually about Mitnick?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"So I'm using Aberdeen -and the book - to sleep and adjust my clock to Dubai time,\" I continue. \n\"But surely you'll need to go to something to do your report on the Aberdeen conference?\" \n\"You're not really up to speed on the whole junket thing are you?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I...\" \nSigh. \n\"Ok, lets start with the basics,\" I say \"Selection. You choose a junket based on..?\" \n\"Speakers?\" the geek says. \n\"NO! You choose a junket based on LOCATION, SIZE, ACCOMODATION, then speakers.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Location for holiday potential, Size for the number of vendors and amount of money they'll waste, and accomodation because of the potential of the minibar.\" \n\"But if you're going to nothing in Aberdeen, why...\" \n\"Aberdeen is a rest stop,\" the PFY says. \"All you need to do it prove you went there.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"Grab the show bag, the documents and the CDs then scatter them around your desk liberally when you get back.\" \n\"But surely the Boss will…\" \n\"...do nothing because we'll have already made a pre-emptive strike!\" the PFY interjects. \n\"How?\" \n\"Easy,\" I respond. \"I pick the two largest and most incomprehensible documents, shove a couple of post-its in the really geeky parts saying 'Ideal solution for our needs' and slap them on the Boss's desk for his perusal.\" \n\"And what will that…\" \n\"The Boss is as likely to read a large technical document as OS2 is to stage a comeback. As all roads lead to Rome so will all questions will lead back to those technical documents that he hasn't read. The boss won't bring it up and we won't give him reason to. The geeky documents will slip to the bottom of the pile on his desk until ultimately he will 'accidentally' shred them.\" \n\"But surely he'll notice the cost of it all!\" \n\"Ordinarily, yes. However, we jiggered our accountancy system to report the 'annual' training budget with period of three months. So within twelve weeks it looks like we've done no training at all this year.\" \n\"In time for the next junket 'season',\" the PFY adds. \n\"But the Boss will remember won't he?\" \n\"Not when he travels TWA.\" \n\"TWA? I thought they were sold years ago?\" \n\"No, I meant Tragic Workplace Accident. By the time the 12 weeks is up the Boss is likely to have tripped down a stairwell, experimented with lethal voltages or had a mental breakdown.\" \n\"My favourite,\" the PFY chirps happily, raising a glass to some of his fondest memories. \n\"But surely someone would ask…\" \n\"And risk opening Pandora's box of retribution?\" the PFY says. \"Never!\" \n\"I... Oh. So how do we get.. uh.. training?\" \n\"Let's not be coy, it's called a junket. You get it by establishing a 'training' precedent.\" \n\"?\" \n\"You go on some training this year, a bit more next year, more the year after, until junkets just become the norm.\" \n\"So by 'next year' you mean in three months?\" \n\"In our case, yes, but in your case by 'year' I mean every four years\" \n\"But didn't you...\" \n\"There's a limit to how much money you can get your hands on in one fiscal year. So we have to 'borrow' it from other cost centre's annual budget on a quarterly basis.\" \n\"Like the Helpdesk training budget...\" the PFY adds helpfully. \n\"So we can't do any training because you've stolen our training budget?\" \n\"Yes, that about sums it up.\" \n\"But why even bother giving us a budget every 4 years then?\" \n\"Ah well, fair's fair. Besides, by that time we've racked up so much contractor's holiday allowance it starts to get a bit embarrassing.\" \n\"And you're not worried that we'll tell someone about this?\" \n\"No more that you should be about stairwells, voltages or mental illness,\" the PFY says, winking. \"And get us a couple of pints will you, before the Boss finds out who chucked a beer at his car.\" \n\"But you… I...\" \nAh well, looks like the goodwill season is over.

It seems he was made an offer he couldn't refuse which didn't involve horses or handguns but instead a large amount of money. \nThe first thing we knew of it was the abusive leaving message taped to his desktop machine when he failed to turn up after the weekend. \nSo the Head of IT is calling the usual slave traders in an attempt to track down a replacement - only they seem to be a little thin on the ground as a result of the buoyant market in the field this week. The life expectancy of bosses may have something to do with it, but I'm not too sure. \nSome form of plan has to be made so as to give the using classes the assurance they need that the health and welfare of our systems and networks are running well. Or, in other words, they need to know that someone will lose their job if we're ever caught reading the contents of their email. I could digress to discuss our plug-in to the modulated output of the package scanner, allowing us to \"read\" some parts of snail mail as well - but I won't. \nThe Head of IT is pacing which can only mean one thing. Well, two things if dumplings were on the menu at lunchtime - but for today we're in the clear - he's thinking. \nThe majority of the IQ not devoted to walking and scratching his genitals is now concentrating on the problem at hand. The PFY and I look up as a noisy gust of foul-smelling air from his nether regions signals a conclusion has been reached - much like smoke from a Vatican chimney. \n\"How about you take the job on - till we can find a replacement?\" he suggests. \n\"I'd love to, but as you know I have a position here.\" \n\"You could do both - it's only an interim measure - all you need do is answer a few calls, attend the odd meeting...\" \n\"And supervise...?\" \n\"Well yes, there's an element of supervision to the role - you two, the helpdesk supervisor and the Technician guy. Come to think of it, where is the Technician guy?\" \n\"Dave?\" \n\"Hmm?\" \n\"Dave, the Hardware Technician?\" \n\"Yes, that's him!\" \n\"Retired a year ago.\" \n\"Really? Oh well, I suppose that's one less person you'll need to supervise then!\" \n\"I think you'll find that I'm more use in a technical role as opposed to Management.\" \n\"Nonsense! A fool could do it!\" \n\"Yes, a fool generally does.\" \n\"Wha..?\" \n\"Anyway, there'd be a conflict of interest. I'd be supervising myself for a start!\" \n\"I'd be your supervisor!\" \n\"In the Management role, but as a manager I'd be managing myself in the rest of my technical role. There could be ethical issues.\" \n\"I think we'll take that risk - meantime if you could hold the fort for six weeks till we can find someone new...\" \n\"Like I said I...\" \n\"Okay there's a couple of grand in it.\" \n... \nSo this management lark is a piece of the proverbial! There's three projects which need extensive handholding to keep moving, some budgetary palaver to sort out and some contracts to be signed. \nAll in all the annual contract negotiation process for the PFY and myself go incredibly well, with management accepting the 25 per cent pay increase without question. The two grand signing bonus was just icing on the cake - I'm just a pleasure for contractors to work with! \nWith one task down I attack the budget and purchasing problem with the help of a little initiative and several hours on a popular web-based auction system.... The replacement user desktop computers were a reasonable spec, fantastically cheap and we didn't have to deal with disposing of all the packaging. True, we had to pay in cash, take delivery late at night and scrape the asset labels of another company off them, but that's just the new world of electronic business for you. \nWith the cash left in the kitty I managed to also acquire something truly meaningful to improve staff morale - a ginormous plasma telly for the staff lunchroom. ***Bonus*** \nThe only fly in the ointment is the project stuff which is so onerous it would ordinarily have had me eating my desk blotter with frustration. Still, I've devised a plan so cunning it'd qualify for a research grant to obscure the fact that I'm not contributing in any meaningful way. \n\"So how does it work?\" the PFY asks, peering over my shoulder at the email I'm about to send. \n\"Simple. I send an email to each member of each project team asking them how the project is going and if they have any questions. That'll buy me about a week.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And then in a week, I'll send the question asked to every OTHER person in the team for their comments.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"I quietly feedback the comments expressed in the worst possible light to each team member whilst implying that the team thinks that they're the weakest link.\" \n\"Ah, and so the teams implode before you have to devote any time to managing the projects.\" \n\"Precisely!\" \n\"Sneaky. But you realise you'll end up in your systems engineer role having to support all these half-arsed projects when they come back to haunt us?\" \n\"Yes well, ordinarily I would, but I fired myself this morning.\" \n\"What!?\" \n\"Yes. I saw myself working in the computer room without hearing protection and dismissed myself.\" \n\"But that's not grounds for dismissal!\" \n\"EXACTLY what I'll be saying in my personal grievance claim!\" \nOne could really get used to this Management stuff! ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.

Nothing that the company couldn't recover from now that they've outsourced the entire trading department of course, but as a result there's been a little bit of discussion at upper levels about what people should and shouldn't be doing during their working day and a hastily crafted memo has been distributed threatening instant dismissal for any staff member - no matter who - caught playing games. \nTo complete the knee-jerk reaction, the Head of IT's been called in to assure the board that we'll leave no stone unturned in the search for an early scapegoat as an example to ensure staff compliance... \nAs there's a high probability that someone will get upset the Head's passing the job down the chain - me being next in line.... \n\"A.... uh.. word if I may,\" he smarms, sidling into Mission Control. \n\"Mmmmm?\" \n\"I'd like you to find out who in the office plays games and how much time they spend doing it.\" \n\"Are there games on the computer?!\" the PFY asks, failing miserably in his attempt to sound sincere. \n\"What are you after precisely?\" I ask, using the PFY's interruption to hide Solitaire. \n\"There's been a bit of a stink from the top floor,\" the Head lies. \"Apparently someone made a suggestion that we could increase productivity by up to 50 per cent by removing games from the desktops of our users. I'd already mentioned this to your previous manager before the whole issue exploded but he suggested that he didn't think he'd have much joy in getting you to action this for him. But now that you're in his role... perhaps you'd have more success in...\" \n\"Convincing myself that we should track down game players to increase company productivity?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"It's ridiculous!\" the PFY states, full of bravado now his gaming keypad is out of sight. \n\"Yeah,\" I add. \"You'd only get about 15 per cent from games.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Sure. You'd pick up another 15 per cent from blocking porn, maybe 10 per cent blocking internet email services, another 10-15 from online auction sites, 10 per cent from banking and other personal finance and 15 or so from online newspaper and movie preview sites.\" \n\"I… How much time does that work out to?\" \n\"About 75-80 per cent.\" \n\"I hardly think it's that bad! Nothing would get done!\" \n\"I beg to differ. When that roading crew severed our internet fibre the place was like a ghost town!\" \n\"And the pub across the road ran out of lager,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Ah, I.. err.. I'd still like to know who's running games.\" \n\"Well, I suppose we could run some remote desktop stats, see what's running and what percentage they're running.\" \n\"Excellent.\" \n. . . \n\"Smooth Boss-Keying,\" the PFY says once the Head of IT has departed. \n\"Actually a KVM switch. Press F12 and it switches to or from my Linux box.\" \n\"Useful,\" the PFY nods. \n\"Unless I've been perusing a PHO-TO-GRAPHIC site on the Linux machine and forgotten to exit the browser.\" \n\"Ah!\" the PFY says. \"I just configure my browser's home page to the OS2 discussion blog site,\" the PFY counters. \n\"Yeah, I think I'd rather be caught with the porn,\" I sigh. \n... Later that day ... \n\"So have you found the game players yet?\" the Head asks, looking a little bit harassed. \n\"Not really - we haven't connected to people's desktops remotely yet because it might be construed by some to be some sort of invasion of privacy.\" \n\"Nonsense! They're company machines and the company has access to the data on them. Anyway private data shouldn't be on home machines, not work ones!\" \n\"So we've got your permission to connect to people's machines?\" \n\"Certainly! And can you put a rush on it - I've got a meeting in half an hour to show a few of the Directors.\" \n\"Show them what?\" \n\"The... ah.. statistics.\" \n\"Oh right,\" I say dubiously. \"You want the statistics, not a list of game players for you and the Directors to creep up on till you find one poor bastard bending the rules?\" \n\"It's not like they weren't warned! We have to be seen to be fair and determined, no exceptions.\" \n\"They won't do it,\" the PFY says. \"They're all P&V.\" \n\"P&V?\" \n\"Piss and Vinegar,\" I explain. \n\"Like the crisps,\" the PFY adds. \"They won't do anything.\" \n\"I... u.. They will!\" the Head of IT says. \"It's company policy now!\" \n\"So if the list happened to have my assistant's name on it you'd have no hesitation in firing him?\" \n\"What?!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"If he were caught playing games it would be out of my hands,\" the Head sighs. \n\"So you're basically making us company axe men?\" \n\"Oh for Pete's sake, it's only one person. There must be someone in the department you don't like who plays games!\" \n\"Ok, we'll have a look.\" \n. . . \nThe world of executive promotion is a funny business. Within the hour I'm a stand-in Head of IT as well as a stand-in Boss as well as a Systems admin. Course the Head of IT did claim that he didn't play games, but the game of Spider running on his desktop (uncannily similar to the one running on the PFY's screen) when the Directors arrived was fairly damning. The porn they discovered when the boss closed that was pretty much the last nail in the coffin. They didn't even make it to the OS2 blog… \nCourse, explaining the game of Wolfenstein Enemy Territory they'll all be running Monday week will be another matter....

One sugar in my coffee is more than enough!\" \n\"Be back in a jiffy,\" Michael replies, bless him. \nHaving ones own PA does have its benefits and I'd be remiss in not commending Michael for his devotion to the tasks at hand. Whether it's filing important yet damning reports in the shredder, block booking meeting rooms so that the only possible venue is the pub across the road or simply stopping a bullet for me when a vendor calls, Michael has proved himself invaluable. It's almost a shame to destroy him. \nStill, he does know too much - and trying to outbastard a bastard can be rather career limiting. \nMy suspicions were aroused when I noticed that his handling of the 100+ page report into “questionable” content on fileservers (commissioned secretly by one of my predecessors) didn't seem to result in a change in the level of shredded paper in the rubbish bag as I'd expected. A later test document printed on colour paper didn't result in the appearance of coloured paper in the bag either, so I'm treating the issue as low-grade mutiny. A quick rifle through his desk while he was out reveals that he's logging my arrival and departure times with the obvious intention of presenting it as evidence in a review of my performance. \nSigh. \nThat said I may as well drink deeply of the cup set in front of me before the inevitable workplace accident, so I set about giving him the tasks that any manager gives any staff member who shows signs of having initiative. \n\"What sort of tasks are you talking about?\" the PFY asks, when I fill him on the treachery. \n\"Overseeing the recording - in quarter hour intervals - of the time spent by each employee on their various projects,\" I reply. \n\"Ooh, I hate that!\" he responds. \"It just ends up being a greater work of fiction than the timesheets. What else?\" \n\"I'm getting him to implement pointless security initiatives.\" \n\"Long passwords and password complexity?\" \n\"Partly that, yes, but also the typical inane suggestions that managers want people to implement because they read about it somewhere.\" \n\"Not...\" \n\"Yes! Paper recording of root\/administrator access, one time password pads stored in a special safe. No suggestion is considered too stupid!\" \n\"Nasty,\" the PFY says, shaking his head. \"But won't that just affect us?\" \n\"No. And yes! I plan on putting Michael in charge of the safe combo, then changing it when he's not looking - which should be exciting.\" \n\"Smooth,\" the PFY concurs. \"Is that it?\" \n\"Well to pass the time I am doing the all-time hated occupation of new managers...\" \n\"Incompetently commissioning reports on topics that no one gives a rat's arse about!\" the PFY replies. \n\"Yes, but also...?\" \n\"Repeatedly widening the scope when they're almost complete?! You bastard!\" \n\"Yes. My plan is to drive him nuts before he can gather enough evidence to have me fired or imprisoned. And if that doesn't wo...\" \n>tap tap< \n\"Sorry to interrupt,\" Michael chirps. \"Here's that report you wanted on people who use their middle names as passwords.\" \n\"Their middle names, or their wife's middle names?\" the PFY asks helpfully. \n\"Good point!\" I say \"Best do their wives as well.\" \n\"I'm sure no-one would us...\" \n\"Never Assume,\" I say sagely. \"That just makes an ASS out of U.\" \n\"And ME,\" Michael adds. \n\"I thought we just mentioned you?\" \n\"I...\" \nThought so. ACTUALLY, here's a thought, why not make it first names as well as middle names! \n\"Shouldn't that be a separate report?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No I was thinking that INITIALS would be a separate report, because it's not names as such. And Phone numbers.\" \n\"How about we just combine all the reports into one?\" Michael suggests. \n\"It's a good idea in theory, but there are so many variables, you know - like floor wax.\" \n\"Floor wax?\" \n\"Yes, I was reading in a magazine where floor wax can reduce the build-up of static electricity - or was it increase? - and I was thinking perhaps you could wax the tiles in the computer room with various waxes and produce a report on which is least likely to cause static electricity - but that doesn't really fit into the passwords report.\" \n\"Isn't static caused by a combination of man-made fibres and movement?\" \n\"They'd like you to think that, but secretly it's probably just floor wax.\" \n\"Although that idea about man made fibres would make interesting reading,\" the PFY prompts. \n. . . \n\"...and he came at me with a stapler!\" the PFY blurts later to security. \"But luckily I happened to have one of those tazer guns which I was.... uh.. repairing for a friend.. uh.. in the security business.. and I can see why it needed repair - I think it scrambled his brains a little.\" \n\"Perfectly justifiable force in the light of the situation though,\" our security bloke concurs. \"I'll have him and his stuff chucked out onto the pavement.\" \n\"Unfortunately he may have some confidential information in with his personal items,\" I say, as Michael comes around. \n\"So we should check it?\" Security asks. \n\"Nah, just take it all up onto the roof and torch it.\" \n\"!\" Michael sobs. \nWhat a pity. Now I'm going to have to get my own coffee - unless... \n\"Do us a favour will you?\" \n\"Get stuffed,\" the PFY says. \nWell, it was worth a crack. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.

Take the PFY for instance, who's as lucky in love as Grace Kelly is at cornering. Sure, he can semi-regularly win Spider with four suits but he still can't manage to hold onto a woman between pay cheques. \nIt can all be a bit depressing for the lad and as both a bystander and a friend I feel obliged to help him out in his time of misery. \n\"GET HARD YA BIG JESSIE!\" I shout, playing the tough love card. \"You don't see me moping around the place like a Mac geek at a TechNet gathering!\" \n\"That would be because you and your missus are still seeing each other,\" the PFY whines pathetically. \n\"Now, now, you have no proof that the break-up was anything but an ordinary relationship that had simply run its course. Sure, she does spend a bit of her free time with her supervisor, but there's no reason to put two and two together and come up with 69. There may be a perfectly logical explanation for her absences.\" \n\"Sure,\" the PFY says, not believing a word of it. \n\"Look, you're just being paranoid!\" I say. \"There's a bound to be some perfectly innocent reason for her spending time in her boss' company.\" \n\"Oh yeah, and what's that?\" \n\"I'm putting my money on it being work hours - when she's supposed to be at work?\" \n\"Yeah, it's all a little too bloody convenient!\" he snaps. \nI can see that I'm going to get nowhere with the PFY and that this is some deeply ingrained upset that may need some special handling. \n\"Ok, before you get a little too off tangent have you done all the normal post-mortem relationship things?\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Run conversations back through your mind looking for warning signs, replayed old arguments looking for the straw that broke the camel's back or rifled through her email looking for the confirmation of a hotel reservation - by the hour?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Right, so you've done all that - and there's no actual evidence?\" \n\"No, but that doesn't mean...\" \n\"Doesn't mean you're not being a little paranoid. Tell you what, why don't we get an expert opinion?\" \n\"Who?\" \n\"The other half - she's bound to know what's been going on.\" \n. . . A couple of calls later . . . \n\"Ok, so the PFY's got a little problem in love and he'd like you to diagnose what may have caused the problem, and whether his ex is actually seeing someone else.\" \n\"Uh-huh,\" Karen says. \"So what happened?\" \n\"She just said she didn't think it was working out.\" \n\"When?\" \n\"Monday morning.\" \n\"And you didn't talk about it the night before?\" \n\"No, I was playing on the PS2.\" \n\"Ok, but what about in the weekend\" \n\"I was at the Robot Destroyer challenge most of Saturday, and Sunday I was helping cleanup after the Robot Destroyer challenge.\" \n\"Ok, when was the last time you talked to her?\" \n\"Thursday night.\" \n\"And what did you talk about?\" \n\"What she should pick me up at the curry house on the way home.\" \n\"And you didn't talk when she got home?\" \n\"I WAS EATING A CURRY!\" \n\"What about after the curry?\" \n\"I'm not sure; I was trolleyed by then because I'd had 10 beers to get the vindaloo down.\" \n\"Right. Okay, what about the night before that?\" \n\"Had a Phal - and 12 lagers. And some ice.\" \n\"And the night before that?\" \n\"She had some birds' night out and I had a Rogan Josh. And five lagers.\" \n\"Okay, well don't take this the wrong way, but I think I know what your problem is.\" \n\"Mmm?\" \n\"You're not getting enough Naan bread,\" I say, interrupting with the solution. \"More Naan, less heat, then you can save the beers for afters.\" \n\"Oh yeah!\" the PFY smiles. \n\"I WAS GOING TO SAY,\" Karen interrupts, \"that perhaps the problem is that weren't spending any QUALITY time with your ex, and any time you did spend with her you were drunk or asleep - neither of which are attractive in a partner!\" \n\"I...\" the PFY says in his defence. \n\"She has a point,\" I say. \"So what I think you should do, is send her some flowers.\" \n\"Uh-huh,\" Karen agrees. \n\"Apologise in person the next day...\" \n\"Mmmm.\" \n\"Say you've been a fool and perhaps you should start things on a clean slate...\" \n\"Yes...\" Karen adds \n\"And if she stoops to allow you a second chance you should shower her with gifts, attention and quality time so that she realises that you're a diamond in the rough and that she really is lucky to be with the new you.\" \n\"YES!\" Karen nods approvingly. \n\"Then you dump her like the Boss-shagging piece of trash that she is!\" \nSo it IS true what they say about being lucky in computing but unlucky in love. Something my testicles will be reminding me of until well after Karen's cleared her stuff out of my gaff then trashed the place - as an example to others... \nSigh. ® \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.

It seems in his first week he's detected that someone is intercepting his email!!! The PFY and I are, of course, morally outraged at the thought of all this and assure him we'll leave no stone unturned in ensuring it doesn't happen again. \nWe'll be much more careful next time, for a start. \nUnfortunately our heartfelt assurances are not enough to appease him, and he's called in some ex-colleague to trace the source of the spying - and he wants us to cooperate fully, or else! \n“But how did he know?” the PFY asks when we're back at Mission Control deleting log files and erasing backup tapes. \n\"You've got me,\" I respond, but I did notice he's got a USB key with more fruit on it than a pile-sufferer's bum! \n\"Yes, I saw that too,\" the PFY replies. \"Wouldn't look too out of place plugged into the Tardis.\" \n\"Hmm. So we'll need to take a quick shufti at it.\" \n\"Doubtful - he takes it with him wherever he goes and his machine locks when it's not plugged in...\" \n\"Right, so we'd need to create a situation where he has no time to think...\" \n\"Like a small building fire?\" the PFY says. \n\"I was thinking more along the lines of sorting him out a dodgy curry and breaking all the toilets on this floor - but fire's a good idea too.\" \n... The next afternoon, after a large vindaloo, a castor oil mango lassi and small bin fire ... \n\"So what is it?\" \n\"No idea,\" I respond. \"But it's very advanced. I plug it into this machine and it does nothing - yet the coil indicates a mass of electronic activity inside it, which suggests that it requires network connectivity or some other activator. All other tests I've performed on it electronically imply that it's a passive device.\" \n\"But it's not?\" the PFY says. \n\"Doubtful. Tell you what, I'll check the wireless bandwidth for anomalies while you give it a sturdy bang with this hammer... Ok?\" \n>BASH!< \n\"Well?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Well what?\" \n\"Was there any change in network bandwidth?\" \n\"No, I just said that to get out of the way when you hit it in case it had some form of self-destruct device.\" \n\"You B...\" \n. . . \nStrangely, the disappearance of the Boss' key causes no outcry although I notice it is replaced the next morning by one on an elastic cord affixed to the Boss' belt. \nNot only that but the ex-colleague of the Boss has shown up as well, and he's what we in the trade refer to as an odd one. (And coming from someone in the computing trade that's fairly damning). \nNot mincing words he gets straight down to business: \"So I'd like to get access to all your sendmail and Exchange logs, audit records for computers and administrative access to your domain.\" \n\"I don't know that that's possible - nor wise,\" I start, playing the bluff card first. \"Besides, are you even sure that his email was seen - or is it just paranoia?\" \n\"Oh I'm sure,\" he responds. \"The device plugged into the USB port is an implementation of an extremely advanced form of encryption that we're working on.\" \n\"Really? And you'd be?\" \n\"I'd rather not say\" \n\"And the advanced form of encryption you're talking about is...?\" \n\"I'd rather not say.\" \n\"So it's Quantum Computing?\" \n\"I never said that!\" \n\"And you work for the Government - and probably not ours?\" I ask, the Boss' expression telling me everything I need to know. \n\"I never said that either.\" \n\"And you're some advanced form of geek for the project?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"So to go off on a tangent - you'd appreciate an extremely advanced form of one-time-pad encryption if someone just handed it over to you?\" \n\"I... What are you suggesting?\" \n\"Say for instance someone gave you an advanced form of encryption - for all intents and purposes unbreakable, with a potentially huge key length.\" \n\"I... I'm listening,\" our friendly spook says. \n\"Ok, How about this for a one-time pad - your DNA?\" \n\"My DNA?\" \n\"Yeah, it's a huge key, one time thing, excellent for encryption. Toss away all the predictable parts, keeping the remaining elements.\" \n\"But why mine?\" \n\"Doesn't have to be yours, it could be anyone,\" I say, nodding at the Boss. \nThe Boss smiles appreciatively at the thought of being a mainstay of a country's security. \nAnd what happens when a third party gets hold of his DNA?” \n\"Depends on the start vector and traversal method you use. Besides, you'd just have him killed.\" \n\"What?!\" Casper asks. \n\"Well, he already knows too much... Or you could just keep him locked away somewhere - like a loony asylum.\" \n\"This is ridiculous!\" the Boss blurts. \n\"It's a National Security issue!\" I respond. \"Then there's your parents...\" \n\"My Parents!?\" \n\"Yeah, well, why take the risk - I mean they're the two large probable-prime factors of the large probable-prime product that is you. \" \n\"I...\" \n\"Admittedly you're one possible outcome of your parents, so you might want to keep them on ice somewhere as well for when you need a new key. And it'd be a breakthrough in public key encryption - you just need two people to have a quick shag to ensure private communications.\" \n\"You're proposing that you use people to produce PKI vectors!!!\" Casper gasps. \n\"Ok, you could do it with animals I suppose, but I still think you'd find that the Boss here would be invaluable to your research. And with a modest royalty system for my assistant and myself to ensure complete secrecy you could perfect the science while the rest of the world is in the starting blocks.\" \n\"Uh...\" Casper mumbles, thinking. \n\"You'd have to take him away now of course,\" the PFY adds, nodding at the boss. \n\"I...\" \n\"And probably remove any record of his existence,\" the PFY adds. \"I'd torch his house and office to be on the safe side.\" \n\"I... don't think that would be a good idea,\" the spook says, fingering his cellphone and rolling his eyes at the Boss. \n... Later that afternoon after a small office fire ... \n\"Has anyone seen the new bloke?\" the Secretary asks, wandering in to Mission Control. \n\"What new bloke?\" \n\"Your new manager!\" \n\"We haven't got a new manager!\" \n\"I...

I know because the Boss, the new Head of IT and the CEO have been speaking earnestly behind closed doors for some time... \nNo sooner have I alerted the PFY to the situation than the phone rings. \n\"Dreamytime Escorts!\" I answer. \n\"Sorr.. I... What?\" \n\"Systems and Networks.\" \n\"Oh.. I.... Could you come into the meeting room for a moment please - no need to make a fuss.\" \n\"Sure.\" \nWith a summons like that one almost feels obliged to attend. \n\"We need you to go back through some mail and check that it was sent!\" the CEO asks \"Is that possible?\" \n\"Sorry, are you suggesting you want us to... ...intrude on someone's privacy and read the contents of their Sent Items folder?\" I ask, horrified. \n\"They don't work here any more so I'm sure it's ok,\" the Boss adds. \n\"Still, don't you think it might be a little... wrong?\" I say, possibly overdoing it a little. \n\"It's important. It seems that one of our people might have said something which may , if interpreted in the wrong way, have an impact on the company's standing.\" \n\"Insider trading?\" I ask hopefully, mentally kicking myself for not paying more attention to the dullards in trading... \n\"What? No, no, nothing like that.\" \n\"Then what?\" \n\"I'd rather not say.\" \n\"I'm going to need to know what to look for...\" \nA brief series of non-verbal communications later it's decided to let me in on the secret. \n\"It's... a... delicate matter which must remain confidential.\" \n\"You can trust me,\" I respond caringly. \"Mother is the word.\" \n\"Well it seems that in an unguarded moment one of our ex-board members may have used the company email system to allude to the sexual preferences of a board member of another company, resulting in the threat of legal action.\" \n\"Oh, is that it?\" I ask disappointedly. Just deny the message was ever sent.” \n\"They have a copy of it which they forwarded to us,\" the CEO replies tersely, handing over a printout. \n\"No, they have an electronic representation of some text which may or may not have been sent through our mail system. In fact, I'm almost certain this message ID will turn out to be that of a message sent to me at my home address.\" \n\"Really?!\" \n\"In ten minutes it will be.\" \n\"Oh. So there's nothing to worry about?\" \n\"Well there'll be a bit of name calling, but it'll be their word against ours.\" \n\"Oh good,\" the CEO burbles. \"But I think we should take steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.\" \n\"Hear hear!\" the Head of IT blurts, getting in some good anal-nasal interfacing while the Boss nods vacantly. \n\"What are you proposing?\" I ask. \"Putting a breathalyser on keyboards which can detect when someone's a little... uh... 'tired and emotional'?\" \n\"No, I mean blocking messages with anything offensive in them,\" the CEO says. \n\"Offensive?\" \n\"Yes, anything that might be construed as offensive, harassing or libellous.\" \n\"So... uh 'rude' words?\" \n\"Yes - stop them getting in or out for a start!\" \n\"What about colloquialisms which might be construed offensive?\" \n\"Sorry?\" the CEO asks. \n\"Things like 'Queer as a lemonade sandwich',\" the PFY says helpfully. \n\"I... Uh... Suppose so.\" \n\"What about chutney ferret?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I...\" \n\"Crafty Butcher?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"What about...\" \n\"LOOK, I'm not going to vet expressions!\" the CEO snaps, interrupting the PFY's recall of the more homophobic portions of Roger's Profanisaurus. \n\"So what you want is for us to install something like Mail Marshal to restrict the content of email, etc?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Or we could just save a bit of cash and write one ourselves - because I don't know that we could trust third party software to recognise the subtleties of the Queen's English,\" the PFY suggests, pointing to a section of the offending email which may or may not be alluding to an odd use of a domestic appliance. \n\"I see what you mean. Well, use your best judgement.\" \nWith those words in a parallel universe a locker bearing the name \"Pandora\" creaks open... \n. . . One day later . . . \n\"TURN IT OFF!\" the Boss shouts. \n\"But it's working!\" the PFY snaps. \n\"It's bloody not, it's blocking everything!\" \n\"Everything offensive,\" asserts the PFY. \"It uses Bayesian filtering and learning to build up blacklists of words - it's very advanced!\" \n\"I can't send anything to anyone! ALL my messages are getting rejected.\" \n\"Because the filter recognises your address as one which has offended a number of people.\" \n\"Who? HOW?\" \n\"Well let's see.\" >clickety< \"Ah-ha! Your first hit was in a message to me, using the word 'bloody' which has a score of five. That in itself isn't offensive, until you used the word 'shit', which is 80 and meant an instant rejection.\" \n\"Where?\" the Boss asks, as the PFY brings up the message concerned. \n\"I didn't say shit, I said 'fini sh it '.\" \n\"Sneaky, but we noticed it anyway.\" \n\"Are you suggesting I did it on purpose!?\" \n\"Of course. I was dubious till the filter highlighted the word serving, its dictionary meaning, the links to subservience, the link from that to submissive and from there to leather gags and male bondage.\" \n\"What? Are you serious?\" \n\"Not as serious as the people in personnel.\" \n\"YOU COMPLAINED ABOUT ME TO PERSONNEL!\" \n\"Of course. I don't see why I have to take that deliberate abuse.\" \n\"You slimy little basta...\" \nIn the parallel universe the sound of Pandora's locker slamming shut is simultaneous with the sound of a rather nasty slap being landed on the PFY's mush and the shout of the HR bloke who's just walked in to tell him not to be such a git. \nNow THAT is timing...

If we replace the seal and recharge the smoke it'll probably be as good as new.\" \n\"What are you talking about?!\" \n\"Your machine.\" \n\"I know you're talking about my machine but what's all this crap about smoke recharges!?\" The Boss snaps irately. \n\"Okay, your machine gave out a bit of smoke and died - yes?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Which is why I suspect the smoke seal on one of the chips has gone, letting out the smoke and causing the machine to fail.\" \n\"Which smoke seal?\" \n\"I don't know yet, I'll have to test the chips.\" \n\"Test them for what?!\" \n\"To see if the smoke's got out.\" \n\"What the hell are you talking about, there's no smoke in chips!\" \n\"What?\" The PFY asks in jus the right tone to imply doubts as to The Boss' sanity. \n\"Computer chips - they don't have smoke in them!\" \n\"Ah\" I weigh in. \"I think you might be a little mistaken - most microelectronic devices have smoke in them.\" \n\"Rubbish!\" \n\"Course they do!\" \n\"Ridiculous!\" \n\"Well how do you think electronic devices work then?\" \n\"They're collections of transistors..\" \n\"And how do transistors work?\" \n\"Silicon junctions?\" The Boss responds, slightly unsettling me with his in-depth knowledge. \n\"Some are silicon, some are germanium. But they're not pure silicon, because it's not actually conductive.\" \n\"nyyeeess\" The Boss says slowly, indicating that we're (thankfully) at the outer regions of his knowledge. \n\"So an impurity is introduced to the silicon to make it a partial conductor.\" \n\"Mmmm,\" The Boss says, verging on the mental depletion zone we call Dummy mode. All I need now is a little gate voltage to his mental mosfet and... \n\"And the addition of an impurity is called doping and the dope we're talking about in this case is managerium, a very very dopey compound\" \n*** DUMMY MODE ON! *** \n\"Managerium?\" The Boss repeats doubtfully. \"I've never heard of it.\" \n\"I'm not surprised,\" I respond, pullstarting the bullshit generator \"Whilst it's extremely commonplace extraction of pure managerium is extremely rare. It is one of the last elements in the periodic table and with an atomic weight of 347, it's extremely dense.\" \n\"Uhh... huh...\" The Boss mumbles, indicating that his mental \"bag full\" light is on, only I can't stop because I'm on a roll. \n\"So the silicon is doped with Managerium in a process known as superdoping to make the basic junctions required for microelectronics. Superdoping involves the fusion of managerium particles onto a silicon wafer in microscopic amounts.\" \n\"YES YES, I SEE, BUT WHAT THE HELL'S THIS GOT TO DO WITH SMOKE!?!!\" \n\"AS I WAS ABOUT TO SAY,\" I continue. \"The microscopic amounts are achieved by superheating managerium so that it changes from a solid directly into a gas - a process known as sublimation.\" \n\"Managerium being well known as a subliminal material,\" The PFY adds, stealing my in-joke. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And so when the smoke seal in a chip breaks the Managerium is free to break it's covalent bond, resulting in a gas which looks - because of Managerium's denseness - like smoke.\" \n\"So when a computer has smoke coming out of it, it's really Managerium escaping?!\" The Boss asks \n\"Exactly?\" \n\"Is the gas harmful?!\" The Boss gasps. \n\"Uhhh....\" I say, haltingly. \n\"What is it?\" he gasps again. \"I may have inhaled some - I certainly smelt something!!!\" \n\"Well the good news is that if you're affected by it you'd never know as it affects the mental system - although it IS a cumulative poison.\" \n\"Well what are the symptoms if it's bad?\" \n\"I... I'm not sure. I know you get headaches.\" \n\"Headaches?!\" The Boss blurts, grabbing his forehead. \n\"Increasing amounts of Amnesia is another symptom. It starts out with small things and just gets worse and worse.\" The PFY adds. \n\"How much worse?!!!!\" \n\"Well, advanced cases forget everyday things like the names of people they just met, license plates of cars they used to own, their dreams, the last thing they read before they put a book down at night - that sort of thing - but I mean that's only the really bad cases.\" \n\"Bloody Hell,\" The Boss gasps, rushing from the room gripping his head tightly. \nThe ambulance was overdoing it a little, but he did insist after I \"remembered\" that inability to concentrate was an indication of a near fatal dose of the material that had an atomic weight of 347 which was actually almost same as a combination and Uranium and Silver both noted for their relative paucity in conjunction with quartz deposits in the African subcon..... \n\"So do you think we should replace the faulty power supply?\" The PFY asks, pointing past the fan to the huge scorch mark where a capacitor used to be \n\"Nah, chuck it in the bin.

I catch a brief murmur of brain damage and manage to spit out something about it being his normal operating mode... \n\"What happened?\" the PFY gasps once the pushing and shoving has stopped. \n\"I...\" the Boss blubs, before lapsing into shocked silence. \n\"I...\" I say, coming to a halt when I realise I have no recollection of what's transpired. \nor... It might be a dream but I seem to remember... \n. . . \n\"IT'S NOT THE BLOODY SAME!\" I shout, annoyed. \"I ordered a PARTICULAR machine in a PARTICULAR configuration so that it can perform a PARTICULAR task!\" \n\"But this machine is the same,\" the Boss responds, calmly. \"See, everything in the same amounts. It's a perfectly good substitute.\" \n\"You can't substitute a machine with a fast processor for a crap machine with two much slower processors! When I order a machine with two hard drives I don't want a machine with one LARGE hard drive!!!\" \n\"If I may,\" the PFY says, interjecting. \"I think I see the root of the problem.\" \n\"Mmm?\" the Boss and I say almost simultaneously. \n\"You think the systems are basically the same.\" \n\"They are,\" the Boss says. \n\"Only you're not paid to think. If you were you'd be getting paid a lot less.\" \nFIGHTING TALK FROM THE PFY!!!! \n\"I beg your pardon?!!\" \n\"As well you should - this isn't the first time. Last week I ordered a couple of replacement mice for the console system and instead of the five button optical jobbies I ordered I got a FOUR button trackball - one with a ball which isn't even bloody spherical.\" \n\"But the ones you specified were 30 quid each. The alternatives cost us a tenth of that!!!\" \n\"THEY DON'T BLOODY WORK PROPERLY!\" \n\"But they've saved money!\" the Boss bleats. \n\"YOU DON'T SAVE MONEY IF IT'S DODGY!\" the PFY snaps. \"And then this morning I receive this...\" \n\"It's a keyboard.\" \n\"Yes it is. A PC keyboard with a Dec-VT220 configuration. NO-ONE USES THEM ANY MORE!\" \n\"But it was only five quid!\" \n\"BECAUSE IT'S CRAP!\" \n\"Has this been happening with all our orders?\" I ask, looking suspiciously at the recently delivered, yet still unopened package on my desktop. \n\"Uh... We have an agreement with stores that if we can find an equivalent for less or a better item for the same price we should do that. And the stuff they get is perfectly reputable and not at all... dodgy.\" \n\"And the person who's deciding what an equivalent product is the same person who picks his nose and eats it to save on lunch money?\" \n\"He's saved us thousands already!\" \n\"So it HAS been happening with all our orders?\" \n\"Yes. Didn't we... uh.. tell you about that?\" the Boss asks, faking innocence. \n\"So when I open up this package I'm not going to find the Taser.... uh... Insulation Testing Device I ordered?\" \n\"You might. Or it might be a perfectly workable substitute.\" \n. . . \n\"THIS ISN'T WHAT I ORDERED!!!\" I snap angrily as I open the package and find a box with strange lettering on the side. \n\"No, it's a 'better' model\" the PFY says, looking at the box. \"East European. Higher voltage - unlimited battery life - at least that's what I think it says.\" \n\"East European?\" the Boss asks confusedly. \n\"Yes...\" \n\"Would you care to revise your story about dodginess?\" I ask the Boss... \n\"No, I'm sure it's an excellent substitute.\" \n\"Well\" the PFY says, scanning the pictures. \"It looks like you turn it on here >click<, put the safety link in here >HUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM< and you control the withdrawal of the carbon rods here...\" \n\"Carbon rods?\" I ask, stepping back slightly as the ready LED goes from dull to bright red, then to white, then off with a puff of smoke. \n\"Does uh... anyone else smell burning?\" the Boss asks, backing away slightly. \n\"Still think it's not a bit dodgy?\" I ask the Boss. \n\"...and it looks like,\" the PFY continues engrossed in picture translation, \"it's activated by pushing this button over h...\" ® \n"}

In that case tell him not to worry - it's illegal in this country too,\" I say, handing my helper the 50 quid he'd been promised before he dashes out the pub door. \n\"What the hell did you do?\" \n\"Oh Nothing. He just helped me dump a bit of rubbish.\" \n\"The new auditor guy!!\" The PFY gasps. \"I thought he was sniffing around the place a bit too much for his own good...\" \n\"What?! No! No, it was just some old laser printers from the clutter in Mission Control. The environmentally-friendly disposal crowd have upped their prices again so that it's getting cheaper to buy a printer than dispose of one!\" \n\"You didn't stuff them into the roadside bins again!\" the PFY sighs. \"It's a 50 quid fine!\" \n\"They way things are going it'll soon be the cheaper option - but no. We just chucked them off Waterloo Bridge.\" \n\"What?! How'd you get them there?\" \n\"'Borrowed the Boss' car.

Hitting the party barge was a bit of a low point and seemed to upset the punters, but by that stage we were in the car with the foot down.\" \n\"And there'll be no.... complications?\" \n\"Nope!\" \n. . . The next day . . . \n\"Ah... Uhhh... Simon. Was wondering if you had time for a little chat?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Sure gimme five minutes - I've almost got spider beat!\" \n\"Ahhmmmm, it's a little more urgent than that,\" he mumbles, looking a little distressed. \n. . . two minutes later in a quiet meeting room . . . \n\"Right. Well. It seems that Miss Watson here...\" the Boss says, indicating a woman in the room with us. \n\"Ms,\" Ms Watson corrects. \n\"Ms?\" the Boss confirms. \n\"Short for Misery?\" I ask, lightening the situation a touch... Or not, as seems apparent. Ah well. \n\" Ms Watson is a legal representative of an ecological group - 'Friends of the Thames'.\" \n\"Ah yes, The Thames Freighter, a king among vans!\" \n\"No,\" Ms Watson snips. \n\"Really? You're friends of the Television company then?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"The Tunnel! A tribute to Brunel!\" \n\"No, the Thames river!\" she snaps. \n\"Oh, of course. And?\" \n\"And Ms Watson believes that a number of our company's older computing assets found their way into the Thames last night.\" \n\"Really? By themselves?\" \n\"I think we can dispense with the innocent act,\" Ms Watson says, placing a photograph on the table. \"Amazing the clarity of these pictures, don't you think? I think the courts would have no problem at all in prosecuting you on this evidence alone.\" \n\" THIS 'evidence' alone?\" I ask. \n\"One of the machines had a company inventory sticker on it,\" the Boss sighs. \n\"Which led me here.. to you\" Ms Watson says. \n\"It's true\" , I admit grudgingly. \"While taking the machines for... servicing.. the car .. broke down on the bridge, at which time a man appeared from nowhere and started tossing them into the Thames. Some form of Luddite, I shouldn't wonder!\" \n\"You're suggesting you weren't a knowing party to this?\" \n\"Of course not. Your photos clearly show me attempting to rescue the printer from him - and I defy you to prove otherwise.\" \n\"We have several similar photos from two separate occasions last night.\" \n\"He's obviously a serial offender,\" I suggest. \n\"And you're also suggesting that your car just HAPPENED to break down at the same place twice in the same night.\" \n\"Classic cars are notoriously unreliable.\" \n\"And so you're saying that you weren't intentionally dumping your old equipment into a public waterway.\" \n\"We're the VICTIM here!\" I blurt, not altogether convincingly. \n\"And you don't mind telling me how you do dispose of your equipment?\" \n\"We work on a 30-month life cycle.\" \n\"Don't you mean 36 month in line with the normal three year warranty?\" \n\"No, 30 month. At that point we remove the theft prevention device and inventory stickers and redeploy them closer to the car park. Things seem to sort themselves out there because people can't resist the opportunity.\" \n\"So it's your contention that you have no inventory disposal problems?\" \n\"None.\" \n. . . twenty minutes later. . . \n\"Well thank you for coming to share your concerns,\" the Boss blurts, showing Ms Watson to the door. \n. . . \n\"I thought we were for it then!\" he gasps when he returns moments later. \"I think you'd best let your offsider know that we'd rather pay the disposal fees than risk public exposure for dumping equipment - especially the stuff we've yet to dispose of.\" \n\"No, no, there's nothing left.\" \n\"What about the two machines on the floor of your room.\" \n\"Should be leaving the building in the boot of Ms Watson's car any time now.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Which reminds me - when she comes back to complain let me know as we've got a bootload of dud toner cartridges in the basement looking for a home....\" \n\"I...\" \n\"...think we're doing a splendid job and deserve an afternoon in the pub.

No, I've not seen him all day. Or yesterday for that matter.\" \n\"Is he sick?\" \n\"I doubt it. When you're a contractor you don't waste good contract money being ill at home. No, I'm not sure where he is. Hang on...\" \nI bash the PFY's mobile number into the desk phone. \n\"Hmm, phone's off or outside a service area. I'll try his home phone.\" \nI bash another number in. \n\"... Nope, his phone just rings. Which is strange, because I know he has an answerphone with the same message as the Lithuanian embassy.\" \n\"I.. Why?\" \n\"I don't know, maybe they need a backup.\" \n\"Well anyway, I just popped in to see if he'd helped my mate Algy out.\" \n\"Algy,\" I ask, suddenly interested. \"As in Algernon?\" \n\"Yes, why?\" \n\"It's probably nothing.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Do you know about the Echelon Project?\" \n\"Oh - the one where we're putting a new plasma screen in the boardroom for company presentations?\" \n\"No the SIGINT project run by the NSA to capture the world's communications.\" \n\"Oh yes, I have heard something about that.\" \n\"Well a couple of years ago a bloke put a post onto the web identifying Algernon - not Algy - as the first of the three words in the ' find-me ' code.\" \n\"Find me?\" \n\"Yeah. So you're a modern day James Bond and get caught. All you need to do is get to a phone, ring any non-local number - but by preference an international call to a country of particular current interest. As soon as the call is made you say the three word phrase and then hang up. Echelon will find the phrase, send up a rocket to say someone's in trouble and before you know it you're surrounded by white vans.\" \n\"White Vans?\" \n\"Windowless white vans to be precise.\" \n\"?\" \n\"White vans are the black helicopters of urbanity.\" \n\"?\" \n\"They're everywhere and no-one sees them.\" \n\"Well that's not entirely true - everyone sees them. There was even one in my parking space a few days ag..\" \n\"I see,\" I nod. \n\"But they were delivering office supplies! I saw the paper!!!\" \n\"So when you say 'they' you mean more than one? Why would it take more than one person to deliver office supplies?\" \n\"I... But why would they be interested in your assistant?\" \n\"They're probably not - but they're most certainly interested in how he came by the find me codes.\" \n\"Didn't you say they were posted on the web?\" \n\"No, the guy was going to post them one day at a time to avoid detection but he never posted the next one!\" \n\"You mean.... they... got to him?!!!\" \n\"Who knows. He might be at the Guantanamo 'holiday resort' or he might have just got bored.\" \n\"But you're suggesting that somehow your assistant may have inadvertently set this thing in motion by talking to my friend.\" \n\"Or by mentioning it in a phone conversation along with the other two words of the find me phrase.\" \n\"Do you know what the other two words might be?\" \n\"I'd can only guess that they'd be uncommon words - words that wouldn't ordinarily appear in normal conversation. Like Strom Thurmond, for instance.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"A joke. No, it'll be words which could be used together but ordinarily wouldn't.\" \n\"Like 'Fix Algernon's Computer'?!!!!?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"No, that would be too common and it would need to be more obscure than his machine.\" \n\"Well it's not his computer, it's his god-daughter's.\" \n\"NOW we're getting warm! Algernon, god-daughter and I'm guessing something to do with computers.\" \n\"Yes but what?!\" the Boss asks. \n\"Who knows, it could be anything. Why are you so keen to know?\" \n\"Well what if I've said accidentally said it too?!!!\" \n\"Trust me, if you'd said it you'd already be in a dark room wrapped in carpet with a hose up your bum.\" \n\"WHAT!?!\" \n\"If you'd said it, you'd be gone already. The only thing you've got to worry about is if the PFY doesn't talk and they start running phone calls from the building back throught Echelon. You used a payphone to talk to him didn't you?\" \n\"WHY THE BLOODY HELL WOULD I USE A PAYPHONE TO TALK TO A MATE ABOUT A DODGY COMPUTER!?!\" \n\"Yes I think that's your best approach, because sooner or later the PFY's bound to finger you - figuratively of course.\" \n\"WHAT!?\" \n\"Well, it's only a matter of time till he cracks.

How do you plan to do it?\" \n\"I'm not - I'll get the PFY to do it - he can sniff a breast out of a hard drive at thirty paces.\" \n\"I don't want porn, I want the business info!\" \n\"Yes, yes, but the PFY will break into the machine to get the porn and we can get the other stuff.\" \n\"What if he hasn't got porn on his machine?\" \n\"Puleese.

Yeah, you and Ghandi - because he's dead.\" \n\"I don't.\" \n\"Really well just to be on the safe side, do you want the PFY to check your machine? Even deleted files! He can suck a thumbnail out of a two-month-old deleted zip file...\" \n\"I don't think that will be necessary,\" the boss counters hastily. \"So what sort of software does he use?\" \n\"Software?!\" the PFY asks \"Oh! Yes... uh... software.\" \n\"You don't use software?\" \n\"It's like a sixth sense\" I explain to the Boss. \"Someone a couple of rooms away visits www.DirtyNunHosemonsters.com and he's straight into the webcache to grab copies\" \n\"Really?!\" \n\"Oh yeah. But he's got some quality control problems. He can detect porn but he can't detect what kind of porn - which can be a little disturbing at times. For instance last week when one of our part timers discovered a fetish for geriatrics.\" \n\"I'll never look at a rumpled mattress the same way again,\" the PFY whimpers. \n\"He'll probably need counselling,\" I whisper to the Boss. \"But meantime, that's not getting us into the box.

I mean you'll have to boot from a CD...\" \n\"Yes, and then?\" \n\"That's pretty much it.\" \n\"So he'll have got into the machine?\" \n\"I'm not too sur...\" \n\"Got it!\" the PFY says, popping back into the room cheerfully with a pack of smokes in his hand. \n\"Excellent!

So you start play at 7pm?\" \n\"Yes that's right, 5pm\" \n\"Fiv... Oh. Are you in a clan?\" \n\"Clans are for people without lives,\" I blurt without thinking. \n\"Or handbrakes,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Handbrakes?\" \n\"Social handbrakes - the little woman. You know - well you probably don't - but the person that stops you from playing shoot-em-ups over the net till three in the morning.\" \n\"I... So can anyone join in one of these games?\" \n\"Anyone still standing at five after 10 pints!\" the PFY responds magnanimously. \n\"I think I'd like to give it a crack!\" the helldesker blurts. \n\"Of course you would!\" the PFY says, smiling happily. \n. . . 5pm that day . . . \n\"RIGHT!\" I slur. \"Time to go, where's my office keys?\" \n\"Where's the helldesk geek?\" the PFY counters. \n\"Where's the door?\" the helldesk geek responds. \n\"Best get a move on, only quarter of an hour till they lock the lifts down.\" \n. . . just over quarter of an hour later . . . \n\"Bugger, they've locked the lifts down!\" \n\"Yeah, but we left the pub 16 minutes ago.\" \n\"What? The pub's only across the road! That was never 16 minutes.\" \n\"Course it was, check your watch - you're thinking in drunk time.\" \n\"Drunk time?\" the helldesk geek asks. \n\"Yeah, you know, you decide to walk home from the pub and get there in just under 10 minutes - drunk time. Meanwhile the rest of the household who LEFT THE PUB AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME BUT GOT IN A CAB have been tucked up in bed for the last three hours. Which means that either cabs are time machines, or...\" \n\"Being drunk makes time go by faster?\" the helldesk geek slobbers. \n\"EXACTLY! It's a theory I've been working on for some time - usually after I've been drinking, like now. You know how relativity means that time isn't constant for a moving objects?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Well it does. Einstein proved it. AND it's also tied up with the effects of gravity somehow. Well the same thing can be said for a drunk object - for whom time appears to travel much faster AND the effects of gravity are negligible.\" \n\"Eh?\" \n\"You know how when you're sober and you drop a brick on your foot and break your toe?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Well when you're drunk, that never happens. It's only the next morning when you wake up on a traffic island in the nude that you find you have a broken toe. Which tends to indicate that gravity doesn't work as fast when you've been drinking - because you're travelling so fast, in drunk time.\" \n\"I don't th...\" \n\"Ever noticed how you can't catch a ball, throw a dart or jump over stuff properly when you're boozed?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"That's drunk gravity for you.\" \n\"Tell him about the people,\" the PFY nudges. \n\"What people?\" \n\"Because you're travelling in drunk time and moving so fast, conversations get compressed - because of the Doppler effect.\" \n\"M?\" \n\"It's technical. Anyway, because of the compression and expansion people don't understand what you're saying.\" \n\"Oh, I...\" \n\"And because you're travelling so fast and with the compression and Doppler effects and everything, really really good jokes get dragged out in their minds and so you tell them the best joke in the world and they're just standing there - because to them it seemed like the joke took half an hour to tell.\" \n\"Because...\" \n\"Because they're travelling at different speeds. So whereas in rapid drunk time you tell them a quick joke which is the funniest joke in the world and the whole pub thinks you're fantastic, in the morning no bastard is speaking to you because apparently they THINK you told the receptionist she had a fat arse and called the PR guy a big poof. Because of the distortion of compression. Course their memory is distorted because we drunk people are doing and saying things faster than their mind can commit it to memory so they remember it wrong.

HR2 : This afternoon at the pub? HR3 : Yep, I'm free. HR1 : Don't want to talk about Promotions? HR2 : Nup. HR3 : I'm good. HR1 : >sigh< \nCEO : That sounded like a bit of a rough meeting. Helldesk cannon fodder who will die in the next scene : Yes, the users ganged up on the IT people about server performance and the proposed 'standardised desktop' plan. CEO : And what happened? Helldesk cannon fodder who will die in the next scene : It seems that the Manager of Systems put the user up to it but the whole thing turned to custard when that Bastard guy happened to stumble upon some evidence of the Manager in question stealing large amounts of the company's stationery. And shagging the head of IT's missus. CEO : So the standardised desktop plan's still a goer then? Helldesk cannon fodder who will die in the next scene : Oh yeah. \nHR1 : So anyway, what about these promotions? A position's opened up in IT. HR2 : Promote from within you think? It's not really for us to say. HR3 : Schtum - Here's some now. \nEnter Bastarde and PFYe \nBOFH : What a bastard of a day. First that crap meeting now we're on bloody smoke alarm repairs! HR1, HR2 & HR3 : Morning. BOFH : (whispered to PFYe ) Promotions committee. Be Nice. (loudly) Morning ladies. How are we this morning? HR1 : Good, but not as good as you by all accounts. HR2 : Putting in the spadework with the CEO's standard desktop idea... HR3 : Climbing the greasy pole then? BOFH : Huh? PFYe : Everything all right here? HR1 : Ah, the assistant. HR2 : Lesser than the bastard and yet greater. PFYe : Ay? HR3 : Ignore her. She's a parttime dietary consultant. BOFH : What the hell are you talking about? HR1 : We're suggesting you're a megalomaniac corporate ladder jockey with a penchant for workplace homicide. Bound to get places fast and leave a few smoking corpses. BOFH : Ah, so nothing libellous then. \nEnter Helldesk cannon fodder who will die in this scene \n>KZZZZzzzzzerrrt!< \nBOFH : Woopsy. \nCEO : So the Systems Manager's gone then? Head of IT : He was on the street before his personal possessions made it to the furnace. CEO : Sorry to... ah... hear about the wife. Head of IT : What? That?! It was the worst photoshop job I've ever seen! CEO : So how are you going to replace him - promote from within? Head of IT : What, you mean the Bastard? No, we've tried that before, it never works out. CEO : Perhaps this time... Head of IT : Suit yourself, but you'll regret it. \nBOFH : Would you bloody look at this contract! PFYe : Hmm? I thought you'd said you'd never do that again. BOFH : Yeah, but look at the bottom line! PFYe : You earn more than that now. BOFH : I think you'll find that's a monthly amount, not annual. PFYe: WHAT! That's crazy money! BOFH : Yeah well - it seems the pay is average but the workplace hazard allowance is astronomical. PFYe : Makes you think, doesn't it? BOFH : About edging out the CEO, nabbing his role with the skilful application of bribery and blackmail then leading a full frontal attack on the US arm of the company for multinational control? PFYe : No, I meant about the benefits of being a contractor. BOFH : So are you in? PFYe : What do you want me to do... \nCEO : Awfully nice of you to invite me down for a couple of drinks. BOFH : Not at all. Another brandy or three? CEO : Don't mind if I do! PFYe : So what's your interest in this standardised desktop business. CEO : Well between you and I... (pauses to down one of the three newly delivered large brandies) PFYe : (Moving the flower on his lapel closer) Yes? CEO : I have a old school friend who deals in computer imports and between us we've set up a company to onsell the equipment the company needs at a reasonable profit. (slurring slightly) And, as I control the budget for a purchase of such magnitude the review process will be relatively short... PFYe : ...and sweet? CEO : Indeed. PFY : Excellent. Another brandy or three? CEO : Don't mind if I do! \nPFYe : (washing hands and rinsing his jacket) Who'd have thought the old man to have had so much sick in him? There's a spot. Out damn spot. BOFH : (entering) Dog problems? PFYe : No, the CEO didn't make it to the bogs and barfed down my back. Then he dropped his watch down the toilet and is trying to get the landlord to shut the toilets down before it gets washed into the sewer.. \nHR1 : So what are you having? HR2 : Gin. Make it a double. HR3 : Me too. HR1 : (Turning to landlord) So that's double, double and... (Reading sign on blackboard behind landlord's head) you've got toilet trouble? BOFH : Afternoon ladies, can I get you three a drink? Thanks for the heads up about the promotions opportunities too. With a bit of luck I could go all the way to the top! HR1 : And bear in mind that none of woman born will stand in your way. BOFH : Eh?! HR1 : We've been here for two and a half hours, you're lucky we're standing... \nEnter Bastard and PFYe , looking pretty pleasede with themselves \nBOFH : So it's sorted then, the CEO's down the road faster than an insider trader, the Board's in a shambles and I, as a whistleblower with the company's best interests at heart, am in a perfect position for a takeover. And, if the HR druids are to be believed my application for the top role is a shoe in. PFYe : Well it would be, but... BOFH : What? PFYe : The new HR Appointments Process auditor looks a lot like Louise Brown... BOFH : Oh shit. The bastardes!... ® \n"}

He even promised his oldest son that one day he would inherit a peerage. \nBut the impostor's cover was blown after checks by the Passport Agency revealed he had stolen the identity of Christopher Edward Buckingham, an infant who died aged just eight months, in 1963. The ruse was copied from one employed by the assassin in Frederick Forsyth's novel The Day of the Jackal . Unlike that character \"Buckingham\" maintained an unremarkable life working as an IT security consultant for a Swiss insurance firm since 2001, The Times reports . \nBuckingham's passport was revoked in 2003. He was arrested in January after checks by an alert immigration official in Calais showed he was traveling under fraudulent documentation. Buckingham was allowed to travel back to the UK but was arrested by police as soon as he docked in Dover. \n\"Buckingham\" was charged with making a false passport application and pleaded guilty to the offence at a hearing a Canterbury Crown Court last month. He has steadfastly refused to reveal his true identity despite the added risk of a jail term this might bring. He told his former wife that his parents died in a plane crash in Egypt in 1982, shortly before the pair met in Germany. The couple divorced in 1997. \nDNA and fingerprint checks on Buckingham have drawn a blank. Strict privacy laws in Switzerland have hampered checks in the country, where Buckingham is believed to have a safety deposit box. Buckingham owns a house in Northampton and is not short of a bob or two but little else is known about him, least of all his true identity. \nPolice hoping to uncover Buckingham's true identity have released a picture of him, taken in the '80s, to the media in the hopes that someone might come forward to identify him. ® \n1 The title of Earl of Buckingham has been extinct since 1687 after the death of the second Duke who \"had a reputation for debauchery and killed his mistress’s husband in a duel\" , The Times reports . \nAnd, yes, we know a Duke, a Baron and a Lord are not neccessarily the same thing. But in the Vulture Central style book, alliteration comes before aristo. \n"}

Or you could have asked the PFY.\" \n\"Oh I was on holiday too,\" the PFY says, bringing up the rear. \"But he signed my leave form as well.\" \n\"That's uncommonly generous of you, letting us both off at the same time!\" I say, turning to the Boss. \"Now how do we get into our office?\" \n\"It's not your office any more - we took on new Systems people when you abandoned the workplace.\" \n\"Abandoned the workplace?

Every decision counts and you know that you can't afford to take time off to smell the roses. More importantly, you can't take time to go to the bog - even if your bladder feels like its the size of a medicine ball and filled with hot gravel - because that would be your biggest mistake... \nThe table waits silently for the PFY to speak while around it sits myself and a couple of other system admins we've often negotiated several pints with. On top of the table is a reasonably substantial amount of cash in notes, coins and IOUs, and beside it a manky old duffel bag destined to carry home someone's winnings... \nAs first light touches the roofs of the buildings outside, the PFY finally croaks out a sentence. \n\"Miss Secretary... in reception.... with the Cat-5 Cable,\" he says. \n\"SHIT!\" he says, as I show him my Cat-5 Cable card, obliging him to add yet another 20 quid to the pot. \nAround the table some feverish scrabbling takes place as people update their complicated whodunit matrices... I, meantime, roll the dice wordlessly and advance my counter towards the Comms Room, pausing only to put five quid into the pot. \nCharlie (not his real name - in fact I don't even know his real name) to my left rolls the dice and moves his counter to Reception. \n\"The Bastard, in the Comms Room with the Cable Ties!\" he says triumphantly. \n\"You have to be in the Comms Room to make an accusation in the Comms Room,\" the PFY snaps testily, no doubt feeling the effects of missing his sleep and toilet breaks. \n\"No, you can make an accusation in any room - you just have to be in a room!\" he responds. \n\"Not in this game,\" Charlie's offsider (who may or not be Ted) says. \"You have to be IN the room.\" \n\"Shit,\" Charlie says, dropping a 20 into the pot. \nAround now everyone realises that the Comms Room is the place to be, AND why I wasted three turns to roll a six to lock the Computer Room door behind me. Ted's roll brings him to the Computer Room door and he barely has time to drop his five quid in the pot before the PFY snatches the dice up and rolls. \nI might be over reading this but the tapping of the PFY's counter as he moves from Reception towards the Computer Room does seem a bit aggressive than usual. He drops his five quid into the pot wordlessly and hands me the dice. \nA quick five later and I'm in the Comms Room, poised for Victory. \n\"THE BASTARD, IN THE COMMS ROOM, WITH THE COOLING PIPE!\" I cry happily. \nShoot me down in flames if I'm wrong but do I see a glimmer of a smirk on the PFY's face as he reveals his Cooling Pipe card? \nI drop my false accusation 20 quid into the pot and contemplate the work of genius that is my personally designed cross referenced chart, running through all the possibles and impossibles. \nCharlie's next move only brings him three moves closer to the Computer Room and five quid closer to Bankruptcy, while Ted rolls a six on his first attempt unlocking the Computer Room door and, in his bonus roll, gets another six, then a five, bringing him into the Comms Room with me. \n\"You could've locked the door,\" I murmur uncharitably. \n\"Why bother?\" he asks, smiling broadly, \"because we all know it was THE BASTARD, IN THE COMMS ROOM, WITH THE FAULTY POWER POINT!!!!!\" \nA quick round-robin of the table seems to prove his point and he digs amongst the winnings to get to the envelope. \n\"And the nominees are...\" he chuckles, as he one by one reveals the cards within, \"The Comms Room, The Bastard and The Faulty Power Point. GENTLEMEN, IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE!\" \nWhile Ted's forcing down a victory pint the rest of us dash to the Gents, noticing as we do that the sun appears to be up and that it's about an hour till work time. \nSigh. \n. . . about 2 hours later in Mission Control . . . \n\"I still can't believe you missed it!\" the PFY chuckles. \"I showed you the Cooling Pipe card in your first guess.\" \n\"Yeah I must have forg..\" \nMy response is cut short by the arrival of the Boss with a long list of complaints and grievances that he's chosen to address today, of all days, when I'm tired, slightly inebriated and broke. \n>CLONG!< \n\"Don't tell me,\" the PFY says as I help the groggy Boss back into Mission Control. \"THE BASTARD, IN THE COMMS ROOM, WITH THE COOLING PIPE\" \n\"Which only goes to prove you can't be wrong every time,\" I say, nodding cheerfully. ® \n"}

But surely you'll just recover it from backup? I mean there's not a lot I can do.\" \n\"We'd like you to replace the disk he dropped,\" I say, kindly. \n\"?! It's working isn't it?\" \nSigh. \n\"It's working now,\" I say slowly. \"But its lifetime is likely to be severely shortened by the mistreatment, which means it'll probably fail in a couple of months - or hours - instead of a couple of years.\" \n\"Well firstly the company would want proof that our engineer dropped the drive - which I'm guessing you don't have, but secondly the drive's actually working so I can't replace it - there's nothing wrong with it!.. uh... Sorry.\" \n\"Ok, lets put it another way. You can order a disk now, have it couriered here and spend a couple of hours lazing around having coffee and biscuits, or you can leave now and have to come back in a couple of hours to replace the failed disk.\" \n\"It might not fail within a couple of hours!\" \n\"Trust me - it will!\" \n\"You'll void your warranty if you damage the disk!\" he blurts. \n\"As if we would!

The sound seems so familiar and yet still so elusive, and for some reason I just can't put my finger on it... \nAs the sounds seem to die away (die being an all too appropriate term in this case) the penny drops - someone's shut in the tape safe!! Ordinarily this wouldn't cause me the concern that it otherwise should, however another fistful of pennies drop when I realise that the PFY didn't okay any 'lockin' with me and... ... ...it's been a reasonably long time since I saw the PFY.

I COULD HAVE BEEN HOURS!\" \n\"So you do care?\" the PFY sniffs. \n\"Of course I do. I'm expecting a package of DVDs from Amazon and I wouldn't trust any of the bastards out there to check the packaging is intact!\" \nAnd just like that the situation goes from being a simple workplace misunderstanding which could have lead to a slow lonesome death to being something the PFY is going to hold a grudge about. Anyone would think that I'd planned it - anyone in this case being the PFY. \n\"It was an accident - it could have happened to anyone!\" I say. \n\"Accidents don't just happen, they're caused,\" the PFY says, repeating one of the primary tenets of Bastard Operatism. \n\"Yes, yes, but this was just a genuine misunderstanding,\" I say, realising that I'm going to have to watch my back for the next little while. Six months should do it. \n\"Where's my pen?\" the PFY asks, scrabbling round amongst the rubbish on his desk in an annoyed manner. \n\"I dunno. Were you using it in the tape room?\" \n\"No!\" \n\"Here, use this\" I say, throwing over the pen I'm using. \n\"THAT'S MY PEN!\" \n\"That's a pen, I'll grant you, but it could be anyone's.\" \n\"No, it's mine, I file a little mark at the end so I can recognise them.\" \n\"Oh, right\" I say, foregoing the opportunity of a long and impressive diatribe about the sadness of people who feel it necessary to take to a piece of disposable stationery with a file. After all it would only make things worse, and I'm really a people person. Or something. \n\"You stole my pen,\" the PFY snaps. \n\"I may have borrowed your pen.\" \n\"You stole my pen from my desk, where it lives ,\" he replies. \n\"It's... just a pen.\" \n\"But it's not just a pen is it?\" the PFY snaps. \"It's a .5mm roller ball in off blue - a very unusual colour. I had to order it specially - which I'm sure you knew when you shut me in the safe!\" \n\"Wait a minute - you're suggesting that I shut you into a safe to provide me with an opportunity to steal a pen that's worth about the price of an average cappuccino?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"Instead of just ordering a box load of them for the department at no cost to myself?\" \n\"I know how your mind works. Locking me in the safe saves you the hassle of paperwork\" \nSo tell me, you didn't happen to knock over a bottle of madness serum when you were in the safe did you? \n\"Tell you what I'll do. RIGHT NOW, I'll ORDER you a whole box of those pens which you can use to your heart's content without worrying about being on someone's hit list. IN FACT, I'll even pay for them myself.\" \n\"Believe it when I see it,\" the PFY says. \n\"Chuck the pen over so I can get the part number.\" \n\"Oh you'd like that wouldn't you?\" the PFY says from his position right up against the verge of insanity. \n\"Ok then, WRITE THE PART NUMBER DOWN and I'll order you a box,\" I sigh. \nThe PFY scribbles down a part number and I get an internal order form out. While writing out the form I take the PFY's point about the unusual nature of the blue in his pen. It's almost cerulean. And the width of stroke is that much more impressive than the .4, but not quite as chunky as the .8. Thinking back the ergonomic design of the pen was quite pleasing in a... \n\"So did you finish putting the sliders into the tape safe?\" \n\"I could hardly do it in the dark!\" \n\"So that's a no then?\" \n\"It'll be done before you've finished ordering the bloody pens!\" the PFY says, stomping off. \n\"Excellent!\" I say, screwing up the order form, grabbing the PFY's pen and following him into the tape safe room... ® \n"}

It could be the impending arrival of relatives, the promise of presents or just the knowledge that for a short space of time you're free of the horrors of the workplace. Whatever it is, the workplace becomes a much nicer place to work and people often put aside their petty differences in the spirit of goodwill. \n\"We can't call it Christmas any more,\" the HR Droid says, reading from his memo. \"From now on it's got to be called the holiday season.\" \n\"Why?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Because not everyone celebrates Christmas. It's not PC.\" \n\"So the non-Christmas lot will be working through then?\" \n\"Well, obviously not. It's a public holiday!\" \n\"So this is a cake-and-eat-it-too situation then?\" \n\"I... don't want to go into it, that's just the way it is. Now... uh... the next point is that if you're participating the five quid anonymous present thing you must adhere to the five quid maximum.\" \n\"Eh?\" \n\"Last year one of our traders donated an overly large present 'because he earns so much more than the normal participant'.\" \n\"..which made everyone else feel like fried dogs balls on toast?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"I think he meant that it probably made the other people feel bad,\" I say, interpreting. \n\"It did. And it's not to happen again!\" \n\"Tell you what, why don't you leave that item with us to bring up - as a Christmas treat to you.\" \n\"I... Well ok then, thanks!\" \n. . . \n\"So which trader was it?\" the PFY says, scrolling through the directory. \n\"Brown,\" I say, fingering the name on the screen. \"He gave an espresso machine.\" \n\"I... That is excessive!\" \n\"Yes, but it goes nicely with my toaster - I had to X-ray everything for security reasons.\" \n\"So he knew it was going to you?\" \n\"He may have been under the impression that it was going to the young woman in accounts he was having a clandestine relationship with at the time, but I'm sure he felt better about it when she dumped him after getting the five pairs of running socks...\" \n\"And you think it'll happen again?\" \n\"He does appear to be spending a large amount of his time receiving stationary selection lessons from the temp in the supply cupboard...\" \n\"We've got a temp in the supply cupboard!!!!\" the PFY sniggers, just before a surge of voltage surges through his frame. \n\"So,\" I snap as the PFY recovers his faculties. \"We need to get to work. Now how do we stop him buying something excessive?\" \n\"Ask him?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"No.\" \n\" Tell him?\" \n\"No.\" \n\" Threaten him?\" \n\"No. No we need to remove the urge to splurge\" . \n\"Steal his money?\" \n\"He's a trader, they don't have any money.\" \n\"Steal his credit card!\" \n\"Getting warmer...\" \n\"Oh...\" the PFY says, handing me the phone. \n>clickety< >click< ... \n\"Hi, systems and networks here,\" I say, speaking to Mr Brown. \"We've got a problem with your username and I was wondering if you'd be so kind as to logout and log back in again.\" \n\"Sure,\" he burbles, tapping away quickly. \".... Wait, No, I can't!\" \n\"Yes, as we thought, it's a problem with our network but I'm AFRAID you're going to have to come down here in person for us to change it - rules and all that.\" \n\"Okay, well I suppose I can't work without it.\" \n\"Always the way,\" I sympathise. \"And if you can bring a couple of forms of ID with you too.\" \n\"Sure\" ... \n. . . ten minutes later . . . \n\"Ok, so here's your drivers license and credit card back,\" the PFY says, handing back a substitute he crafted earlier, \"and if you could just select a four-digit PIN number on the keyboard over there which you can use to automatically verify yourself if you ever need to get support over the phone again.\" \n\"Oh, ok, >tap< >tap< >tap< >tap<\" \n\"And once more to lock it in.\" \n>tap< >tap< >tap< >tap< \n\"And you did make sure not to use the same PIN number as any other service?\" \n\"Oh... uh... yes!\" he lies. \n. . . two minutes later . . . \n\"Yes, I'd like to increase my credit limit,\" I say, once the formalities of the credit card number and expiry date are out of the way. \n\"Certainly\" the professional young woman at the end of the line says \"And if you could just type in your PIN number...\" \n>tap< >tap< >tap< >tap< \n\"...no, I'm sorry, that's not working.\" \n\"Backwards,\" the PFY mouths silently. \n\"My mistake, I'll try again,\" I say tapping away. \n\"Excellent.

Uhh... that's not what I have here!\" \n\"Course it's not, I usually make one up - what with the connotations and all...\" \n\"I... see. Well, I suppose if you know your PIN... What limit would you like?\" \nI go for gold and pick an excessive number out of thin air. \n\"Uh.. I thought you said you wanted to increase your limit?\" \n*BONANZA* \n\"Oh of course, I was thinking about the price of the car I was thinking of buying my girlfriend - how about you just double the limit?\" \n\"I'll just see... >clickety< .... Annnnnnd that's been accepted. Is there anything else I can do for you?\" \n\"Can I update my emergency contact details - you know, the number you call if you notice a drastic change in spending behaviour?\" \n\"Sure...\" \n... 30 seconds later... \n\"...and is that all I can do for you today?\" \n\"Can you tell me where the nearest money machine is?\" \nThe rest of the day is a bit of a blur, ending up at a bar so posh the toilet lollies are menthol flavour. \n\"Just one more 30-quid-a-glass cognac!\" I say to the PFY. \"I sense we're on the edge.\" \n\"I can't. I can't do it,\" the PFY slurs, sliding off his chair onto the floor. \n\"Don't do it for me, do it for the company! Do it because it's bloody Christmas!\" \n. . . Early the next morning . . . \n\"I'm sorry sir, your card has been declined!\" the Posh Barman says. \n\"Thank goodness,\" the PFY gasps. \"Can you call me a cab?\" \n\"Of course sir - you're a cab.\" \nDrinking all day and most of the night, hearing a good dry joke from a barman then getting the crap kicked out of you because the PFY landed a right hook on a bar stool - now THAT is priceless. ® \n"}

Sure, it's deader than a dead thing on a bank holiday and anyone with a life would be doing something else, but this is where the year is prepared for... \nFirst job is cleaning up the debris in the cafeteria - which is quite a task after several cases of anonymously donated cheap bubbly arrived on the premises on the last day and were immediately consumed by the staff, resulting in a bit of... untidiness. \nOnce that's done I abuse my heightened level of access to the building to snaffle all the personal and company digital cameras I can find, putting each in it's own carefully labelled brown envelope. \n... \n\"What're they for?\" the PFY asks, scaring the crap out of me in the all but abandoned building as I sneak back into a darkened Mission Control. \n\"What are what for?\" I ask, slipping the bag of cameras behind me. \n\"The bag of cameras behind your back,\" the PFY says, tapping the CCTV console feed. \nBugger, I'll have to make him an accomplice... \n\"It's... my annual incriminating evidence gathering mission.\" \n\"?\" \n\"Every year there's a Christmas party and every year people do some inadvisable things.\" \n\"So?\" \n\"In the past some of these things were lucky enough to be recorded on the CCTV system, but in these days of biometrics and enhanced burden of proof the leverage of a poor quality black and white image isn't what it once was.\" \n\"Oh I'm fairly sure the authorities could base a case on what I've recorded this morning...\" the PFY hints. \n\"Be that as it may, I'm after bigger fish. Last year I left disposable cameras in strategic places in the hope that they'd be used to capture 'magic moments', but I was sadly disappointed.\" \n\"So you're stealing people's digital cameras to make up for it?\" \n“No. They'll be returned to their place of origin once I've accessed the flash memory” \nFLASH memory being the operative word” the PFY comments, winking. \n... Half an hour later ... \n\"Well that was a bust!\" the PFY says, looking at the collections of images. \"Hardly blackmail material, is it?\" \n“Yes, well, finding incriminating evidence was the original plan but it occurred to me that with a bit of memory retardant the authenticity of reality could be challenged. \n“And translated into English this means? \n\"I realised that finding images was a crap plan. A far better plan would involve them finding incriminating images...\" \n“Yes but there aren't any” the PFY explains slowly. \n“I think you mean there aren't any yet .” I say, firing up Photoshop... \n“But they'll know they're fakes!” \n“No, they'll probably just hope they're fakes.” \n“What do you mean?” \n“In the week prior to Christmas I invested heavily in an end-of-line champagne substitute known by some as Château de legopener, sending several cases to the Company under a pseudonym. I'm sure you witnessed the effects..” \n“So you're suggesting that most people won't remember what they did?” \n“I'm suggesting there might be a grey area or two which could be filled by an image or two from Doctor Bastard's Lab!!! ” \n“Will it work?” \n“Of course. I take all the images from the cameras >clickety<, feed them into the morph package, >click< add a bit of anonymous porn, select our... victim.. and Viola!” \n“Nothing happened!” the PFY says. \n“Of course not, it takes about two hours an image – but time well spent, I assure you!” \n. . . three days later . . . \n“I'm a little... disturbed by some images that were printed on our colour printer,” I say to The Boss. “Images, what images?” he asks – in a hunted tone. \n“Uh.. I'm not sure how you would describe them.. Candid snaps maybe? Only they look to have come from your workstation late in the afternoon on the 23rd....” \n“There's nothing on my camera,” he blurts. \n“I didn't suggest there was,” I counter. “Although one of them does feature you. Well, a part of you.” \n“Yes, yes, well just throw the print-outs away. Or actually I'll throw them away!” \n“Yeah, I could do that but the company has a policy about images of this nature – who to notify, how to gather evidence for the disciplinary process, etc.” \n“ Disciplinary Process! Surely it's none of the company's business,” the Boss blurts. “Can't you just.. pretend you didn't see anything?” “Oh, you mean act as if I hadn't seen you in the photograph – the same way you could act as if you didn't see the bottom line of the expenses claim I'm about to present.” \n“So we're talking blackmail?” \n“Really? I didn't notice one – although I wasn't looking too carefully. I could check the prints...” \nAnd just like that the Boss is a broken man, signing any form we put in front of him - It's almost too easy. While he's contemplating the possibility that he's been living a lie I make a quick call to ensure that the expenses claims will get processed in the next pay run. \n“I'm afraid the close-off date for the next run has passed,” the Accounts woman informs me. \n“Can't you make an exception for me?” I ask. \n“I don't think so.” \n“So it's only your Boss you make exceptions for – giving him his.... Christmas present early... so to speak. \n“What do you mean?” She asks, taking on the Boss's hunted tone. \n“I think you know. \n“I... \n“..think you can make an exception after all?” \n“I'll get right onto it” \n“Course you will...” \nYeah, it is too easy. ® \n"}

How much to you think you'll need?\" \n\"Well I'd like about 10 gig if I can?\" \n\"10 gig, that's a lot of space - are you sure you're going to need it all?\" \n\"I think so.

This report only came in this morning and, with the exception of this extract, has only been seen by the senior managers in the company.\" \n\"Yeah, we knew that, too.\" \n\"I find that rather unlikely. The results were collated by a top-flight company...\" \n\"... which completed the draft findings two days ago, OKed by their auditing and legal people yesterday, was printed and bound in the early hours of this morning, delivered around here by a motorcycle courier, registration plate LM...\" \n\"How can you know this?!\" \n\"We're Systems and Networks,\" the PFY replies, oozing smugness from every pore. \n\"The report was delivered to the front desk at 8:22am,\" I continue, \"received by Dave\" . \n\"Short Dave or Big Dave?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Short Dave.\" \n\"Oh.\" \n\"...and was collected by the CEO's PA - who, incidentally, was the brains behind commissioning the report - was read by her between 9am and 10am and summarised into three main points to fit the CEO's attention span by 10:20am.\" \n\"I...\" the Boss says. \n\"The CEO called the Head of IT about point two - the extremely poor rating of the Systems and Networks people - at around 10:40am; you were brought in at around 10:45am at which time the CEO unveiled the board's master plan to have a second, snap random survey executed in a couple of days, the results of which will be the basis for a round of dismissals at all levels of the company - no exceptions.\" \n\"It'll never fly!\" the PFY says. \n\"It will!\" the Boss blurts emphatically. \"The CEO's already talked a large management consulting website into interviewing random managers for tomorrow's article on pruning corporate deadwood. The plan's going to be mentioned there!\" \n\"Which managers?\" \n\"It's random - no one knows. So you'd better do something about raising your profile!\" \n\"Nah - People forgive and forget!\" \n\"You're the worst-rated people in the company, they won't forget that - You need a plan to improve your rating!\" \n\"Yeah, well, we had a plan to employ a stack of parking wardens.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"To create a 'buffer zone'. But then we realised it'd cost us money so we changed the plan.\" \n\"To?\" \n\"The same as the first plan, only we'd use insurance salesmen. It would cost less, what with commission-based payments and all.\" \n\"And I take it you've abandoned this plan?\" \n\"Yes, with plan three we realised that we need to distinguish ourselves as a 'cut above' average.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"Random acts of kindness, generosity above and beyond the call of duty, that sort of thing.\" \n\"I... don't know that it'll work given that you've only got three days...\" \n\" And it's lunchtime,\" the PFY interrupts as the second sweep hand hits 12pm. \n>EOC< \n. . . 11am, three days later . . . \n\"So how the hell did staying in the pub on a three-day bender help your case any?\" the Boss asks as we trundle into his office. \n\"We realised,\" I explain, \"that by limiting contact with the punters we'd stop our situation getting worse\" . \n\"But I thought you said you wanted to be a cut above average!\" \n\"We do!\" \n\"Well how'd that help?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"There are two ways to get to be above average,\" the PFY explains, raising a finger. \"One, strive to improve.\" \n\"Yes yes,\" the Boss says. \"And two?\" \n\"Lower the average,\" the PFY says, raising a second finger and gesturing. \n\"I... What do you mean?\" \n\"OK. Let's say finance got an anonymous tip-off that loads of people buy their mates meals and drinks and get them reimbursed under the guise of entertainment expenses and office sundries. As a result, the finance department rejects all outstanding expenses claims and actions an audit of all current and past claims, requiring people to produce receipts or else reimburse the company?\" \n\"Yes... that would be unpopular,\" the Boss says thoughtfully. \n\"That IS unpopular,\" the PFY says. \n\"Or security get tipped off that smokers are leaving the external fire doors open and, as a result, people from other companies are sneaking in for the free lunch buffet - resulting in a no-smoking ban for staff within 10 yards of the building and compulsory ID card checks before you can get your lunch.\" \n\"Oh yes, that is rather annoying,\" the Boss concedes. \n\"But the worst one would be the quote on that Management Website from one of the managers they interviewed, calling the staff... ahmmm.... \" I say, trying to recollect correctly. \n\"...a bunch of inbred hermaphrodite proles with the collective appeal of an unflushed toilet at a curry house,\" the PFY quotes. \n\"You're joking!\" \n\"No no, that's what it says on the website! You should have see pagehits on the company proxy server. I think everyone saw it!\" \n\"Well who said that?!\" the Boss gasps. \n... \n... \n... \n>knock knock< \n\"That'll be security,\" the PFY says nodding at the door. \n\"YOU BASTARDS!!! But how'd you know they'd talked to me!?\" \n\"We're Systems and Networks,\" the PFY sighs. \"It's our job to know...\" ® \n"}

Mind you, I'd never be on the course in the first place if the dates hadn't coincided with a major sporting event that one of our suppliers has a corporate box (with lashings of lager and small savoury treats) at. MmmMMmm sorted. \nSo of course I'm sporting a headache that measures 'Kurt Cobain' on the pain scale and instead of easing it with some hair of the dog I have to sit through the inane drivel of a man who knows as much about linux as Princess Grace did about mountain driving... \n\"And ls is what you use to list your files - ls being 'list' with every second letter removed\" the dweeb burbles. \"And you'll find a lot of unix utilities are similarly named - like cp for copy, mv for move\" \n\"And s u - for shut?\" I ask idiotically. \n\"No, s u is used to become root.\" \n\"Oh, so it's short for slut - not shut.\" \n\"No, no,\" he chuckles condescendingly. \" Su is short for substitute user.\" \nIf there's one person that gets on my tits , it's the person at a training course that thinks they know more than the tutor and continually adds their 10p worth into the conversation when it's not wanted. I realise that I'm in danger of becoming that soldier, but I can't help myself, this guy is just crap ! \n\"And ps which is used to...\" \n\"Find a list of the users that piss you off?\" I suggest \nI can't help it, I just can't help it. It's like I've lost control!!!! \n\"No, it's used to find a list of processes. Now as someone's already mentioned su I think we'll talk about that for a while. With the exception of, say, changing to the oracle user or similar, the majority of the time, su is used to become the root user. And the root user is a very special user with enhanced powers.\" \n\"Like X-ray vision\" I add quietly. \n\"Because of this\" he continues, ignoring me, \" root is used very sparingly and in the course of a normal day a good administrator is never logged in as root.\" \n\"Beg pardon?\" I snap. \n\"I said a good administrator is never logged in as root.\" \n>snap< \n\"Bullshit! A real administrator is always logged in as root - it's CRAP administrators that aren't!\" \n\"I think you'll find real administrators always use their own account and su to root\" he replies condescendingly. \n\"Pffft!\" \n\"So you use root all the time do you?\" \n\"Only for the past 20 years.\" \n\"And you're not afraid of accidentally removing all the files from your home directory?\" \nI used to be, but now I always do my work in someone else's home directory. \n\"But aren't you afraid you'll accidentally type in some command that would crash the system?\" \n\"No more that I'm afraid I'll accidentally say something like You're a complete fraud! \" \n\"That's completely different.\" \n\"Yes, it's a lot easier to say something without thinking than to type it.\" \n\"So you're saying you always use root rather than your own account?\" \n\" root is my own account...\" \n\"Well I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. It may be that some linux administrators are less concerned with their system security than others, but in my experience linux administrators are just as concerned as Windows and OS\/2 administrators about the ability of malicious software being downloaded and affecting the machine with enhanced privileges.\" \n\"Oooh, yes,\" I add. \"When I used OS\/2 I was very concerned about malicious software exploiting enhanced privileges.\" \n\"What, the ability to activate code which could destroy the operating system and data on it?\" \n\"No, my concerns were more along the line of it not setting the machine on fire and hammering a stake through the install media - apparently viruses can't do that,\" I sigh. \nAround now the tutor has probably realised that I'm one person he shouldn't hand a course evaluation form to at the end of the session, so he decides to move on... \n\"Ok, so I think it's about time we try a couple of the exercises, so if you could all login to the server with the username at the top of your worksheet\" \n\"You mean root? \" one of the other students asks. \n\"No, I mean the other username, above root\" \n\"It's not working for me,\" another student chirps. \n\"Or me.\" \n\"Or me.\" \n\"What about you?\" the tutor asks me. \n\"Oh bugger!\" I say. \n\"What?\" \n\"It seems you were right after all\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"About a silly typing error causing problems\" \n\"How\" \n\"Well I logged in as root earlier and I was just going to try that ps thing you mentioned, but instead I accidentally typed in 'nohup cd \/; rm -rf * > \/dev\/null 2>&1 &' \" \n\"Okay.\" he gasps, \"Just type in fg .\" \n\" fg , ok, oh bugger, I accidentally typed control-d instead.\" \n\"I...well, I suppose we could have a lesson on reinstalling a box from scratch,\" he sniffs. \n\"...or we could have one on gaining access to a corporate box at a major sporting event which has trolleyloads of lager and nibbles?\" \n>Cue tumbleweed< \n® \n"}

When the code failed to launch a year later because of coding flaw, Yung-Hsun (who survived a round of lay-offs) reprogrammed the malware to go off on his next birthday (April 23, 2005), according to a federal indictment unsealed in New Jersey this week.

Did I...I mean we get anything else? \n\"Uhmmmm,\" Cathy says, browsing through a large cardboard box beside my desk. \"Some bottles of port, a couple of posh corkscrews, and some tickets to a riverboat cruise, some calendars and a couple of...remote controlled cars?\" \n\"Did you say remote controlled cars?\" I gasp, suppressing what might otherwise have been an expression of excitement. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"They're here then?\" \n\"They're your cars?\" \n\" Technically they're mine and the PFY's because between us we made the company the largest purchaser of Serial ATA disks in November.\" \n\"But in reality...?\" \n\"I told him we missed out by five drives and what he doesn't know can't hurt me.\" \n\"I...So are you're just going to take them?\" \n\"Oh yes. And in my position I'm sure he'd do the same thing - after all It's CHRISTMAS!!!\" \n\"I see,\" Cathy says, watching the descent of man with disgust. \"And you're going to get them now?\" \n\"Uh-huh, while my assistant's otherwise occupied...\" \n\"Can you pick up my chocolate?\" she asks sweetly, handing over a large bucket. \n\"What's the bucket for?\" \n\"To carry 73 bars of chocolate.\" \n\"73 bars of chocolate?\" \n\"The packaging burst,\" she says. \"I think security took some, there was supposed to be 100.\" \n\"And the bottled water?\" I ask, pointing to the flagon of bottled water in the bucket. \n\"A bribe for security.\" \n\"Fair enough,\" I say, making for the lifts as soon as the coast is clear and the PFY's busy with Photoshop. \n... \nI can't help sparing a thought for Cathy's naiveté. I mean who'd entrust 73 chocolate bars to me? In fact, who'd entrust them to security!? Especially at Christmas! \nI'm still thinking these thoughts when the lift panel goes dead. \n...and the lift stops. \n...and the emergency light goes out. \n.. \nIt's only then that I realise that there are no chocolate bars - and by the time I get out of here, no remote controlled cars either. \nAnd then I realise what the bucket and water are for... \nAnd >rustle< that the PFY lifted my cellphone when he bumped into me... \nAnd that someone's removed the lift call button... \n... \nAnd then I start wondering if the lift camera is an infra red one or not - and if so whether the ensuing hours and what the entail will be all streamed live to the web... \n...because that's what I'd do. \n...because it's Christmas. \n"}

And locking me in a lift. And for us when The Boss, supposedly the victim of a convoluted photoshop inspired blackmail scheme, instead calls lift maintenance because he doesn't want to carry his presents down three flights of stairs. \nAnd so it is that I am free from my elevatory prison... \n... and seeking revenge. \nFirst stop, Mission Control - but The PFY has long gone. Second stop, the secretary's desk because it's more than apparent that the PFY and Cathy are acting in collusion - but she too has departed hastily. A brief ferret around her desk reveals nothing however a couple of moments thought (plus those hours trapped in a lift) have given me a plan... \nI dash off a quick email to Cathy, ostensibly ordering a batch of new paper-clips or something, and quick as a flash her out-of-office message pops back to say that she's off to Spain for a week and won't be contactable over the break. I shove a Knoppix disk into The PFY's machine and peruse the contents of his hard drive until I hit paydirt in his webcache. A set of transactions with an online travel agency. Interesting.. \nA further disk scrape or two reveals a deleted PDF file containing the e-ticket receipt and flight information including departure time - and joy of joys - it's not going to depart for another couple of hours! \nWhile the PFY and Cathy no doubt spend a couple of hours sampling the fare of a Heathrow drinking establishment I work a little magic on the airline's telephony server... It is criminal how little care and attention is paid to proper security on these machines. A quick rummage through the information therein gives me a couple of suitable names, numbers and locations. A few quick modifications later and I'm on the tube rattling my way to Heathrow... \nI get there about 10 minutes after the plane's departed, which suits me just fine. It's a timing game this - too soon and they'd never get on the plane and too late and it'll never work. I search for the public phone I'm after and bash out the first number I'm after, departure control.. \n“Hello?” \n“Hi Jim in baggage handling. We've got a burst case here and I need to know if the flight's gone?” \n“Which flight?” I'm asked without further query - given that the guy's phone caller-ID tells him I'm ringing from baggage handling. \nI blurt out The PFY's flight number, only to be told that the flight has just left. \n“We can let the owner know when he gets in. jJst tell me the barcode number,” Control says, helpfully. \n\"I can't,\" I sigh. \"The bag got caught in a conveyor mechanism and it's been pulled to bits. There's part of his luggage label though, so I can give you the guy's name?\" \n\"Sure, that'll do.\" \nI rattle off the PFY's name before going off onto a tangent about the unreliability of the model C17-A conveyor system and how they never should have replaced the Bristol 12s which were so reliable they actually used them in the first Gulf War to aid in the loading of munitions, etc., etc., etc., until the guy cuts me off. \n\"Okay, I'll send a note through to the other side letting them know and they'll tell the passenger when he arrives. Can you bag up the contents and send them on?\" \n\"Well that's the thing,\" I say, getting into the whole 'Jim' role. \"I can package up most of it in a 3T4 bag, although they're not as robust as the 3F4s but their cost per unit's about twice that of the 3T4, but we're not allowed to package drugs in transparent packaging...\" \n\"Drugs?!\" the guy snaps. \n\"Yeah, flu medication.\" \n\"Oh,\" the guy says, almost sounding disappointed. \n\"Yeah, it's just those anticongestant tablets - the ones they make poor-man's-Speed out of. There must be 10 cartons of them.\" \n\" TEN CARTONS! \" he gasps. \n\"Yeah, and condoms, lots of condoms. Although it looks like he's used about three packs of them, the lucky bastard!\" \nBefore Jim can tangent off onto the subject of the Spanish package holiday him and the little woman had back in '74, I'm put on hold while the guy has a quick chat on the other line to someone from HM Customs... \n\"Okay, that's all sorted, they're going to contact Spanish Customs, but they want you to get the bag up here, ASAP.\" \n\"You've got to be joking!\" I gasp. \"We're two men down and one of the C17-A's is on the fritz. I've rung a couple of the on call guys and I can probably get one of them to drop it off to you in about an hour or so...\" I say. \n\";Hang on... Yeah, they say that'll be OK -they'll hold the guy at the other end...\" ; \n\"Right then!\" Jim says, and I hang up and wander back to the Tube entrance. \nLooks like the PFY will be getting a little more sex than he bargained on this trip... ® \n"}

A time for striving onward in the pursuit of excellence and a time for putting behind us the upsets of the past year. Upsets like me getting trapped in a lift and having to spend several hours contemplating a bucket-based toilet system in full view of the CCTV camera... \n...And upsets like The PFY suffering the indignity of a cavity search so aggressive it took him ten minutes to walk properly and ten pints to get the taste of rubber off the back of his tongue... My getting his luggage 'lost' in Heathrow on the return leg 'because of fog' was really just kicking the man when he was down, but experience has taught me that if you've got to kick someone that's the best time to do it... \nStill, it's water under the bridge now and The PFY has agreed to bury the hatchet (Although as there's one in the building somewhere, I'm keeping my wits about me) and we've forged a truce in the spirit of the New Year. In fact, The PFY and I have made so much positive progress that we've made a New Year's resolution to even treat our callers better. And no sooner have we taken a suck on the peace pipe of double-espresso shots than one of our users calls us. \n\"Password problem?\" I predict as The PFY reaches for the hands free button. \n\"No bet,\" The PFY replies. \n“Hi there, I've just come back from holiday and I seem to have...” \n“...forgotten your password over the break?” The PFY suggests helpfully. \n“Yes – but only because that stupid expiry made me change it in the last week of work,” she snaps. \n“No problem,” the PFY says ignoring the sarcasm. “What's your username – I'll reset your password so you can change it when you log in.” \n“Can't you just set it to my normal password?” \n“The one that expired?” \n“Yes” \n“No, sorry, it's expired. But I could reset it and you can choose a new one,” the PFY says, \n“Couldn't you just unexpire my old password?” she says, firing up the old whiney interface. \n“Not really. Why not choose a password that's easy to remember, like the license plate of your first car?” \n“Oh I can't possibly remember that.” \n“The name of your favourite beer plus your year of birth?” \n“I don't drink beer.” \n“Of course not. The address you lived in when you were a kid, the PFY says, with just a touch of testiness. \n\"We moved around a lot.\" \n\"Your first boyfriend's name,\" The PFY seethes, really starting to lose the plot as far as password security is concerned. \n\"Ted - but that's too short.\" \n\"What about setting it to the reason that he dumped you?\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well 'difficult' is nine letters long and...\" \n\"Excuse me,\" I interject, before The PFY can suggest using the names he may have called her or concatenating the words pain-in-the-arse \"Why not set your password to a person's first name and their birthday. You must know someone else's birthday?\" \n\"I do... but wouldn't it be easier to just use my old password?\" \n\"Easier - yes, more secure - no. And we do like to keep you people safe from internet crime,\" I reply, using the old faithful excuse. \n\"Wouldn't it be better if you made our network more secure so that it wouldn't matter if we used the same passwords?\" she asks, twisting the problem around so it's our fault now... \n\"We could, but then the systems security would be so secure you'd spend half your time on the phone to us to give you access to it,\" I respond. \n\"Isn't that what I'm doing now anyway?\" she asks. \n\"Perhaps I should just mention at this point that while my assistant and I appreciate that liberal use of sarcasm may have served you well in the past, it's our position that we can't compromise the security of the company systems to save you the trouble of having to remember something new.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"And so I'm going to get my assistant to change your password to 'security' and have it expire when you login. Is there anything else we can help you with?\" \n\"I... no.\" \n\"Excellent, you should be able to login in a couple of minutes.\" \n>click< \n\"What time is it?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"9:13am.\" \n\"So, it's just another 359 days and about 7 hours to go. No problems. We can do it.\" \n>ring< \n\"Password Problem?\" I predict as The PFY reaches for the hands free button. \n\"No bet,\" he says as mentally prepares himself for the IT Support version of Groundhog Day. \n... \nYou know, I almost feel bad about offering a hundred quid to the person who can drive The PFY over the edge on the first day. But I did organise it before our truce, so technically my conscience is clear... ® \n"}

Strange the way things pan out. Take for instance the New Year's truce forged between the PFY and myself. On one hand we reached a landmark accord which allowed us to work in harmony with each other and the users and on the other hand I'm now locked in a dark basement room that the PFY tricked me into visiting by saying that the PR people's expensive new kit had been misdelivered there - all because he found out that I'd arranged for people to harass him mercilessly on the first day. \nI'd have explained to the PFY that this was all organised before the truce between us had been struck, only I was in a bit of a hurry to get my hands on the 25-inch LCD monitors that the PFY had said had just appeared in the basement... \nThe newly installed large electronic lock on the door of the room should have been a dead giveaway but the PFY had also mentioned in passing that he thought the monitors came with 5.1 surround satellite speakers and I may have been a little overexcited - which goes to show that I just don't learn from my mistakes. George Santayana would be ashamed of me. \nThe dodgy lighting in the room - which failed once the door slammed shut - also should have rung alarm bells but in my rush to the supposed new kit I didn't think about it. \nSo now I'm trapped in a room which is almost certainly been hand-picked by the PFY for the density of the concrete and remoteness from human contact... \nWhat would MacGyver do? \nUnfortunately I don't have the couple of rubber bands, alarm clock and six feet of galvanised drainpipe which he'd use to create a working masonry drill so I'm going to have to switch into geek mode. \nHmm... It's dark, I'm in a basement... ... \n>ADVENTURE MODE ON!< \nIt's pitch dark, and you can't see a thing. \n> I \nYou have: a small bag, a half consumed chocolate bar. \nThe bag contains: a lifebook p1000 ultraportable, a Philips head screwdriver, a flat blade screwdriver, a piece of wire. \nWhat I wouldn't give for a shiny brass lamp....

You have 6 hours of battery life remaining. \n> EXAMINE DOOR \nThe door is made of solid wood with steel reinforcing. The steel looks new. The backplate of a large electronic lock is embedded in the wood. \n> UNSCREW BACKPLATE \nThe backplate cannot be unscrewed. \n> EXAMINE HINGES \nThe hinges are the high security, autoclosing welded pin type. \nThe bloody PFY thinks of everything... \n> LOOK \nYou are in a small room with concrete walls, floor and roof. \nThere are some empty wooden computer crates here. \nYou have 5.45 hours of battery life remaining. \n> EXAMINE WALLS \nThe walls are made of steel reinforced concrete and are very thick. \n> EXAMINE FLOOR \nThe floor is made of steel reinforced concrete and is very thick \n> EXAMINE ROOF \nThe roof is made of steel reinforced concrete and is very thick. There is a thermal fire detector on the roof. \n> HIT DETECTOR \nYou can't reach! \n> STACK CRATES \nThe crates are now stacked in an easily climbable pile. \n> U \nYou are at roof level. There is a thermal fire detector here. \n> HIT DETECTOR \nWith what? \n> HIT DETECTOR WITH P1000 \nYou hit the detector with your lifebook, partly to damage it and partly because getting a battery and recovery disks for it is proving to be such a royal pain to do. \nThe detector breaks and you feel slightly better about running XP on a machine with only 128M of memory. \n> WAIT \nTime passes. You have 4.5 hours of battery time remaining. \n> WAIT \nTime passes. You have 7 hours of battery life remaining. \n> WAIT \nYour P1000 switches off - possibly because the battery life has never worked properly with a dud battery or possibly because you used it as a hammer. \nIt's pitch dark, and you can't see a thing. \n> WAIT \nIt's pitch dark, and you can't see a thing. You hear sounds outside the door. \n> BANG ON DOOR \nThe sounds outside the door get much louder, as if someone were hitting it with a large axe. \n> WAIT \nThe door is open, there is a fireman here. \n> QUIT \n\"That was a lucky call,\" the fireman says to me as I exit through the wreckage of the door. Ordinarily we don't respond to sensor faults, but the monitoring company said that they'd had someone tampering with your company's config this morning so they wanted to be on the safe side. \n\"And I'm so pleased they did!\" I say. \n\"Yeah, apparently the person who did the tampering did reset the service-mode switch, which trips an alarm after 4 hours.\" \n\"The service-mode switch you say?\" I ask. \"And how does one reset that then - not that I'd ever need to use it to isolate a room which I would subsequently lock my assistant into.\" \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"Nothing, thanks again, and if you'll just excuse me I have to go and see my assistant...\" \n>F.E.A.R MODE ON!< \n"}

The casual observer might immediately think vandalism, however, I see a pattern to the damage.\" \n\"Which is Sherlock?\" Watson asks. \n\"You will note the contents of my desktop have landed on the floor prior the contents of yours, evidenced by the number of items of yours laying on top of mine.\" \n\"Yes, yes, now you mention it, I do,\" my assistant responds. \n\"And note also that a path appears to be cleared between the two desks subsequent to the damage which in turn suggests that the culprit started at my desk, went to yours, then returned to mine - which goes to prove my longstanding truth that a criminal will always return to the scene of the crime.\" \n\"Ah, isn't that supposed to be much LATER?\" \n\"Could be later, could be sooner - who can tell the mind of a disorganised criminal? And look, over here on my display, an unsent email message of some sort, the text of which would appear to be in some code...\" \n\"Yes, I see - but what does the code say?\" \n\"It's a mystery to me, but could be something simple like a random substitution cipher - note how there are word boundaries and differently sized words - In fact it could be a simple key registration shift cipher.\" \n\"A key register shift cipher?\" \n\"Yes, where the letter Q is replaced by W, W is replaced by E, E by R and so on, wrapping around at the end of the keypad. You will recall my case of the dancing men?\" \n\"Ah yes, where we encountered strange drawings of figures which was in fact a simple semaphore based code?\" \n\"No, I mean the time we encountered those men Morris dancing.\" \n\"What's the mystery in that?\" \n\"Why they'd do it, how they keep their disgusting pastime secret from their friends, why it's not illegal, er, etc.\" \n\"No, I don't recall that, but what has it to do with our current case?\" my assistant asks. \n\"Nothing, I just like recalling my triumphs from time to time - like the mystery of the Rubenesque maiden.\" \n\"The time you couldn't figure out how the large barmaid from the plough ended up in your bed?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"After a night of heavy drinking with some vendors at the pub?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Some mysteries are just unexplainable,\" my assistant responds - and do my delicate senses detect a hint of sarcasm?? \n\"However, back to the case in hand. First, eliminate suspects - where were you last night?\" \n\"At a vendor bash with you?\" my assistant answers. \n\"Indeed you were, and I can corroborate that myself - for part of the night at least. And what time did you leave?\" \n\"About 10 - and you were leaving shortly thereafter to get to the station well before the last tube ran in case you mislaid your tube pass again.\" \n\"Indeed I was - which leaves only one possible culprit!\" I cry. \n\"Who?\" \n\"Martians!\" \n\"Martians?!\" \n\"Yes, living for years below the surface of the planet to avoid detection they have finally broken cover to come here and steal our advanced technology.\" \n\"Ridiculous!\" \n\"Not so! As I have often said, when you eliminate all possible solutions what remains - however improbable - must be the solution!\" \n\"If Martians had the technology to get here surely they'd have more advanced technology than us earthlings - who can't even land on the moon?\" \n\"You're suggesting we haven't reached the moon?\" \n\"If we HAVE reached the moon, why don't we ever see pictures of the lunar rover from telescopes?\" \n\"Simple! They parked it on the Dark Side of the moon so as not to attract undue attention from the wrong people. Dodgy neighborhoods and all that.\" \n\"I think it's all a little far fetched Holmes,\" my assistant says dubiously. \"And there simply must be a more reasonable explanation that doesn't involve extra terrestrials, which we could uncover with a bit more legwork.\" \n\"And that explanation is?\" \n\"I'm not sure, but I'm positive we could find something which would shed a littl...But wait! I think I've uncovered a clue!!!\" \n\"What?\" \n\"In the bin, four empty cans of Tennants Extra!!!\" \n\"TRAMPJUICE!\" I cry. \"So you're suggesting tramps broke into our offices to steal our advanced technology?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"They broke in to use our bin?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"So they broke in for no reason at all? I suppose it's plausible...\" \n\"How about something a little more plausible?\" my assistant suggests. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"The culprit was attending a vendor drinking session and left without the accompaniment a barmaid. Feeling lowly he stopped in at a friendly off license for a couple of cans of cheap booze to take the edge off the tube ride home. Realising he left his tube pass in his office, the culprit returned to search the office for it, making a mess in the process. Ring any bells?\" \n\"What, you're suggesting I did this?\" \n\"Of course. You do it every six months or so Holmes.\" \n\"Really.\" \n\"Yes, and remember, you always have vague memories of being in a large waiting room filled with computer equipment?\" \n\"Oh yes, it's all becoming clear to me now!\" I sigh. \"But how do you explained the coded message.\" \n\"I checked the keyboard registration thingy,\" the PFY replies. \"It's you trying to tell me you'll probably be in late.\" \n\"Ah!\" \n\"Case closed?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes, I think you're right - although I wouldn't open your top drawer if I were you?\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"I seem to recall using the bathroom.

It's a bit of a read, if I say so myself!\" \nWhich is what worries me... \n\"You don't mind if I take myself off somewhere quiet to run over a couple of chapters?\" \n\"And I could look at a couple too so we can get back to you quicker,\" the PFY offers. \n\"I...I don't see why not - you've nothing important on?\" \n\"Nah, a database recovery, some system tuning and a couple of helpdesk calls - nothing that can't wait...\" \n\"Excellent.\" \n...Later at the pub... \n\"Listen to this,\" the PFY says, moving his pint aside and pointing to a chunk of text \"...'and it turned out that the engineer had installed the 380-B1 backplane instead of the 380-B2, which took us almost two days to discover because although the 380-B1 was an eight bit bus it had a parity complement option, which the engineer hadn't noticed'.\" \n\"Riveting stuff,\" I concur. \"But I think I can top that with three pages of a stack dump that once came off a console printer - which he proceeds to diagnose instruction by instruction...\" \n...Later that same day... \n\"So what did you think?\" the head asks excitedly as he catches us trying to sneak back into the office to get our coats and leave... \n\"Well, overall...\" the PFY starts. \n\"..it's a page turner,\" I say. \n\"Yes, you can't wait to see how it ends,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Anything I should change?\" \n\"Well, maybe go a little lighter on the technical detail and a bit more into funny anecdotes?\" I suggest. \n\"Oh you mean like the system 380 backplane mixup?\" he chuckles. \n\"Not exactly. I think you should be aiming more at funny-ha-ha then funny-I-want-to-kill-myself.\" \n\"What are you saying?\" \n\"That the mainstream buyers would probably like to hear more about you pushing a pie into Bill Gate's face,\" I say. \n\"Or the time you got rat-arsed at a trade show, hijacked a segway and drove it into a swimming pool,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Or when you gave Richard Stallman a free beer...\" \n\"But I've never done those things?!\" \n\"It's an IT autobiography - you're expected to lie about things,\" I say. \"You know, how you discovered the 'byte' while you were working with some Christmas tree lights one day or how you had a vision for the internet which you accidentally disclosed over drinks at a University pub one day.\" \n\"Yeah,\" the PFY adds. \"And when you write about yourself you have to imply that the so-called technologists were really as thick as a VAX architecture guide and how YOU played THE pivotal role in guiding them to their discovery.\" \n\"But people know who discovered things!\" \n\"They THINK they do - but once you release your book 'HOW JOBS, GATES, WOZ and ELLISON SCREWED MY KIDS OUT OF THEIR INHERITANCE' people will start wondering...\" \n\"I haven't got any kids!\" \n\"Of course you don't,\" I say. \"Because you didn't have enough royalties from your stolen intellectual property to pay for their lifesaving operations!\" \n\"Put that in the book!\" the PFY advises \"...then steal some photos of kids off MySpace - ones with a cute dog in the picture work best - and age the image up a bit with Photoshop.\" \n\"So you're suggesting I lie?\" \n\"A)It's computing, and B) It's an autobiography,\" the PFY says. \"People know they're going to be lied to.\" \n\"And you think it'll sell?\" \n\"Better than you'd think,\" the PFY predicts. \"But publish a couple of chapters on the web first to get a bit of interest going...\" \n... \nThree days later the amount of paper on the head's desk has grown astronomically - and that's just the lawsuits!

I'm surprised you're looking at getting one though as there's no fancy bells as whistles.\" \n\"Oh it's not for me!\" The Boss gasps, digging out yet another brochure from his briefcase. \"Heavens no! Anyway, what do you think of this?\" \n\"Hmmmm, a 64 seat 56k Modem pool - how... er.. last century,\" The PFY says. \n\"Last century?! But it's got data compression!\" The Boss adds defensively. \n\"So do most of my smutty pictures,\" The PFY says, without missing a beat. \"But surely we should be living in the Now?\" \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"Meaning we'd expect our people to be using ADSL or broadband of some sort, not dialup.\" \n\"And isn't 64 seats a little bit overkill don't you think?\" I add. \"I mean we'd be lucky to get ten people using the existing pool.\" \n\"Yes, but if we implement the new work-from-home scheme those numbers would rise,\" The Boss burbles with a measure of triumph. \n\"Work from home?\" \n\"Yes. The company's been considering it for a while now and the Head of IT's asked me to implement it.\" \n\"Really, why?\" \n\"It seems that a lot of current research suggests that companies like ours can actually achieve performance gains and associated savings by allowing staff to work from home one or two days a week.\" \n\"But surely that research could be reinterpreted to mean that companies like ours have a high proportion of staff who just arse around at work?\" I ask. \n\"I don't think so. The numbers are very positive - In fact in some cases productivity was seen to double!\" \n\"Twice nothing is still nothing,\" The PFY adds sagely. \n\"HEY!\" I cry, having a brainstorm. What about if we implemented a work from work scheme?” \n\"What do you mean by 'twice nothing'?\" the Boss asks, ignoring me. \n\"He means that some of our staff don't do anything anyway - but to look on the bright side at least with the work-from-home scheme they wouldn't take up office space.\" \n\"And that's the main point,\" The Boss says. \"We're paying very high rentals for our office space, power, cleaning, etc, and if we got staff to work from home for a day a week and implemented a deskless office we'd be cable to consolidate the office space and relinquish an entire floor\" \n\"Deskless office?\" the PFY says \n\"Ah” I respond before the Boss can get involved “An office where noone has a specific desk and people use available space combined with mobile & follow-me phone technology. It's very huggy feely with everyone being friends and sharing resources\" \n\"So it'll never work,\" the PFY says. \n\"Not a chance.\" \n\"But it makes perfect financial sense,\" the Boss Heimi Hendersons. \n\"Suit yourself,\" I say. \n\"So you're not actually averse to the ideal of trialling a work-from-home?\" \n\"On the contrary. I think it's a fantastic idea,\" I say. \n\"Really?\" the Boss chirps, happy that he's not going to have to defend the idea to anyone. \n\"Sure! I mean if we get some of the deadwood working from home there's the distinct possibility their wives will catch them browsing porn for half the day and they'll get the kicking they so richly deserve!!!\" \n“And everyone wins!” The PFY says. \n\"I doubt that people waste that much of the day,\" The Boss says. \n\"I think you'd be surprised. Some of our staff spend about three hours a day posting to a Hi-Tech audio blogsite.\" \n\"There's nothing dodgy about that!\" The Boss gasps. \n\"It could be argued that there is when you spend about several hours every working day commenting on Class A & B amplifier design theory!\" The PFY says. \n\"But that's just a hobby, not pornography!\" \n\"Using that reasoning, if I called pornography a hobby could I spend three hours a day on it?\" The PFY asks. \n\"Of course not!\" \n\"Ah well, never mind. But back to the issue at hand. The company wants this to save money on rent, yes?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And they have no problem spending stacks of cash on the deskless office idea, laptops, mobile phone calling and ADSL subscriptions?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Which would still work out at less than they're spending on rent?\" \n\"Considerably less.\" \n\"And it's better than just firing people?\" \n\"We can't do that and you know it. The unions would be all over us.\" \n\"What about - and this is just off the top of my head - forming an offshoot company and giving everyone the option of 'transferring' to the new 'work-from-home' company which will lease out one of the floors we vacate.\" \n\"The deadwood would be in there like a rat up a drainpipe,\" The PFY adds. \n\"Then, in three months time say, just send the company bankrupt - or alternatively just let our beancounters run it into the ground...\" \n\"And as a result...we've saved rent and...reduced our non-performing workforce?\" The Boss asks. \"Hmm. How many people do you think we'll be able to get to go?\" \n\"I'm guessing most of the Beancounters, all of PR and Marketing, about half of the PAs and some business analysts. Maybe 50.\" \n\"So we're talking 50 laptops,\" The Boss mumbles wandering off quickly to get the order in. \n\"Fifty?\" The PFY says dubiously. \n\"Not a chance, so many middle and upper middle managers will apply that the idea'll be canned quicker than you can say constructive dismissal. Sure, we'll end up with a stockpile of brand new laptops which we will be unable to return because they'll be...shop-soiled...\" \n\"I swear it shall be done!\" The PFY chirps. \n\"Which just leaves...\" \n\"Listing them on eBay with a ridiculously low reserve,\" The PFY adds, grabbing the brochure the Boss left behind. \"I'll get right onto it!\" \n\"Right then, if anyone wants me I'll be... \" \n\"Working from home?\" \n\"Exactly!\" I say, leaving for the pub. \n"}

It was my old work one which the company sold me.\" \n\"But you've only worked here a couple of months...\" \n\"My old company.\" \n\"So you want me to look at a machine that's not work related, not for a worker, and didn't even originate here?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Sure bring it in - I'm sure we can do something with it,\" the PFY says. \"And your toaster - is that working good too?\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"We may as well fix that at the same time!\" \n\"No, it's fine,\" the Boss says, missing the sarcasm. \"But I will bring the laptop in - although it's not that portable.\" \n\"It's a laptop!\" \n\"Yes, but it's heavy.\" \n\"How heavy can a laptop be?\" \n. . . \nThe next day dawns and the boss drags the machine in. At first glance it looks like your normal ancient oversized laptop (thankfully not one of those awful luggables with a CRT inside) but a closer inspection reveals a machine made in a time when robustness and impressive weight meant something to a manufacturer. \n\"Honestly, this thing weighs about 35 pounds!” the PFY gasps, levering it up onto his desk. \" What's it made of, lead?! \n\"I... don't know\" the Boss says, still getting his breath back after the walk from the lift. \n\"Oooh, inbuilt power supply,\" I say, stroking the case lovingly. \"Always good for an extra pound or so - or ten as it's a transformer based one.\" \n\"You're joking,\" the PFY blurts, looking down the vent holes. \"Wow!\" \n\"Yeeees,\" I say, pushing the power button. \"Oooooh, A P2 with 2 memory banks containing... 64 Meg.\" \n\"A scorcher - oh, and is that the battery warning light?\" \n\"And after just 12 minutes - I bet it's lead acid\" . \n\"Or just lead,\" the PFY nods. \"What are you running 98?\" \n\"Windows XP,\" the Boss replies. \n\"Slower than a 5 day cricket test is it?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"You should go to Vista.\" \n\"So you like Vista?\" \n\"Not really, no. I run a Vista simulator.\" \n\"Virtual Server?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Nah, I just turned on all the flashy crap in XP, changed the background image, took some memory out of my box and clocked down the CPU. Then broke Media player. Works like a charm.\" \n\"So you don't like it?\" \n\"No. But it has does have one advantage.\" \n\"What's that?\" \n\"It causes a clean reinstall of XP which is generally good from a defrag point of view.\" \n\"So you're not really suggesting I install Vista?\" \n\"No. Even if you could you shouldn't - not with this baby\/\" \n\"So I should keep XP?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Downgrade to 2000?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Windows 98?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"95?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"What am I supposed to do with it then?\" \n\"Take my advice,\" the PFY says. “Nail a couple of planks to either side and use it as a bedside table. \n\"But... I thought you could do something with it.\" \n\"Yeah - the bedside table idea!\" \n\"But it's a perfectly good laptop.\" \n\"No, it's a craptop - there's a subtle difference.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"About 30 pounds.\" \n\"But it's perfectly good.\" \n\"Okay, tell you what. Pop it on the front seat of your car, wind the window down and take a walk around the block. I'll bet you 50 quid it's still there when you get back!\" \n\"50 quid?\" he echoes. \n\"50 Quid!\" the PFY responds, taking the aforementioned sum out of his wallet and handing it to me. \n. . . Two hours later . . . \n\"It was still there wasn't it?\" the PFY says, reaching for his cash. \n\"Yes,\" the Boss sighs. \"But my car stereo and internal door handles weren't. The stereo's useless to anyone as it's coded to the door key - and who the hell needs door handles?\" \n\"It's a strange world,\" the PFY agrees as the Boss exits Mission Control shaking his head. \n\"So this is worthless then?\" I say, tossing the Boss's car stereo into the bin. \"But why did you want the door handles?\" \n\"Just for the chuckle when he gets home.\" \n\"I... Oh! ...So that's why you wanted the fuse for the electric windows.\" \n\"Electric Windows Vista - just like the real thing!\" the PFY smirks, chucking the handles after the stereo. \n"}

It's such a beginner's mistake!\" I comment, shaking my head sadly. \n\"Going on a junket at a vendor's expense is a mistake?\" the PFY asks, surprised. \n\"In some cases, yes. Rule one of going on a Vendor Bender is always play on your home ground so you know how to get home - or at least where home is. At the VERY least you should be in a place where you can ask a local where your hotel is. Rule two, three and four are Never, EVER go to Amsterdam with a Vendor! \" \n\"I don't see how it would...\" \n\"Ok, so you're out with vendors.

So you're at a curry house - what will you need?\" \n\"Kingfishers!\" \n\"More drinks, right. And somewhere along the way, you're going to pay up and go back to your hotel.

Three days later when your money runs out you'll leave the coffee shop and lie to the person at the airport about the family emergency that caused you to miss your flight and you'll get to Heathrow.\" \n\"With no money.\" \n\"Indeed. And you'll bludge a phone to call to the Mrs to pick you up and on the way home she'll ask how it went, you'll make up some pathetically unbelievable story because you can't remember, which will inevitably lead to...\" \n\"A fight!\" \nYes, and she'll make up some equally unbelievable story about hearing some funny engine noise and pull over. You'll get out to check the engine and she'll drive off, leaving you on the M25 with tons of time to make up your mind about where you're going to walk to - work or home. \n\"And work is nearer, and everyone there doesn't hate you at the moment for whatever it was you did in Amsterdam that you felt it necessary to lie about,\" the PFY finishes. \n\"Correct.\" \n\"And you can tell all this from his appearance Holmes?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Nah, he rang in to say he'd be late and it all came out.

I too went on an overseas junket which turned to custard, if I'm not mixing my desserts.\" \n\"You?\" \n\"Yes, a Berlin 'Wall shout'.

Bom-Bommmmm,\" I respond. \n\"And you're not worried?\" \n\"Nah, like I said it'll take years for them to figure out how our systems work.\" \n\"So...what do we do?\" yet another voice asks. \n\"Well...\" \n\"What?!\" someone demands. \n\"Job security by job obscurity is the key. Burn all documentation so no one can figure out what you do. Fabricate and post-date memos from HR guaranteeing you 52 week severance payouts as amendments to your employment contracts - keeping a copy for yourself obviously - then get a friendly HR person to sign them and insert them into your file.\" \n\"What, they'll just do that for us?\" \n\"I suspect they inserted 104 week amendments as soon as they heard of a 'merger'.\" \n\"And that will save our jobs?\" \n\"No, but the thought of large severance packages and huge integration hurdles will give them a few moments of pause...\" \n\"And then?\" \n\" By then my assistant and I will have worked our magic.\" \n\"?\" \n\"We get some acquaintances in the City to circulate rumours that the company's taking us over just to get out of their asbestos riddled building before the class-action lawsuit is filed.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Who cares?

Being the professional that he is, he investigates the error and finds that the affected file is a video and that the cheap playback system installed on the machine - presumably because it's one of the few that doesn't report back what you're looking at - has locked the file for read. Say this professional, having not seen the video hotchickbj.mpg PRESUMES that it's a workplace safety video for instance and remotely forces the application to close so that he can get the backup system to open the file before it's viewed again. Say all that happens, and this zealous operational type realises that and offsite backup of this user's data would be a good option and sends the DVD backup to the person's home address. And maybe his wife chucks it in the DVD player thinking it's a movie and the only thing renderable on their DVD player is the safety video. And she decided to confront you at work and look at your laptop.\" \n\"Fair enough,\" the Boss says, realising he's both cornered and busted. \"In THAT situation, MAYBE I would want to test my laptop for it's ability to fall from the roof of a building, but that's hardly li..\" \n\"Oooh look, it's your Mrs!\" I say, pointing behind the Boss. \"...Made you look.\" \n\"Did you send a DVD to my home.\" \n\"Of course I did, I was ensuring data safety. What time does the post come round your way?\" \n>SLAM!< \n...two hours later... \n\"You're for it now!\" the Boss wheezes, all pretence gone after his cross town dash. \"Why the hell would you want to take a copy of my porn - it's not data of value to the company?\" \n\"It is if they want to fire you,\" the PFY says. \n\"Not when I do THIS,\" he says, snapping a DVD sized envelope in half. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because now there's no evidence - no laptop, no backup.\" \n\"What about the onsite backup?\" the PFY asks. \n\"What onsite backup?\" \n\"Well there's two really - the one we keep in the tape safe and the one that I must have accidentally put in the Head of IT's DVD drive...\" \n>SLAM!< \n\"...or was it the AV system in the boardroom - I can't remember exactly.\" \n\"Never mind about that now,\" I say. \"I need your help testing the duplexing Multifunction printer with the additional stapling and perfect binding unit.\" \n\"Is that a computer?\" \n\"It has a hard drive...\" \n\"Oh yeah...\" \n\"And get a jiggle on, the Boss is in the 30 minute parking zone.\" \n"}

I'm also saying we shouldn't be promoting a forum for them not to say it in.\" \n\"I...\" the Boss pauses, working out the double triple negative. \n\"LOOK,\" I say trying to demystify the PFY's words. \"Your average beancounter for instance, what's he going to say to the masses?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"He's going to say that thanks to his ingenious plan of importing pens directly from a former Russian state he's saved the company a couple of thousand pounds a year.\" \n\"It doesn't sound all that ingenious,\" the Boss murmurs. \n\"No, the ingenious part will be the bit he doesn't say - that he bought the pens knowing that most of them will fail and people will start bringing their own pens in and the company won't have to buy pens any more.\" \n\"I guess that's sort of ingenious.\" \n\"No it's not, because we paid for the dud pens in the first place! Ingenious would be to have a competition to see how many free pens staff can obtain from vendors clients and suppliers, with a 10 quid movie voucher as a prize!\" \n\"I...\" \n\"And even that is boring.\" \n\"I don't get your point...\" \n\"My point is that what people think is interesting really isn't.

No, no, that's right, you were telling one of your train stories again - I can tell the difference now because aliens only steal nine MINUTES, not NINE HOURS!\" \n\"So the train thing was a demonstration of something you find uninteresting?\" the Boss says drily. \n\"Its something everyone finds uninteresting. So if you're going to podcast something we should find something that people WANT to watch and make some of that.\" \n\"Porn,\" the PFY blurts. \"Everyone likes porn!\" \n\"You'll have to forgive my assistant,\" I counter. \"He dropped a bottle of isopropyl this morning and stayed to clean it up.\" \n\"So what would people find interesting?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Porn!\" the PFY repeats. \n\"I don't know,\" I say, ignoring the PFY. \"But that IS the point - the real work is in finding out what people want to see...\" \n\"PORN!\" \n\"...then once you've found it, make some of it - or hire someone to make some of it.\" \n\"Isn't it a little... twofaced... to get someone in to make videos which are supposed to be made by us?\" \n\"You'll never regret using a professional.\" \n\"Are we still talking about Porn?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Regardless,\" the Boss says, following my example and ignoring the PFY. \"I'd like to set up a server so that anyone in the company can publish stuff.\" \n\"P...\" the PFY starts. \n\"EXCEPT for him!\" the Boss interrupts. \nI quickly realise that the Boss is going to want this to happen and that any advice to the contrary is going to be ignored... \n\"I guess we could use one of our recently decommissioned servers - till things pick up - that way we'd probably have everything up and running in a couple of days,\" I suggest. \n\"Excellent.\" \n...three days later.. \n\"How many podcasts have we got?\" the Boss asks anxiously. \n\"Hang on, I'll just count... ...uh ...and... ...None\" \n\"But someone must have something to put up.\" \n\"I could...\" the PFY starts. \n\"It's to be used for things pertaining to the company, its staff and business, and things of interest to them!\" the Boss snaps. \"Nothing else.

Any viewers?\" \n\"Stacks.\" \n\"What's been put up?\" the PFY and the Boss ask simultaneously. \n\"One of the beancounters has an interesting video on recycling paperclips and staples.\" \n\"...\" \n\"And the mail room has one about how to fill out shipping labels - although my personal favourite is the security fire drill procedure...\" \n\"I thought you said there were stacks of viewers!?\" the PFY says. \n\"Yes, but not for them.\" \n\"What are they watching?\" \n\"An instructional piece contributed anonymously entitled how to get a shag at the office Christmas party.\" \n\"Porn?\" the PFY asks hesitantly. \n\"No, more a morale and recruiting piece aimed at people who might otherwise not get a shag in the normal course of events. It meets all the prerequisite criteria by being of interest to the company and featuring footage of actual company Christmas parties... >DASH!< >SLAM!< ...Featuring actual staff. And, in a couple of cases some clients.\" \n\"PORN!\" the PFY sighs happily, sitting himself down. \nSo the Boss was right - it was good for morale. \n"}

So, what's up now?\" \n\"Well, I thought I'd spend the rest of the afternoon playing Stalker , get 10 pints in at the pub, a quick curry chaser, then fall asleep in the tube and wake up in Snaresbrook five minutes after the last train.\" \n\"Now THAT's a hobby!\" the PFY says. \n"}

As space is a little limited we thought we'd install the unit in an alcove on the floor above and duct chilled air down into the room.\" \n\"What about UPS power?\" the PFY chimes in. \n\"Can't we just leave the UPS here and run power down from it?\" the Boss says. \n\"I doubt the people using the 'prime office space' will consider a 120KVA UPS with noisy inverters to be a desirable roommate.\" \n\"Point taken. I suppose we could move it to the sub basement and just get a smaller unit for the critical users left up here.\" \n\"Sorry, are you proposing we move as well?\" I ask. \n\"Well yes - you'd need to be close to your machines wouldn't you?\" \n\"THE SUB BASEMENT!\" the PFY cries, having lost his love of dark, enclosed spaces during one of those weekend-in-a-lift practical joke sessions we enjoy so much. \n\"It makes perfect sense!\" the Boss replies \"A computer room has very few visitors - it doesn't need a second floor office space - and you don't even like visitors.\" \n\"We'd need fire suppression,\" I add. \n\"Not a worry, we can install that in the basement along with the air-conditioning. I've been promised three car park spaces in the basement to house air-conditioning and other services.\" \n\"Emergency lighting?\" \n\"One at each end of the space.\" \n\"Offices?\" I ask. \"Assuming of course that you weren't proposing we work in the computer room itself.\" \n\"I... not a problem, we'll have an office built.\" \n\"Cabling?\" \n\"What cabling?\" \n\"The fibre and copper network cabling, the patch frames, the rack cabling.\" \n\"Oh... Do we really need them?\" \n\"You mean could we fit wireless lan cards to every server and cover a wall with Wireless Access points?\" \n\"I... yes.\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Oh. So how long would it take to get the network installed?\" \n\"You mean repatch the fibre and copper distribution components down there, put in PBE frames, fibre termination points, racks and rack cabling? A couple of months.\" \n\"I... guess that would be ok. It affects the time frame a little but it shouldn't be too bad - should we go and look at the room just in case we see anything else we might want to consider?\" \n. . . Five minutes and several unhappy gestures from the PFY later. . . \n\"So this is the room,\" the Boss says, showing us into a large clinically clean concrete room. \n\"It's big,\" I say. \n\"What's that smell?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Oh that, that's just a... two pot leak-sealing compound the contractors used to make the place completely watertight - because I knew you'd be concerned about leaks and flooding in a sub basement area,\" the Boss says smugly. \n\"So you've started work on this already without discussing it with us?\" \n\"I... well yes, we're under a bit of pressure for the space so I thought I'd get a headstart by organising some of the work that I knew would be needed - like the leak sealing and the access for the air-conditioning - see up there?\" \n\"Where?\" the PFY asks, gazing into the roof space blankly. \n\"There, to the right. That hole corresponds with the alcove at the back of the car park where the bin normally sits. The bin will be moved outside and the air-conditioning and fire gear can be ducted through that hole into the room.\" \n\"Sorry, to go back to a previous point - you said something about pressure for space?\" \n\"Uh... yes. Yes we need the space on the second floor - as soon as possible.\" \n\"For...\" \n\"For a... uhhhm... video conferencing, multimedia and fishbowling centre,\" the Boss blurts. \n\"A multimedia centre!\" the PFY cries. \"You're planning on moving us so you can chat to mates and watch movies! Whose bright idea was that?\" \n\"I... Well it's not like you interact with people anyway,\" the Boss says defensively. \n\"And let's face it,\" I add. \"This is a greenfields computer suite - we could build the perfect computer room here.\" \n\"What?\" the PFY gasps. \n\"It's perfect - below ground so not subject to wild variations in temperature, watertight so not prone to flooding, overhead services so we don't need to sacrifice valuable computer room space for non-computing use, isolated and secure - it's perfect!\" \n\"PERFECT!?!?!\" \n\"Sure - well, almost perfect. I think the aircon ducting run might be a little long from ceiling to underfloor though - a little lossy,\" I say, pulling a seemingly valid criticism out of my nether regions. \n\"It should be ok,\" the Boss says, not wanting to ask what the hell 'lossy' means. \n\"Are you sure - it's a little long. Have you got a measuring tape?\" \n\"Sure,\" the Boss says, handing one over. \n\"Okay, I'll feed the tape down and can you just hold it about 200mm from the floor - where the subfloor would start.\" \n\"Okay then,\" the Boss says as the PFY and I exit. \n. . . two minutes later . . . \n\"How's that?\" the Boss asks from below us. \n\"Fantastic,\" I say. \"11 feet three inches. And what's the size of the room again?\" \n\"Thirty feet by twenty feet, why?\" \n\"And what rate does water come out of one of these babies?\" I say dropping the fire hose into the hole a little while the PFY turns the handle. \n>GUSH!!!< \n>rattle< >rattle< >RATTLE!!!< \n\"The door's stuck!!!\" the Boss cries as the PFY pushes the bin back over the hole \n>indistinct rattle< \n\"Completely watertight you say? So I guess he'll get to try that fishbowling going WAY ahead of schedule...\" the PFY sighs. \n. . . \n"}

Who was it?\" \n\"Bloke from accounts payable. Henderson.\" \n\"And you thought of them why?\" the head of IT asks. \n\"We thought he'd died from natural causes,\" security says, nodding at the PFY. \n\"Natural causes?\" \n\"Yeah, electrocution, drowning, poisoning...\" \n\"They're not natural causes!\" the head gasps. \n\"They are if you call me at 4am whining about the quality of toner,\" I snap. \"Not that this bloke...uhm...\" \n\"Henderson,\" security supplies helpfully. \n\"...did that.\" \n\"So you thought of them because?\" \n\"Because he was a beancounter and because he had one of these in his hand,\" security says, holding up a USB key. \n\"A USB key,\" the PFY says. \"What's on it?\" \n\"I was hoping you'd be able to tell me that – it's encrypted.\" \n\"Ah...shouldn't the Police be doing that?\" the PFY says, choosing the cautious route. \n\"They should be, but I've been asked to take a look at it because Henderson was being monitored internally. It seems he was a little enthusiastic in processing the payments he's been authorising the last few months. Paying them two or three times in some cases...\" \n\"And THAT'S why you thought of us – you thought he'd been overpaying us?\" \n\"No, the payments were all to an auditing company for 'consultancy' fees,\" the head of IT says, getting in on the act. \"But our company doesn't want its name in the E-Crime reports since the CEO's a charter member of the E-Crime Awareness Committee, and it might look bad...\" \n\"So let's get this straight – your sole reason for suspecting that we had something to do with it was because the guy was carrying a USB key?\" \n\"He was naked,\" security adds. \n\"Oh please tell me he was 'carrying it' in his hand!\" the PFY says, dropping it on his desk while suppressing a gag reflex. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Oh, right then >PLUG!<\" the PFY sighs. \"Okay, >clickety< so it's a USB Key-based encryption system with... >tap< >tap< hundreds of trillions of possible keys and >clickety< would most likely take several weeks of computing time to crack.\" \n\"Really?\" the head of IT gasps. \n\"Nah, it's a raw image of an encrypted ZIP file – >tap< >tap< and an very early version of ZIP at that.\" \n\"So when will you have it cracked?\" security asks. \n\"Now,\" the PFY says, opening a spreadsheet onto the window. \">clickety< Hm... >tapity-click< It's just a spreadsheet of payments – hardly worth putting into a zip file at all – certainly not worth encrypting >tappity<\" \n\"Nothing else hidden on the device?!?\" \n\">clickety< Nnnnooo, doesn't look like it. >tappity< By the look of it the key was brand new – or newly low-level erased and the Zip file raw copied over it – the rest is blank. So it looks like you're back to square one – perhaps someone at the audit company thought he knew too much?\" \n\"Yes, it's possible – but at least we know we're not going to be handing over any data which might embarrass the CEO,\" security says. \"We can hand this over to the Police safe in the knowledge that no further invoices will be triple paid. And now that that's cleared up.. >RING< Hello... Yes... Yes... really? Okay, yes... good, goodbye then.\" \n\"What is it?\" the head asks expectantly. \n\"A friend of mine keeping me posted about the coroner's report – it was natural causes.\" \n\"You mean electric...\" \n\"No stroke. The coroner reckons he probably dropped the key, bent over to pick it up and BAM, lights out matron!\" \n\"So it wasn't them?\" the head asks dubiously looking at the PFY and myself. \n\"Nope, just a random event – could have happened to anyone,\" security says, grabbing the USB key and wandering off sheepishly with the head of IT in tow. \n... \n\"So you opened your own auditing office,\" I say to the PFY once they're gone. \"Ballsy! But the stroke thing – a piece of luck or overdose of blood thinners in the water fountain?\" \n\"ME?!\" \" the PFY gasps. \" I thought it was you? \n\"Hell no. But the double payment stuff sounds good!\" \n\"Yeah, all the rage in Iraq. Apparently Henderson was paying the same bill on successive months by appending a suffix to the invoice number. On the third month he'd divert suspicion simply by paying the bill plus the overdue penalty so the numbers didn't recur. And the best part was he had a set of SQL statements which he'd trigger from his desktop to do it without leaving an audit trail in the finance package.\" \n\"That's pretty bloody clever...But how do you know all this?\" \n\"It was all in that ZIP file on the USB key.\" \n\"But that was only a spreadsheet!\" \n\"No, that was off the Beancounter's fileshare. The real ZIP file was much more interesting – he's kept notes and everything!\" \n\"So...\" \n\"I think it's time we got our names on the employee list at that auditing place...\" the PFY says, picking up the phone and bashing in a number... \n"}

What about our old one?\" \n\"I was under the impression we didn't have an old one.\" \n\"That's right,\" the PFY says defensively. \"Because we didn't need one.\" \n\"It seems you do. I was looking through the write off statistics and it seems that our equipment has some of the worst expected lifetimes around. In some cases we write off equipment that's almost new.\" \n\"Plasma screens have only recently settled down stability wise,\" the PFY counters. \"And the larger sized ones had the worst failure rate.\" \n\"Still, probably worth a warranty claim though,\" David chips in. \n\"Too late, it was disposed of,\" the PFY says before someone starts thinking about looking for it. At his place...connected to his DVD player... \n...Five minutes later... \n\"I don't like it,\" the PFY says. \"He's going to be a problem.\" \n\"Nah, he'll be fine,\" I say. \"The boredom will get to him.\" \n...The next day... \n\"Have you guys got an oscilloscope?\" Dave asks, with the Boss closely in tow. \n\"What for?\" \n\"Need to check the data lines of the IDE interface on that machine you're going to toast. We may not need to chuck it out as it may just be a faulty cable,\" he says. \n...Two minutes later after Dave's departed with the scope... \n\"The bastard!\" the PFY fumes. \"It took ages to pull that connector to bits and break off some of the data pins. I was going to use that as a home cinema!\" \n\"Yeah, he's good.

So if that's all I'll let you guys get onto the data recovery.\" \n\"Thanks,\" I say, letting Dave out. \n...Three hours later... \n\"Sorry for getting you back in again Dave, but it looks like another drive's failed,\" the PFY says, pointing to the machine. \n...Ten minutes later... \n\"That's funny.\" \n\"What is?\" the PFY says. \n\"This drive looks exactly the same as one of the ones I replaced earlier.\" \n\"They all look the exactly the same don't they?\" the PFY says. \n\"No, see how this one has a gouge in the label just before the brand name - I think I did that when I pulled the old one out of the drive tray.\" \n\"You must have done it twice,\" the PFY proffers. \n\"I don't think so. Say, do you have the old drives, I'd like to take a look at them.\" \n\"Oh, sorry, I didn't realise you'd want them. I sent them off to a sustainable recycler,\" the PFY replies, with more than a little sarcasm in his voice. \n...Later that day... \n\"...and then Dave replaced the third drive and we >yawn< recovered the data,\" I say, recounting the whole thing to the boss. \n\"Did you keep that drive then?\" Dave asks. \"Didn't send it off for recycling in the middle of the night?\" \n\"No, we kept it in case you wanted to check it against the next faulty drive,\" the PFY snaps. \n\"Which will probably occur tonight,\" Dave chips. \"Once around 2am and another at around...5?\" \nHe IS good! \n\"No, I'm sure it'll be ok,\" the PFY says. \"Besides, I'm so tired I'm unlikely to hear the pager.\" \n\"Yes, David mentioned you might be a little tired so I've had security give him access through your office to the Computer room 24x7.\" \n\"The bastard,\" I murmur before the PFY can say anything. \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"Hmm?\" I respond. \n... \n\"So we need to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that nothing goes wrong tonight so as not to justify his access.\" \n\"Should I check all the machines and do a bit of preventative maintenance?\" \n\"I was thinking more along the lines of disabling the fault reporting system,\" I say... \n\"ONTO IT!\" the PFY snaps. \n... \nThe next day dawns without incident - which I confirm when I run into the PFY while waiting for the lift. \n\"Not a tinkle - the pager was silent all night,\" he affirms as we enter Mission Control. \"MY DESKTOP!\" he gasps, seeing his monitor sitting on his chair. \n\"What did y... *MY* Desktop!\" I cry. \"And my laptop!

Not even a phone. \n\"They're good,\" I say, as the PFY looks under the Boss' desk for any evidence. \n\"There's a note,\" the PFY says pointing behind the door. \n\"It's to us!\" I say slamming the door and ripping down the note, \"It says 'Thanks for the memories, the kit and the plasma screen - Dave and John.'\" \n\"Who's John - and what plasma screen?\" \n\"John is the Boss and the only plasma screen they knew about is the one you've got at - \" \n\"What?\" \n\"You don't still keep a spare house key in your desk drawer do you?\" \n\"Yes, but it's loc..

No, a proper content management system makes it next to impossible to extract your content in any automated manner so that you're forced to use their product and pay their licence fees no matter how crap it is.\" \n\"But you said this wasn't a proper system.\" \n\"No, we said that this was a budget system - so it's worse. In their wisdom the designers adopted a file system model and split the files into 128K chunks with a pointer to the first chunk and a linked list thereafter. Once you lose the first pointer, it's gone - unless of course you rebuild the database and the right pointer wins.\" \n\"So we should delete some documents from the system?\" \n\"In theory we should delete all the documents from the system to free up pointers then rebuild the indexes which should retrieve all the missing documents. But it'd take ages to do that...\" \n\"Not if we work together,\" the Head gasps. \"But - how do we get the existing documents back?\" \n\"When we've rebuilt the index we extract all the recovered data files. Then we just recover the content management system from backups and reinsert the documents into it, safely.\" \n\"Right,\" the Head says, dashing off to get deleting. \n\"So when do we tell him that there's no index rebuild function?\" the PFY asks. \n\"AFTER I ring that company that gives you £50 for dobbing in companies who pirate software...\" I reply, picking up the Yellow Pages. \n\"But that would be after I discover that the backup utility on the content management system has been silently failing for months...All of which would be a week or so before we tell him that the licences were only colour photocopies of the originals in the tape safes...\" \n\"It's a plan!\" the PFY chirps. \n"}

The Boss's daughter is a rising star in the... uh... entertainment... industry.\" \n\"Ok then, so how about shouting a couple of pints with your winnings?\" \n\"It was double or nothing - there weren't any winnings,\" the PFY says. \"But what the hey!\" \nTen minutes later in the pub. \n\"Cheers,\" the PFY says, raising a pint. \"Hey, isn't that Gary?\" \nI look to where the PFY's pointing, and sure enough Gary, a bastard acquaintance from the financial district, is having quiet pint in the corner. Responding to his wave, the PFY and I wander over and take a seat. \n\"A little out of your home region aren't you?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah, but I thought I'd pop over and introduce you to my new assistant,\" Gary says. \n\"Really, who's that then?\" I ask looking around. \n\"Me,\" the PFY says. \n\"You?\" I gasp, realising the orchestration was a little more detailed than I'd thought. \n\"Yep, Gary's offered me a better deal.\" \n\"More money?\" \nThe PFY rattles off a figure that the average Beancounter would be pleased to see as a departmental budget and I can't help but be a little upset. \n\"You earn more than that here!\" \n\"Yes but there's more opportunities at Gary's place.\" \n\"But surely you're better off here?\" I sniff. \n\"Nah.\" \n\"What about loyalty?\" \n\"Eh?\" \n\"But I set you up with your first girlfriend,\" I gasp. \"In fact, I also set you up with your latest girlfriend!\" \n\"Yeah, well, that's over as of last night,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"Really? What a shame, I quite liked her. You don't still have her number do you?\" \n\"You were saying something about loyalty?\" Gary asks. \n\"It doesn't matter,\" the PFY says. \"It was over.\" \n\"So you have got her number then?\" I ask with what I now realise was unnecessary enthusiasm. \n\"I'm leaving,\" the PFY says, with some finality. \n\"I see,\" I say, noticing the glee on Gary's face. \nAnd that's how it is with bastard rivalry - when you've run out of users to torture, you turn on your own... \n\"I have to say you're taking this well,\" Gary murmurs half an hour later as the PFY empties a few personals from his desk and tips the rest into the bin. \n\"Yeah, well, this day was bound to come - it's time for him to spread his wings and maybe do something important with his life,\" I admit. \n... \nWhat a load of crap! If Gary things I'm going to take this one bending over, he's got another thing coming. Several in fact. \n...Two days later at 7am... \n\"Hello,\" Gary snorts, picking up his cellphone on the third ring. \n\"Gary, Simon here, just thought I'd ring and see how the PFY's doing?\" \n\"Bloody fantastic,\" Gary gushes. \"No hard feelings about me stealing your guy?\" \n\"None at all - and I take it that you're ok with me stealing your UPS batteries?\" \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"Your UPS batteries. I happened to notice them just laying around doing nothing. In your computer room. Very early this morning.\" \n\"There would have been an alarm!\" \n\"There SHOULD have been an alarm, yes, but there wasn't - which reminds me - I think the piezo speaker in your UPS is damaged. Looks like someone hit it repeatedly with the edge of a full drive tray that someone removed out of one of your RAID sets last night. They might not even have put it back into the same slot.\" \n\"I'd have been paged!\" \n\"Oh yes, I think someone might also have opened the Telco pit outside your building, smashed the copper and fibreoptic cables repeatedly with an axe then filled the pit up with quick setting concrete.\" \n\"Is that all?\" Gary sighs. \n\"I hear there might be a power shutdown in your area and I do believe that the tank on your diesel generator may have sprung a leak...\" \n\"When?\" \n\"The power cut?\" \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"How long does it take you to get into work?\" \n\"35 minutes.\" \n\"Oh, that's a shame, I think the cut is 34 minutes away...\" \n>sigh< \"So I just send him back then?\" Gary asks. \n\"If you like. Though you should probably warn him that the market's pretty buoyant at the moment so I don't know that we'll be able to offer the same as he was getting...\" \n...and I can't help thinking as I ease open the door of Gary's main switchboad, that this rivalry business might be getting more than a little crazy.

My go-to guy, the PFY could be trusted to know what I was looking for almost before I did myself and have it ready and waiting when I got there. I could send him off on a task in the full knowledge that he'll see it through to completion with no hitches or questions. \nAnd so it was a bit of a wrench when PFY forsook the comfort of the home pitch to play for another team - made worse by the two-month reemployment stand-down period which the department apparently has on contractors for some reason. This all means that in the meantime I don't have the ability to delegate those run-of-the-mill everyday functions that plague the life of a systems professional - in turn meaning that I end up having to do them myself... \n... \n\"What's the spade for?\" the Boss asks wandering into Mission Control. \n\"I...uh...gardening,\" I reply, scanning the helldesk database for a recent complaint. \n\"And this...uh...sack of...whatisit, lime?\" \n\"Gardening again,\" I repeat. \"Great for...uh...composting.\" \n\"The roll of old carpet?\" \n\"Still gardening.\" \n\"What do you use carpet for?\" he asks dubiously. \n\"Flip it upside down and use it as weed matting,\" I say, having prepared for this question earlier. \n\"Ah right, of course. You know I used to be a keen gardener,\" the Boss burbles, setting himself up for one of those directionless monologues that seems to plague the social interaction of so many members of middle management. \"I used to have brassicas, and leeks.\" \n\"Speaking of which, I'm busting for one myself,\" I add, getting out of the room before I get a run down on the basics of fertiliser application in small gardens... \n... \nWhen I get back from the visiting the Gents the situation is even worse. The head of IT and the Boss are engaged in a conversation about the benefits of crop rotation to avoid systemic plant illnesses. \n\"Riveting as this is, I have work to do, what with my assistant being away and all,\" I say, pointing at the screen. \"So if you'd just move on I could get down to the problem at hand. >clickety< Ah, here we are...the complainant was...M Easton.\" \n\"We could lend you a hand to catch up on your work if you need,\" the Boss suggests, much to the Head's surprise. \"And we could chat about gardening at the same time.\" \n!!! \nI blame the PFY. Had he not left in the pursuit of career advancement none of this would have been happening - M Easton, whoever the hell he is, would be safely wrapped in carpet in the back of a van speeding towards a disused allotment in the middle of nowhere and I'd be deleting a complaint about the speed of our data recoveries from the helldesk system. \n>clickety< >DELETE!< \n\"I'm sure we could give you a hand,\" the Head agrees. \n\"Could you?\" I ask. \"I need a bit of help digging a hole.\" \n\"What sort of hole?\" \n\"I dunno, six feet by two feet by, uh.. six feet deep.\"  \"You mean like a grave?\" the boss asks, then pauses anxiously. \n\"Sort of - I'm using the deep-cache method of liming.\" \n\"Deep-cache? I don't think I've heard of that?\" \n\"It's a new-age Biodynamic thing,\" I say. \"Quite new but showing some good results.\" \n\"Oh yes,\" the Boss asks dubiously. \"How does it work?\" \n\"Well, you dig a large hole, line it with a large quantity of lime, then a layer of compostable matter, then lime. The groundwater will seep up through the cache and distribute lime through the upper water table of the land as the compostable material breaks down.\" \n\"And what compostable matter were you going to use?\" the Boss asks, interested now. \n\"Oh, just anything biodegradable I found laying around the office - foodscraps, newspaper...M Easton.\" \n\"You're not going to get US helping you with THAT,\" the Head of IT snaps. \n\"Yes well, an alternative I have been considering recently is a deeper hole with several layers of lime and compostable matter. Three maybe, depending.\" \n\"Depending?\" \n\"On how many old carpets we have in the basement and whether the van's being used tonight - you won't be missed will you?\" \n\"Look what's the real problem?\" the Head asks, attempting to defuse the situation. \n\"The real issue - this moment - is that I'm recovering some data for this M Easton character as fast as I can change tapes and he's complaining about how slack we are.\" \n\"So the real issue is the lack of an assistant.\" \n\"That's part of it, yes.\" \n\"So what if we agreed to waive the stand-down period in this case?\" \n\"That would certainly help yes.\" \n\"And you'll abandon this...uh...several layers...option.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And leave this M Easton person alone?\" \n\"Sure.\" \n\"No retaliation at all?\" \n\"None.\" \n\"Ok then,\" the Boss sighs, easing towards the door with the Head of IT. \"We'll get that sorted straight away.\" \n...three hours later... \n\"Ahhh,\" the PFY says, plopping down into his chair. \"Back in the saddle.\" \n\"Indeed.\" \n\"What's the spade, lime and carpet for?\" \n\"One of the users, M Easton, called you a tosser.\" \n\"Right. I'll book the van!\" \nSee, it's like magic having an assistant! \n"}

If I add any more circuits you'll probably trip the main breaker and bring down the computer room the next time a power supply blows.\" \n\"It's on a UPS!\" the Boss says drily. \n\"Yeah,\" our Sparky says, pointing out, in turn, the parts of the power circuit diagram. \"Power Supply to Generator\/Supply changeover switch >tap<, to UPS >tap<; to Switchboard >tap<; to Computer Room >tap< - with a couple of Isolating switches >tap< >tap< thrown in.\" \n\"Which means?\" \n\"The problem is after the UPS,\" the PFY says helpfully. \n\"Exactly,\" our Sparky adds. \"A 100 KVA UPS breakered with a 80KVA circuit breaker which feeds a board currently running at 76KVA.\" \n\"?\" \n\"It means you have to replace the switchboard circuit breaker,\" the PFY says helpfully. \n\"And busbars to be on the safe side,\" the Sparky adds. \n\"What would that cost?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Ffffffffffffff.... \" our Sparky sighs - in the way sparkies tend to do when they're trying to work out whether to go first or business class on their next holiday... \"I'd have to get some prices.\" \n\"Prices?\" \n\"Yeah, circuit breakers, new switchboard, busbars, cable - which is a nightmare now with the price of copper - and cutout switches.\" \n\"Ballpark figure?\" the Boss asks. \n\"You're not going to have much change out of eight grand,\" he says, opting for the first class seats to Switzerland. And the expensive prostitute... \n\"£8,000,\" the Boss chokes. \n\"Can't we keep the old switchboard - what would that cost then?\" the PFY suggests, conscious that the boss is borderline stroke material but the camcorder isn't charged... \n\"I suppose you could,\" the Sparky says sadly, seeing a downgrade to a ferry to Spain with the missus. \"But then you'll move the problem to your breakers because you can't get that type any more - which means when one fails you're going to have to rig up some form of alternative - which can't be done live.\" \n\"So we'd need to shutdown the computer room if one breaks?\" \n\"You'd need to shut it down every time one of them breaks,\" the Sparky responds, not giving up on Switzerland just yet. \n\"We can't do that!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Perhaps we could increase the capacity of the main breaker to 120KVA which will allow for a little bit of leeway in the switchboard. Then we ASSUME that none of the breakers is going to fail in the next two years or so, and admit that as the busbars are overrated anyway we should survive.\" \n\"I... suppose that might work.\" \n\"How much will that cost?\" the Boss asks. \n\"A grand,\" our sparky says, barely allowing himself enough profit to take a cab to and from work for the next month... \n\"Well lets do that then!\" \n\"Okay,\" the Sparky sighs. \"So onto the UPS maintenance.\" \n\"What UPS maintenance?\" the Boss snaps suspiciously. \n\"Your annual UPS maintenance - what I came here for when you sidetracked me for more powerpoints.\" \n\"What's that going to cost - and for what?\" \n\"A grand or so,\" the Sparky says. \"I change the coolant, do a discharge test, retune the time-remaining figures, scan the batteries and electronics with a thermal imaging camera, check the error log, reset the error log, upgrade the UPS and monitor BIOS if necessary and then produce a site report.\" \n\"And you want a grand for that?\" \n\"That's actually a pretty good deal,\" I say to the Boss. \n\"No it's not!\" \n\"It is,\" the PFY adds. \n\"We can't afford it!\" \n\"You're actually contracted to it for five years,\" the Sparky says. \n\"Well in that case we'll terminate the contract,\" the Boss snaps. \n\"Ah... that's not such a flash idea,\" the PFY says worriedly. \"He will have bought that contract off the UPS company.

There was a whole project team looking at it!\" \n\"A whole project team?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, to change all our printers for Multifunction Devices.

If you send the toner cartridges back a credit'll be sent back to the company tied back to the original invoice which will cause the auditing beancounter to show an interest. If we just chuck the toner cartridges into the bin then the auditor will notice an anomaly in his spreadsheet between the consumption of paper and toner cartridges, but if we use toner cartridges and paper simultaneously it'll look like we just had a run on printing!\" \n\"But won't people notice the huge volumes of printouts and wonder why?\" \n\"Not if we get people to initiate the printouts themselves - with some pointless activity. So say we implement five or six new IT policies that all staff are supposed to familiarise themselves with, make them a bit geeky so people don't want to read them off the screen and cram them full of screenshot examples so they chew through the toner...\" \n\"There's got to be a better way!\" the Boss sniffs. \n\"Well we could...\" the PFY starts. \n\"Could what?\" \n\"Just chuck paper and toner cartridges into the bin at the same time.\" \n\"You're just going to toss them out?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It'd look like they were just used up - no tricky questions...\" \n\"I... no, I can't!

Of course you can!\" \n\"I can't, I just can't do it!\" \n\"Why not - are you getting soft?\" \n\"No...You'll just make me clean it up. And finish the hole!\" \n\"True. So you're just going to isolate the UPS and computer room with no orderly shutdowns?\" \n\"Uhuh\" \n\"Fair enough!\" \n>Clickety< >Click< >Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep< >Clack!< \n\"What happened?\" the Boss asks, bursting into Mission Control. \n\"You must have shorted out the power somehow!\" the PFY says, obviously having thought this through. \n\"But the drill's still running!\" \n\"The wall plugs aren't on UPS supply\" the PFY counters. \n\"Ah, right\" he says, going back to supervise the work. \n\"Dodged that bullet,\" the PFY says. \"The last thing I want to be doing is hiding bodies on a Friday afte... >KZZZZZERRRRRRRRRT!< >CLACK!<. ... Oh crap!\" \n.. half a minute later in the computer room .. \n\"THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T PUT THE DRAIN HOLE THERE!\" I gasp peeking through the hole to the smoking - and very wet - building transformer below. \n\"And I suppose you want me to clean this up?\" the PFY sighs. \n\"Nope,\" I reply. \"Get security to call an ambulance - The raised floor mesh absorbed most of the charge and they're only stunned. Though you might strongly suggest that no one reset the building breaker any time soon.\" \n\"Meantime...pub o'clock?\" the PFY asks hopefully, helping himself to the wallets left carelessly laying around in the Boss' and Beancounter's pockets... \n\"WHY NOT!\" \n"}

Unless... \n\"Are you doing the server install for PR?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"What server install for PR?\" the PFY asks - and I KNOW he can't have Alzheimer's because he eats takeaways and avoids deodorant like vegetarian food. \n\"The Web Server,\" the Boss repeats with more than a touch of frustration. \"The new Public Relations Web server!\" \n\"WHAT NEW PUBLIC RELATIONS WEB SERVER?!\" the PFY and I snap. \n\"It's in your helpdesk queue!\" the Boss says, FINALLY giving us a bit of useful information. \n\"Ah, the SERVICE desk queue,\" I say, being ITIL compliant. \"When did that go in?\" \n\"This morning,\" he replies. \n\"Ah, and what priority did you give the Job?\" \n\"High.\" \n\"High,\" I say to the PFY. \"What's the response time on that?\" \n\"One working day,\" the PFY says. \n\"Oh, ok, so we'll probably get back to you on Monday,\" I say. \"Unless of course we fail to meet our response target in which case the job will escalate to you and you can follow-up with us Monday lunchtime.\" \n\"So... the server's not going to be ready by the weekend?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"No, no,\" the PFY says, calming the Boss down a little. \n\"Oh good.\" \n\"No,\" the PFY continues. \"What he's saying is we don't have to get back to you to have the whole 'What server?' 'The Web Server' 'What Web Server?' 'The PR Web Server' 'What PR Webserver?' conversation until monday. If we meet our response target.\" \n\"B-But... we need the server up and running before the weekend!\" the Boss gasps. \"The company's running an online promotional competition which they've advertised in a mailout!\" \n\"Hmmm,\" the PFY says. \"And they waited until now to worry about the server?\" \n\"Not exactly,\" the Boss says, guilt oozing from his pores. \n\"YOU waited until now to worry about the server?\" \n\"No,\" the Boss blurts. \"The developers said it would run on any web server, so PR put it on their web server last night but overnight it had a meltdown and we need a replacement server!\" \n\"What sort of meltdown?\" \n\"The whole thing collapsed - the disk filled up and the database log thing went berserk and the web server crashed and they can't fix it,\" the Boss gabbles. \"So we need a server before the weekend!\" \n\"In that case you should ring the service desk and get the priority changed to Urgent,\" I say to the Boss. \"Because then the response time drops to two hours.\" \n\"Just look at it now pleeeease ,\" the Boss pleads. \n\"I'd like to,\" I lie. \"I honestly would, but if I do that then I'd be resolving a non-urgent call before an urgent one - which would show up when they analyse the KPIs which are set as part of our annual bonus calculations. I need to fix the urgent call first or get your job made urgent.\" \n\"So what's the other urgent call?\" \n\"Someone wants us to put SNMP into the coffee machine so the know when the beans need to be refilled,\" the PFY responds. \n\"THAT'S NOT BLOODY URGENT!\" \n\"It was logged in the service desk as urgent,\" the PFY says. \"Apparently the CEO was here last week and someone offered him a coffee but couldn't give him one because the beans were out and the refills were locked away to stop people stealing them for home...\" \n\"Well, can't you change my call?\" \n\"Only the owner of a job or the service desk can change it's priority,\" the PFY says. \"Because apparently SOME people thought that we'd deprioritise calls we didn't want to do...\" \n\"I...\" the Boss says, getting the guilty look again. \"I'll go and change the priority and be right back!\" \n...two minutes later... \n\"So when will the server be ready?\" \n\"I think we can probably have it run up by next Wednesday.\" \n\"But it's URGENT, you need to get started now.\" \n\"I would but I have to deal with the Critical jobs first.\" \n\"What critical jobs?\" \n\"The coffee machine job,\" the PFY says. \"It's just been upgraded to Critical. Apparently the CEO asked for a raincheck on the coffee!\" \n\"But you never said there was a critical!\" \n\"There wasn't one then,\" I say. \"It got upgraded.\" \n\"So how does the urgency thing work?\" the Boss snaps. \n\"High is priority 2, Urgent is priority 1 and Critical is priority 0.\" \n\"So Critical's as important as it gets?\" \n\"Yup!\" \nRight!' the Boss says, stomping out. \n\"Quick,\" I say to the PFY. \"Change the required resolution time of the cof...\" \n\"Onto it!\" the PFY snaps, updating his service desk call. \"but I was just thinking - have you looked into the urgency mapping to see if it supports...\" \n\"Negative numbers?\" I ask. \"Already onto it and it does...One Super Duper Critical coming up!\" \n"}

THIS GUY ONLY STARTED YESTERDAY - he can't have annoyed you already!\" \n\"It's a pre-emptive strike,\" the PFY explains. \"He's bound to do something.\" \n\"No, he's not!\" the Boss gasps, reeling from the unfairness of it all. \n\"He is,\" I counter. \"He was brought on with the brief of examining asset management, inventory control and depreciation.\" \n\"But maybe he's not interested in you!\" \n\"...Azariah,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Eh?\" \n\"Nothing, just a bit of antipodean humour. But we digress, because of course he's going to be interested in us - IT assets are some of the most poorly recorded around because beancounters traditionally didn't know whether you were buying an item in its own right or an item which was part of an item.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"In our asset database will be graphics cards from thousands of years ago when 32 Meg of onboard memory was worth more than Posh Spice's underpants on eBay. And they were typically issued an asset number because of their book value, then slapped inside a machine with it's own asset number. When the machine was binned, it was written off, but the card wasn't. Same with large monitors, disk drives, etc.\" \n\"Which will in turn will mean,\" the PFY continues. \"That we'll get all the asset inventory and depreciation track down work which will take weeks of wandering around the building checking stickers, working out what we have and don't have...\" \n\"...Trying to remember what you've stolen you mean...\" the Boss suggests, unkindly. \n\"Alternatively, it's far simpler for us to plant the seed that all beancounters are secretly perverts with a fetish for donkeys.\" \n\"So you're going to send out a stack more of these are you?\" \n\"Why not?\" I ask. \"We'll keep framing beancounters until the company stops appointing them.\" \n\"Of course not, no that's just dealing with the symptoms, the real problem is the inventory system.\" \n\"And your solution to that is?\" \n\"Plan 32 Alpha, totally destroy the asset database.\" \n\"It's backed up,\" the Boss says. \n>BZEEERT< >BZEEERT< >BZEEERT< >BZEEERT< >BZEEERT< \n\"Not any more,\" the PFY. \n\"It's on RAID!\" \n>Clatter< \"Not with that disk removed it's not.\" \n\"But it'll still work with one disk removed.\" \n>Clatter< \"But not two.\" \n\"It will if you put it back in.\" \n>CRUNCH< \n\"Not now it won't.\" \n\"It you put the other disk back... >CRUNCH<\" \n\"Oh dear,\" the PFY says, putting his hammer down. \"We appear to have lost the asset management system.\" \n\"I... suppose it's pointless asking you to have a look at my laptop then?\" \n\"Of course not!\" the PFY gasps, picking up the hammer again. \"Bring her in - it may have depreciated so much you need a new one...\" \n"}

It's crashed then, has it?\" \nMy affirmative response is partially interrupted by the ringing of the server room phone which has a dual purpose - to contact us when we're inside the room and to indicate that the Guild of Idiots has taken up camp outside Mission Control with a view to finding out both what happened and when service will be restored. \nSigh. \nWe wander outside and to talk to the assembled group. \n\"So what happened?\" the head Beancounter wheezes, being a bit tuckered out after the walk from the lift. \n\"The SAN has crashed,\" I say. \n\"When will it be back?\" the head of HR asks. \n\"After it's been reset and done it's data rebuild,\" I say. \n\"Have you reset it?\" the Boss (and final Guild member) asks. \n\"Nope, it's remotely managed - remember?\" \n\"No?\" the Boss says. \n\"They do,\" the PFY says, pointing at the other two guild members. \n\"What do you mean?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The companies that produce our HR and finance software merged last year and created a single unified product,\" I explain. \n\"Their merger was so successful that they approached a hardware vendor to come up with what would be a complete turnkey solution,\" the PFY adds. \n\"A turnkey solution so simple that an idiot could administer it,\" I murmur. \n\"Although at the time we didn't realise it was a requirement,\" the PFY says as an aside, nodding at the two department heads. \n\"The idea was magic!\" I continue. \"An administrative web page which would allow the users to tailor, start, stop, backup and recover the application without systems people's intervention. And the plan was good - right up until the new company decided that the hardware merger wouldn't be returning the expected gain in profit and so alternative vendors were sought.\" \n\"Vendors who could deliver a healthy additional profit,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Vendors who didn't know the meaning of the word expensive.\" \n\"Or reliable,\" the PFY again adds. \n\"So when the combined forces of HR and finance decided that they wanted this solution we suggested that the proposed hardware might not be great for a production system.\" \n\"And we were ignored,\" the PFY adds. \n\"And so we now have a situation where the disk hardware appears to be as unreliable as the server hardware.\" \n\"The server hardware can't be that unreliable - I can't remember the last time it went down,\" the head of HR says. \n\"That's because you don't use it all the time, AND because we have a master reset feature at our disposal.\" \n\"Master Reset?\" the head of HR asks. \n\"Indeed. Follow.\" \nThe guild follow me into Mission Control and I show them the master reset system. \n\"Behold,\" I say pointing high above my head. \n\"Two pieces of string?\" the Boss asks... \n\"Two pieces of string which go through the wall, through the comms room, through the comms room wall, across the computer room and down to the HR\/Finance rack to one of two levers.\" \n\"Levers?\" \n\"Yes, levers poised above the reset button on the servers. A quick pull on this and your servers go down faster than Paris.\" \n\"You can't be serious!\" the Boss burbles. \n\"Sure am! I'm not wandering into the computer room three times a day to restart one of their machines!\" \n\"Well give it a pull then,\" the head of HR says. \"Because we're supposed to be doing a bank run for the salary payments and we've only got 23 minutes.\" \n\"I could give it a pull, but it's the disk that's crashed, not the machines. You want us to install a disk reset as well?\" \n\"I... suppose so,\" the head of HR responds reluctantly. \n\"I'll get it,\" the PFY says, heading off to the computer room with a battery drill and a ball of string... \nA few minutes later the PFY's back with a concerned look on his face. \n\"Yes?\" the head of HR asks. \n\"The SAN was crapper than I thought - the reset button broke off when I pulled the lever and is wedged between the panel and a case so it's stuck in reset mode.\" \n\"Take the panel off then!\" the head of HR gasps. \n\"It's riveted on!\" \n\"Drill them out!\" the head of HR snaps. \"You've got 11 minutes!\" \n\"Yeah well...

The only interaction I have is to change the incremental tape each morning when it's ejected and the full tape every monday when it's ejected .\" \n\"And when was the last time the full tape ejected?\" I sigh, fearing that this conversation is dragging a little. \n\"Uhhh,\" the PFY says, rolling his eyes a little. \"Three weeks ago.\" \n\"THREE WEEKS AGO!\" I gasp. \"You mean those idiot beancounters haven't scheduled a bloody full backup in THREE WEEKS! It'll take days to roll that forward!\" \n\"Oh they've scheduled them alright,\" the PFY says. \"They've just not run.\" \n\"WHY HAVEN'T THEY RUN?\" I ask, gritting my teeth a little. \n\"It's because of the financial policy change,\" the PFY says. \n\"Policy change?\" I prompt, wondering if the PFY has suddenly become unable to form a sentence complete with subject, object, verb, adverb and intelligence. \n\"Yeah, you know about three weeks and two days ago the Beancounters changed the way in which they would pay recurring invoices?\" \n\"No, but go on.\" \n\"They decided that if an invoice was a recurring one that varied in amount month to month the fixed component of the bill could be paid in advance but the varying portion should be paid for in arrears.\" \n\"And whatever that means has... some effect on backup scheduling?\" \n\"WHAT IT MEANS contractors like us who are paid in advance would get paid their normal time in advance but their overtime in arrears.\" \n\"Uh-huh - and this means?\" \n\"It means that there would be a two month gap between successive overtime payments when the policy was enacted.\" \n\"...Three weeks and two days ago?\" I reply. \n\"Yes. Which means that if you operate as I do - on a month to month basis - by then end of the month you have no money left.\" \n\"Yes, but you'll still get paid every month, just not your overtime - for one pay.\" \n\"But in the case where you commit your monthly income to substantial mortgage repayments on a studio apartment in the West End...\" \n\"Oh!\" I say. \"So you're broke for a month!\" \n\"Two months actually,\" the PFY sniffs. \n\"And because you're broke you can't even afford the time to put a tape in the backup drive?\" \n\"No...\" the PFY says. \n\"You can afford to put tapes in but you don't for... personal reasons?\" \n\"THERE'S A TAPE IN THE BLOODY DRIVE!\" the PFY snaps. \n\"So why haven't we taken a full backup properly?\" \n\"Because the backups are timed to occur at 1:00am on Monday morning.\" \n\"Still not with you...\" \n\"Well at 12am, I've been doing some database maintenance which takes about 90 minutes to complete.\" \n\"So why not run the maintenance after the backups?\" \n\"I can't, because the accounts payable payments are processed and transferred to the bank at 3am.\" \n\"And you wouldn't want to impact my chances of getting paid,\" I say. \n\"No. So I run it at 12 and it takes till 1:30.\" \n\"Yet still the backups don't start at 1?\" \n\"No, because I have to change the system clock to be 3:01am before I do my maintenance.\" \n>CUE RAT AROMA!< \n\"What exactly does your database maintenance entail?\" I ask, fearing the worst. \n\"I select all the accounts payable transactions in the database which ran three weeks and three days ago, order them by payee and drop anyone who isn't me.\" \n\"And run the payment with the timestamp which would have occurred had it been a legitimate payment going to the bank.\" \n\"Yes. And then when that's done I set the clock back to the proper time, which is generally 2:30 or so and the real run goes through.\" \n\"Wouldn't that mean you had lots of duplicate payments for the same day.\" \n\"It would - if I didn't delete the row when I get into work - from there and the audit table.\" \n\"A plan so complicated I need a memory upgrade and a maths coprocessor to understand it. So why did you delete the tables?\" \n\"I was looking through the financials package manual...\" \n\"A manual?!

They made it mandatory last year when I managed to replay a desktop order enough times to build my own Beowulf cluster - though they couldn't prove anything.\" \n\"So what do I do?\" \n\"You mean, what do you do now that you've push the company into a possible crisis of investor confidence by manipulating our financial systems and ruining any possibility of a quick backup?\" \n\"Uh... yes.\" \n\"Start a small fire with the paper audit logs - they're kept in the head beancounter's bottom drawer, then buzz every second incremental tape with the bulk eraser so they can't roll forward.\" \n\"But won't they still be peed off that we didn't do backups?\" \n\"Not when we blame it on the SAN again - because of >flip< >flip< fibrechannel aspherical monochromousity.\" \n\"Ah, F.A.M!\" the PFY says. \"And I'm guessing you'll be faking web pages for Google to find?\" \nAlready done it.

We could probably format the five machines, get rid of the Microsoft OS and install a much faster Knoppix install in no time.\" \n\"I...\" the pilot says, not knowing what the hell the PFY just said. \"Do you need anything?\" \n\"Five...?\" the PFY says, looking at me. \n\"Make it six - best to be on the safe side,\" I say. \n\"Six,\" the PFY says decisively. \"Cans of Tennants Super.\" \n\"Each,\" I say. \n\"And some salt and vinegar crisps to go with the tramp juice.\" \n\"Beer and crisps!?\" the pilot gasps. \n\"BACK OFF MAN, WE'RE PROFESSIONALS!\" I snarl, whipping out my Knoppix USB key. \n\"What do you want us to do?\" the Co Pilot asks. \n\"Get as high up as possible,\" I say. \"We're going to have to reboot them all to change quorum when we go from Windows to Knoppix, so we'll need all the glide time we can get...\" \n\"I... ok\" \n\"And get a wiggle on with those lagers.\" \n...a few minutes later... \n\"Right,\" the PFY says, dropping the third empty can to the ground. \"I'm ready!\" \n\"Me too,\" I say. \"Control-alt-delete time.\" \n\"I was just going to press the reset on the motherboards.\" \n\"Works for me!\" I say. \n>click< >click< >click< >click< >click< \n>WHAAAAAAOORRRRR< >WUMPF WUMPF WUMPF!< \n\"Whoa,\" I say, turning to the PFY. \"That was some turbulence. I was having a pretty strange dream.\" \n\"Me too,\" the PFY says, rubbing his eyes. \"We were at the conference and a crisis broke out and they needed someone who knew how to recover a Commodore CBM save tape and it just so happened I blah blah blah.\" \n\"Sorry about that,\" I say to the PFY. \"I was momentarily distracted by a uniformed woman striding down from first class with a worried expression on her face.

What was wrong with it?\" \n\"Nothing,\" the PFY says. \"We just wanted to see how it works. It's quite good too - it boots off >tap< >tap< this hard drive here, but it's also got a slot for a flash card if you want to make it truly solid state.

That way if it claps out we'll just claim it was damaged in transit.\" \n\"They'll check the box!\" \n\"This box?\" the PFY asks, pointing at a box with a large number of boot marks in it. \n\"But they'll still know you opened the machine!\" \n\"Nah they won't. The final assembly work is performed in Leeds - probably so that the company can bypass some import tariff or the other - so all we have to do is make it look like the last person who had it open was from Leeds.\" \n\"And how do you propose to accomplish that?\" \n\"Smear the lid with lardy fingerprints and drop a couple of chips and some pork scratchings inside the case.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Oh, I almost forgot.

Okay, lets just open her up.\" \n. . . a couple of drillings later . . . \n\"Ah, it's the daughterboard,\" he says, pointing. \"It's plugged in one row of pins to the left of when it should be.\" \n\"What's that for?\" the PFY asks, pointing at a chip laying in the case. \n\"I... uhhh, that's just some packing,\" the engineer bluffs. \n\"It looks like a potato chip.\" \n\"Yeah, but it's not. It's one of those enviro carbon things. They're made out of... biomass and hexofibre - good for the atmosphere. And there's another one.\" \nHe dumps the food into his pocket, shuts the lid and plugs the unit into a tiny debug console he's brought with him. \n\"Righty-ho,\" he says. \"Let's see how she goes.\" \n>click< >whirrrrr< \nAn image promptly appears on the debug device and a self test starts. \n\"All looks ok,\" the engineer said. \n\"So how did it get out of the factory like that?\" the PFY says. \"Isn't there supposed to be some form of testing?\" \n\"Yeah well, there should be, but it's possible this one got overl...\" \nHe stops abruptly as a flabby backside wobbles its way across the screen... \n\"...might have just been damaged in transit,\" he says, pushing the eject button hurriedly. \n\"So we're all sorted then?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Yep, all up and running.\" \n\"Can I get you a coffee?\" the Boss asks, as the device is powered down. \n\"Why not?\" our engineer says. \n. . . \n\"So have you learnt a lesson today?\" I ask the PFY once they've both gone. \n\"I have,\" the PFY says. \"Engineers get the best toys.

It's taken about two solid weeks of work to produce, but it's worth it because you can tell when every single IT asset is due for replacement!\" \n\"Sure I'll do it right... Ah. Maybe later, it's crashed.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"My guess is that the bearings in the hard drive are almost dead and so once the drive warms up a bit they start getting a little cranky and the drive gives off read errors, ultimately crashing the machine.\" \n\"Can you reboot it?\" \n\"Not really,\" the PFY says, pointing at the disk fail message on the boot screen. \n\"So it's gone then?\" \n\"No, no it's probably still there - we could possibly get the motor and bearings replaced if it were worth enough to you?\" \n\"How much would it cost?\" \n\"A couple of thousand quid - and we'd have to send it away.\" \n\"Can't you do anything else?\" \n\"We could chuck it in the freezer?\" \n\"Can we be serious?\" the Boss asks. \n\"He is,\" I say. \"SOMETIMES when you put a drive in a freezer overnight the bearings will shrink slightly and allow the drive to be run up for a while.\" \n\"Long enough to get the data off?\" \n\"Quite possibly.\" \n\"Okay do it!\" \n... early the next day... \n\"Alright then,\" the PFY says putting the chilled drive back into the desktop. \"Lets take a look.\" \n\"It's booting!\" the Boss gasps, pointing out the bleeding obvious. \"Windows is starting!!

It will save companies millions in replacing machines that don't need to be replaced and upgrades that don't need to occur! It's the culmination of my life's work.\" \n\"Really?\" the PFY says dubiously. \"I think you're overestimating it slightly, but who knows? Anyway, I'll just plug the USB drive in and let you get copying.\" \nTen minutes later the PFY and I have left the Boss to it and are returning to Mission Control. \n\"So do you really think that it'll revolutionise IT asset management?\" \n\"Nah,\" I say. \"These things come and go and they're so tightly linked to a company's financial modelling that they don't easily translate to another company.\" \n\"But it'll still cause us some headaches.\" \n\"No, no, having an asset tracking and replacement spreadsheet is one thing, but you've really got to have an opening to use it. Still, I think we should be prepared to wake up and see the writing on the wall.\" \n\"That asset management is a political issue?\" \n\"No I was thinking more of The systems guys locked me in the chiller carved into ice.

'Small' in that case meaning a complete revision of the floor plan, with new offices, aircon and cabling throughout.\" \n\"Yes, we apparently did do a few more changes than originally planned back then – scope creep I think they said – but the changes they're proposing now are are just a bit of fine tuning to come up with the ultimate configuration for both staff comfort and work process.\" \n\"So we changed from open plan to offices and now we're...?\" \n\"It's a combination of open plan and offices. A hybrid model if you like.\" \n\"They're going to move all the walls again, aren't they?\" I sigh. \n\"No, no, nothing as drastic as that,\" the Boss says, laying down the plans. \"We'll keep all these walls here, those over here and of course those.\" \n\"Right, so with the exception of the external walls and the load-bearing internal walls, all the other walls go?\" \n\"I... uhhhhhmm, yes, it would appear so.\" \n\"So we're only keeping the concrete?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"The stuff without cavities for faceplates?\" \n\"What's your point?\" \n\"My point is that all the wiring has to be done again – all the comms, all the power.\" \n\"It's underfloor, surely!\" \n\"It used to be underfloor looms, sure. Then, when they did the renovations they decided that the floor plates looked ugly and that they caused problems for wheely chairs, so they had to go.\" \n\"But the cable looms must still exist?\" \n\"You'd think so wouldn't you? But then one of the CEO's architect mates said that everyone was using solid wood floors for natural heat retention or something so they replaced the integrated tiling with wood, built permanent walls – for their improved sound proofing – and fed all the cabling from the ceiling space into the new walls.\" \n\"But surely that would be...\" \n\"Madness?\" I suggest. \n\"No...\" \n\"Hideously expensive?\" \n\"No...\" \n\"The least intelligent method of partitioning offices in a dynamic environment?\" \n\"I.... don't know what to say.\" \n\"I do,\" I say. \" We told them so . We told them that on average we 'renovate' about a floor a year in this place – more if there's been a change of head man or head man's PA – and that putting permanent floors and walls in would be a mistake and would cost us a fortune in comms reinstallation.\" \n\"Ah well I have some good news there,\" the Boss smiles. \"They said we can reuse our old stuff.\" \n\"What, you mean they'll let us reuse the cable that some chippy's yanked out of the wall, tied up in a ball and taped to a ceiling member then untaped, unwound and stuffed back into a wall in another location?\" \n\"I... Well you see the architect hasn't allowed any money for new cables in the renovation budget,\" the Boss says, scanning over the document. \n\"Are you sure?\" I ask, grabbing the document off him. \"Hang on – IT'S THE SAME GUY!\" \n\"What?\" \n\"It's the same guy who recommended solid walls and floors who's behind this and the cabling reuse. I'll kill him!\" \n\"I think we should be reasonable about this.\" \n\"REASONABLE?!\" I gasp. \"If we do this we'll spend the next six months identifying cable faults and organising cable replacements out of my maintenance money!!!\" \n\"But isn't network cable supposed to have a 20 year lifetime?\" \n\"IN THE BLOODY WALL!\" I snap. \"Your bloody LADA will last 20 years if you leave it in a garage, it's only when you play with it that it stops bloody working!\" \n\"I think you're being a little overdramatic – these builders are professionals.\" \n\"Yes, you're probably right,\" I say. \"They're really IT wizards attracted to the building industry by the opportunities of wearing tight shorts and flashing butt cleavage. So when are they proposing to start this work?\" \n\"I.... They started this morning!\" the Boss says. \n\"And we only heard about this today!?\" \n\"Well I might have heard about it a week or two ago...\" \n\"So that dull thumping noise I can hear above me isn't the sound of my assistant encouraging someone to fill in a survey form correctly?\" \n\"That would be the builders,\" the Boss says. \n\"Let's take a quick look, shall we?\" \n...minutes later... \n\"Well this all looks OK,\" the Boss says. \"The cable's all wound up nicely.\" \n\"The electrical cable is, yes,\" I say. \n\"What about the data cable then?\" the Boss asks, unable to identify the aforementioned. \n\"It's the thin grey cable,\" I say. \"The stuff they're using to tie the electrical cable together with. Oh, and hold those ceiling lights on with. And to steady that ladder.\" \n\"Ah, I...\" \n\"And that bloke over there is using some as a belt and some more of it to run remote speakers off his boom box. But I'm sure he'll join it all back up with strip connectors when he's done.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Oh and look. There's the architect!\" I say. \n\"Now let's not do anything hasty,\" the Boss burbles. \n>KZEERRRRT!< >KZEERT!< \n. . .The next day. . . \n\"And you're sure this room is to stay?\" the builder asks me. \n\"Positive,\" I say. \"I had a chat to my Boss and the architect and we agreed that it should remain here forever.\" \n\"But there's no doors!\" \n\"Don't need them, it's going to be a duct.\" \n\"But... wasn't there a door there yesterday?\" \n\"There was, but the architect and the Boss popped in last night and had someone put a panel in. The extra soundproofing it provides is priceless,\" I add. \n\"Yes, it's good stuff,\" the builder says. \"And you know what they say?\" \n\"In space no one can hear you scream? Or in a duct for that matter.\" \n\"What? No, they say no one regrets buying quality.\" \n\"So true. And speaking of quality, about that total cabling refit...\" \n"}

Car remotes fail because water gets in the remote or the button gets pressed down when you sit on your keys - and the battery goes flat. Or you press the wrong button.

When was this?\" \n\"Last Friday lunchtime,\" the PFY says, gazing into the distance thoughtfully. \"I remember because it was the deadline he'd given us to install some patches on our system. It didn't happen and he came to the pub to find out why and get us back onto the job.

As he entered the stairwell below me I realised that (a) I hadn't needed to bring the paper up to that floor to dispose of it in the first place and (b) the lift would be a better way to get it to the basement. In executing a 180 degree turn one of the boxes of paper slipped from the top of the trolley and fell onto the director.\" \n\"Oh. How about your helpdesk supervisor?\" \n\"Again, a workplace tragedy. He'd asked us to ensure that all our calls were passed through the helpdesk system so that they could be logged in his database - and in order to do this had our DDI numbers redirected by a telco contractor without our knowledge. My assistant here went to speak to him about how we could facilitate the return of the DDI numbers and accidentally knocked a desk lamp into the fish tank at the exact moment that he happened to be cleaning it...\" \n\"Someone - anyone - FROM the helpdesk?\" \n\"Gone also - but nothing to do with us. They're all on sick leave after ordering a dodgy pizza from the place across town that has a web ordering service and free delivery. Apparently there was some glitch in the webform which resulted in the words 'powdered glass' being entered into the freeform text box under 'additional toppings'. Ordinarily this would have not been a problem as they don't have this stuff on hand in the store except that the exceptionally customer-focused delivery person stopped off on the way and added it.\" \n\"That's terrible!\" \n\"I know,\" the PFY says. That someone with the dedication to go the extra mile for the customer is treated so shabbily. As luck would have it though, once we heard of his availability we were able to offer him a position in our helpdesk starting next week.

Meantime, however, my assistant is their non-UK-tax-resident paying-guest.\" \n\"I... And what about you?\" the Boss asks, looking to me. \n\"As a registered charity I'm not really required to pay that much tax either – so no financial nightmares waiting for me in the closet either.\" \n\"A registered charity?\" \n\"Don't ask,\" the PFY cautions, not wanting to hear once more the heartrending tales of women who've crossed the line to depravity... \n\"So, if it's not you two... then who's getting rid of all the Revenue people?\" \n\"No one knows,\" the PFY says. \"We've had one of their cars in the basement for a couple of years now and there's a whole stack of briefcases in security's offices.\" \n\"And no one's tried to contact Revenue about it?\" \n\"I think it's a case of not wanting to draw attention to yourself,\" the PFY says. \"Almost all the security staff are moonlighting other jobs, half senior management have some undisclosed 'consultancy' role somewhere that keeps them in holidays, and all but one of the cleaning staff are under the table.\" \n\"And not just cleaning there,\" I add for the Boss' benefit. \n\"So what you're actually saying is that if Inland Revenue were to cast their gaze over the company...\" \n\"...The prison sentences would look like a Terry Waite package holiday...\" \n\"Well, from what I've heard about you I'm surprised you've not availed yourself of one of the incentives that Revenue have to offer from time to time,\" the Boss mumbles thoughtfully. \"You could have earnt some kudos - sometimes they even offer cash!\" \nFrom the expression on the Boss' face I can see that his thoughts are moving from the theoretical to the practical... \n\"No, like I said - half the company is trying something on. If one of us them went down they'd take others down with them and the whole place would go down the gurgler. Instead, however, we'll just sit astride this gravy train and see where it takes us.\" \n\"Yes, yes, I suppose you're right – don't want to rock the boat as the new guy.\" the Boss nods. \n... \n\"I smell a derailment,\" I say to the PFY. \"Time to keep an eye on him.\" \n\"Why?\" the PFY says. \"I'm watertight – and your charity thing seems to have some prima facie semblance of legitimacy.\" \n\"Like I said, when one goes down, they'll all go down. Before you know it someone will be questioning your non-resident status and suggesting that I don't have the best interest of those stringfellows women at heart. Worse still, I have a sneaky suspicion that this isn't going to be able to wait till he trips into the path of an oncoming taxi...\" \n\"What are we going to do?\" the PFY whines, starting to get agitated. \n\"I don't know!\" I snap. \"Security are watching us like hawks since the last decimation of IT staff, so I don't want to risk a simple electrocution or stairwell fall. WE NEED A PLAN...\" \n...Five minutes later... \n\"I DON'T HAVE A PLAN!!!\" the PFY sniffs. \n\"WE NEED TO THIN...\" I say, stopping as the CEO enters Mission Control, and flips the chart from 10 to 00. \n\"I'm terribly sorry to be the bearer of bad news,\" he says. \"But I'm afraid your manager's had a nasty accident. He was just now telling me about some apparent tax dodginess when he accidentally tripped and wrapped my phone cord around his neck several times. I tried to get to him but must have tripped as well and knocked myself out. Next thing I knew security was reviving me to find that he somehow managed to end up with his head in the fish tank...\" \n\"Terrible business,\" I say. \"Which just goes to show that it's not just cellphones we should be afraid of. You'll be needing some alcohol wipes then?\" \n\"What for?\" \n\"Oh, just to wipe the phone cord and fish tank down with – wouldn't want any of those forensic people catching security's germs off them.\" \n\"Yes... Yes... Good point. Uh... give us a couple, I might do my desk and the visitor's chair at the same time.\" \n... \nSo at least we didn't have to do EVERYTHING ourselves... \n"}

It's Christmas CARD season again,\" I say. \"For the next three weeks we can expect the usual deluge of cards from the vendors we deal with on a day to day basis, the vendors we deal with on an occasional basis, and the vendors who've never dealt with us but wish to do so in the future - all wishing us the very best for the Christmas season.\" \n\"And presents,\" the PFY says happily. \n\"No, not presents,\" I correct. \"Not this week. Have you not noticed that the places that send us cards early in the season never actually send us presents?\" \n\"I... No, I hadn't.\" \n\"Just take a look. If you get a nice looking card - and it's not an invite to a party where the booze and women flow like water from a natural spring - then there's no box of chocolates or fancy lager from them gracing your desk at the end of year. If there's no card though, there's a distinct possibility the vendor's going to courier you a hamper full of Christmas treats to keep you going over the break.\" \n\"So if we get cards, we're stuffed?\" \n\"Probably. Instead of sending the Christmas contraband to the people who've done the design, specification, evaluation, and acceptance of vendors proposals, they'll give the cakes, booze, toys, and trinkets to some person in middle management whose sole contribution has been to add a signature to a piece of paper that they didn't understand.\" \n\"It doesn't sound fair,\" the PFY simpers. \n\"Of course it's not fair!\" I snap. \"It's never fair. You don't see the Boss trolling through technical specs to ensure that some proposed hardware has sufficient capacity for expansion into the future. The director's not reading reviews of hardware reliability on geek blogs into the small hours! No, they just sign bits of paper in the knowledge that come Christmas time they'll be raking in the cakes. AND IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!\" \n\"Too true,\" the PFY echoes. \"So what do we do about it?\" \n\"What do we do?\" I snap. \"We take steps, that's what we do!\" \n\"So you've no idea?\" \n\"Of course I have!\" I respond. \"I've gone through the long list of Bosses, Heads of IT, and now Directors that we've had in the past two years and left strict instructions with the mail room, security, and stores that any Christmas mail or parcels destined for them are to be delivered straight to me.\" \n\"Why not do it properly and get the current Boss and IT Directors?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Two reasons,\" I say. \"First, they'll notice the drop off in mail and are almost certain to go to some event where they'll be asked if they received their contraband...\" \n\"And secondly?\" \n\"They're new, keen, and have upset a large number of people in the company. There's every chance they'll get a cake or two which shouldn't be eaten..\" \n\"Mmm?\" \n\"Remember that time the Boss got that beautiful Gateau cake the topping of which was in actual fact a thick layer of grated laxative chocolate?\" \n\"No. When was that?\" \n\"Ten minutes ago.\" \n\"Oh, I see,\" the PFY nods. \"But won't he be suspicious if it comes this early?\" \n\"No, I just made up an IT company name and put a card in saying that we're celebrating our relaunch.\" \n\"So it's a fair bet he won't be taking the tube home tonight then?\" \n\"Or trusting vendor presents any more...\" \n\"Oh, so it's about making them not trust the presents they get!\" the PFY says, finally clicking on. \"What about the Director?\" \n\"Ah! You know those fold up canvas chairs we got from the LTO3 vendor in July?\" \n\"The tripod ones with the aluminium poles?\" \n\"Precisely. The Head of IT received a pair of these which he'll no doubt test drive.\" \n\"And he shouldn't?\" \n\"Not without a proctologist on standby anyway. There might be a slight technical hitch with the rivet in the middle.\" \n\"Oooh,\" the PFY gasps. \"Hopefully the rivet won't travel too far?\" \n\"It's unreasonable of you to ask me to guarantee that,\" I say. \"But I feel fairly confident that our Christmas fortunes will be looking up after today...\" \n\"So it's a matter of just sitting back and waiting?\" \n\"Or sitting back and screaming,\" I say, as a cry from the Director's office indicates stage one is complete. \nA few minutes later the Boss and the Boss's PA help the Director struggle to the lift... \n\"So that's stage two sorted,\" I say wandering back into Mission Control and tapping away on the keyboard. \n\"Stage two?\" \n\"You didn't notice the corona of chocolate round the Boss' gob?\" I ask. \"Looks like he's started on that Gateau already.\" \n\"And don't tell me - the lift is about to develop a technical fault?\" \n\"Could be...

Surely there's something in your helpdesk queue?\" \n\"Help yourself,\" the PFY says, turning his monitor around. \n\"What about that one - printing delays?\" \n\"The one that requires us to refresh the print server and all the print drivers because someone in Beancounter-land updated their printer driver and found that their printer had a hitherto unused duplexing function, then, as a public service updated the drivers on all other printers regardless of what type or manufacturer they were?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Which would involve us having to do a walkaround to each printer which is now uncommunicative to find its exact make and model, then find the drivers, THEN update the print server with them?\" \n\"Surely it's possible?\" \n\"So's giving yourself a circumcision under local, but you don't find many people doing it,\" the PFY quips. \"If we changed things now it'd cause a major printing outage over the weekend which would mean that half the beancounters wouldn't be able to take their work...\" \n\"...Porn,\" I correct. \n\"..home with them,\" the PFY finishes. \"Which means we'd be called in several times over the weekend to fix the colour printers.\" \n\"Okay, so maybe that's not a Friday afternoon job,\" the Boss says. \"What about that?\" \n\"Change the access password for the HR documents webstore,\" the PFY says. \"Nope. If you do that on a Friday afternoon you actually decrease security because half of HR have already gone home - which means that the other half will leave notes on their screen about the password change.\" \n\"Okay, what about that?\" \n\"Update the BIOS on a stack of desktop machines in Beancounter central.\" \n\"Yeah - that seems simple enough.\" \n\"It is - if the reason for the update was anything more compelling than a boot screen image.\" \n\"Mmm?\" \n\"They want a BIOS upgrade to fix the utility that lets you put your own picture in the background of the boot screen.\" \n\"I... Perhaps that's a bad example..\" \n\"They're all bad examples,\" the PFY says. \"And the day is just dragging on and on.\" \n\"I hate Friday afternoons,\" I add. \n\"Isn't there a bit of housekeeping you could do - some tidying? Some documentation?\" \n\"Nope.\" \n\"What about this?\" the Boss asks, picking up some install media off the PFY's desk. \"Surely this should go away somewhere\" \n\"Sure,\" the PFY says, taking it and tossing it in the bin. \n\"It's the eternal problem,\" I say to the Boss. \"You don't want to start a big job because you won't have any time to complete it and you don't want to start a small job because it's Friday afternoon and you just can't be arsed.

You see here, at this company, we use the Government model for budgeting where if you don't spend all your budget in a year you obviously didn't need it in the first place and so next year's budget is cut. If you overspend your budget the overspend gets taken from next year's budget. If you just spend all your budget in a year then that's obviously a good number and one which should be used for subsequent years.\" \n\"I... see... And your point is?\" \n\"EVERY department pinches pennies all year and doesn't replace anything unless they really have to. Come the end of the year they all have money left over which will be taken off them by the beancounters - and worse still, removed from their budget the following year - so they rush to spend it on anything that can be purchased and delivered before the end of the year.\" \n\"Yes, but I still don't see how this has anything to do with those boxes.\" \n\"Okay, so IF the gear arrives here and gets receipted in this calendar year then the department pays for it in this year's budget - and they meet their budget target.\" \n\"Yes...\" \n\"But if the gear is delayed and gets receipted AFTER this calendar year then it comes out of NEXT year's budget, which will be significantly lower than last years - because last year's wasn't all spent.\" \n\"You've lost me!\" \n\"Okay, say you have a department budget of 30 grand to spend on office and IT products. You scrimp and save all year so that you've only spent 10k by the end of the year. You order 10 superduper desktops with large screens, etc, to spend the remaining 20k so that the beancounters don't cut next year's office and IT budget to 10k.\" \n\"Uh... yes,\" the Boss says, thinking furiously. \n\"So IF the gear arrives this year you get 10 flash desktops AND you get an office and IT budget of 30K next year - but if the gear doesn't get receipted until January then the beancounters will have cut your office and IT budget to 10k and you'll have a bill for 20k worth of flash machines to pay for in that calendar year.\" \n\"And these boxes haven't been receipted yet?\" \n\"Oh no,\" the PFY responds. \"They're still in delivery.\" \n\"Until when?\" \n\"Till about 4:45pm on the last day...\" \n\"...What happens then?\" \n\"Generally, we ring the department up and tell them that only part of their order turned up. Like say 5 machines - which they can accept or send back for a refund. Now NO ONE wants a refund because that means they'll get less money next year - so they take the 5 machines. Then, we tell them that to make sure the beancounters are happy we'll SAY we received 10 machines and just fake the inventory system. They get some of their machines and their budget's not cut. Everyone's a winner!\" \n\"And what happens to the other five machines?\" \n\"That's the beautiful thing - we use those to replace our machines!\" the PFY says. \n\"But... don't you have an office and IT budget?\" \n\"Course we do, but we spend most of ours in the first week of January in case there's a budget cut during the year.\" \n\"So at the end of the year you have nothing?\" \n\"Nah, by the end of the year we're usually around 20 grand under.\" \n\"So you have less money next year?\" \n\"Nah, we just spend the amount we put in our budget for the year.\" \n\"But that'll mean that you'll be twenty grand over budget next year - which will be cut from the year after's budget!\" \n\"I think you mean forty grand over budget,\" the PFY says. \"Because we overspend by that twenty grand again.\" \n\"It's a game we like to play with the Beancounters,\" I explain. \"They try and curtail our spending by cutting our budget, we get machines from other areas and keep spending regardless. \" \n\"But surely they'll catch onto what's happening and ask for some form of audit of machines, where they came from, and what you're doing with your money?\" \n\"Yeah, that does happen,\" I admit. \n\"And surely there's some form of penalty or financial oversight to be answered to?\" \n\"Yeah... not so much.\" \n\"But aren't they just going to not allocate you a budget at all and just refuse to pay the invoices you've generated?\" \n\"Indeed they do.\" \n\"So what happens then?\" \n\"Whose machines do you think are blocking up our office?\" \n"}

The contract Unix sysadmin was upset with his employer and co-workers at the time. Denison reportedly snapped shortly after discovering his computer privileges had been revoked. \nHis actions prevented the ISO from communicating with the electricity market for about two hours, leaving California vulnerable to blackout conditions. In the event no blackout occurred because the incident happened late on a Sunday night, when demand was low, so California had no need to buy in excess generating capacity from other states. \nNonetheless, the incident cost the centre $14,000, UPI reports . It took 20 computer specialists about seven hours to restore the system. \nProsecutors allege Denision compounded his offences by sending a threatening email to an unnamed California ISO employee the next day implying he planted a bomb at the facility. The email said: \"Hey, at one point I respected you... you have a new kid. So this is only because of him. Get out before the timer expires. Not long now. Take care.\" \nISO responded by evacuating 500 workers from the facility and transfered control of the grid to a second control centre. \nDenison pleaded guilty to attempted damage of an energy facility, a felony offence punishable with up to five years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, at a hearing in Sacremento on Friday. The rogue employee faces a sentencing hearing scheduled for 29 February. ® \n"}

Clean the read heads, which probably are dirty B. Have the tape sent to a commercial data recovery centre C. A, then reduce the temperature of the computer room, and try to complete the read D. Report the failure to the user E. Just cut and repeatedly paste data from the beginning of the data file until the file's up to size \n10. The greatest danger to the RA60 removable hard disk media was: A. Not being locked into the drive spindle tightly B. Not being able to be removed from the drive spindle after use C. Disk damage if the cover lock unlatched itself during use D. Dirty read heads E. A preventative maintenance by the Engineer \n11. The correct combination of carefully timed disk seeks on the drives in an RA80 disk drive rack could cause: A. A 'tune' to play B. A small vibration C. A large vibration D. A very large vibration E. The disk rack to run in 'horizontal' mode \n12. A user has been looking through the sad remnants of their life and found a large box of several thousand punch cards of their undergraduate work, which they would like you to do something with. A good administrator would: A. Call a computer museum and get them read B. Write a quick program to interface to a scanner and read them C. Give the user the punch card hole code info so they could type them in D. Throw them in the bin and tell the user that they've been demagnetised E. Throw them at the user from a fourth-floor window \nAre you an expensive Bastard? \n13. The correct way to put a yearly budget plan together is to: A. Add up the cost of all the expected projects and maintenance for the year to come and put that figure forward B. Use last year's figure and add five per cent C. Use the last year's figure as well as the previous year to discern a trend, and ask for that D. Look at the performance bonus of the board members for an indication of potential E. Multiply last year's budget by two after anonymously sending those photos from the Beancounter's photocopy room after the Christmas bash \n14. A vendor tells you the product he's pushing will lower your TCO. This means: A. Your total cost of ownership, taking into account purchase price, maintenance, expected lifetime and possible rental options, will be less B. The TCO will probably not be affected, once you take training, early termination of previous contract and installation fees into account C. He's on commission and things have been lean this year D. He's a lying bastard E. C, D and you can probably screw a few lunches out of him before you say no \n15. An annual maintenance contract has come up for renewal and the Vendor takes pains to point out that they have not increased their charges like so many other vendors. This means: A. They're trying to be competitive B. A, and they're looking for extra business C. They've found a subcontractor who will work for shiny beads and offal D. They're scared of going into receivership after that anonymous letter to the tax dept E. A, C, D, and they re-added those three extra pieces of equipment you cancelled maintenance on earlier in the year (due to an \"administrative error\" ) \nBOFH is copyright © 1995-2007, Simon Travaglia.

Sure, it's a chance to overindulge in company supplied beverages, witness burgeoning office romances (that both parties will be deeply ashamed of in the new year – worse still when the webpage comes out..) and help some jilted office assistant sort through her pocket book for her ex's fax number - but you also have to put up with the crap as well... \nCrap like a beancounter telling you exactly what the current market rate of service-level-guaranteed internet is - based on the cost of his ADSL connection at home - and how we're simply paying too much for our connectivity. \n\"...I mean for that money you could put in dozens of ADSL lines - surely that would be cheaper. You could aggregate them like phone lines,\" the beancounter burbles. \n\"Oh look!\" the PFY gasps. \"It's a laminated photo of the locomotive LNER 4468 Mallard!\" \n\"Wher.. >KZERT!<\" \n... \nBut a lot of conversations can't be ended as happily. In fact, an hour later it's far worse. Now that the alcohol has had time to affect people's mental processes their darker natures are starting to emerge... \n\"...which is why you can't trust software people!\" a cretin from the HR department drools emphatically at me. \"The information the software gathers is passed from one place to another and then a profile of you is built up in places that you've never been to and never heard of.\" \n\"You mean like Leeds?\" I ask. \n\"What? No!\" \n\"Oh, you mean it's like ECHELON?\" \n\"Wa?\" \n\"Echelon - you know, the NSA thing which intercepts phone calls, electronic data, etc, scans them with fuzzy logic for key words or phrases then assigns some weighting as to whether you qualify for an all-expenses-paid holiday of abuse with absolutely no legal recourse in Guantanamo.

Please, continue...\" I sigh. \n\"They collect information about you with their software then they feed it back to their company.\" \n\"Uh-huh,\" I mumble, looking to see what drinks remain. \n\"But not just that, they send people to your company to gather information on you.\" \n\"Oh you mean Helene and Mike?\" I say, pointing across the room. \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Helene and Mike - over there. Helene's the one by the fax\/copier looking through her address book and Mike's the one drinking the alcohol based cleaning products. Apparently last month was a good vintage for window cleaner. Now they work for one of our software vendors.\" \n\"Have you told them anything?\" \n\"Only where you live, how much you earn, your bank account numbers – nothing important\" \n\"You what?! Don't you know they us.. >KZERT<\" \n\"Don't mention it,\" the PFY says as he steps over the cretin on his way to freshen up his drink. \nI take it back – a lot of conversations can be ended happily after all. Things might be looking up. \n... \nAn hour later I find they are when I happen upon the PFY helping his half-cut half zapped beancounter victim make a couple of last minute eBay purchases. \n\"A Beta video recorder!\" he gasps over the beancounter's shoulder. \"Give it a couple of years and it'll be worth a fortune on antiques roadshow. Click Buy-it-now - you don't want to be outbid and £100 is a small price to pay! Oooh, and look, the same person is selling an eight track player and some Newtons – collectables if I ever saw them...\" \nYou know, I'd almost feel bad if I hadn't seen the PFY scouring the basement for items to list on eBay this morning... \nWondering what the Boss' idle hands are up to and where the Christmas bonuses are, I make for his office and step past our two vendors as they rifling through drawers for a good vintage of tippex... \n\"Ah, there you are,\" the Boss burbles. \"Just handing out the bonuses. Last minute thing so you'll have to make do with cash. Apparently someone tried to break into the cheque safe and broke the lock mechanism. You wouldn’t know anything about that would you?\" \n\"Me?\" I say. \"No, no. But thanks for the cash all the same.\" \n\"Can you pass on this to your assistant.\" \n\"Sure. And if you have a bottle of tippex with a 733 in the serial number, Mike outside would like it.\" \nStriking while the iron is hot, I shoot straight back to where the PFY is, helping his beancounter make some internet banking transactions to secure his eBay purchases. \n\"Christmas bonus?\" the PFY asks. \n\"None this year, the bastards,\" I lie. \"Apparently they have to buy a new cheque safe...\" \n\"Ah,\" the PFY says guiltily. \n\"Still, not to worry. In any case, I thought I'd toddle off, last minute presents to buy and all that...\" \n\"Okay, have a good one,\" the PFY says. \nSo now I have to leave the building and calculate the chances of the PFY running into the Boss. Well, the PFY running into the Boss before I get out of the building... hen feed that into equation about how long it takes to get down three flights of stairs versus three flights in the superfast lifts... Hmmm… \nSomewhere between 1 and Ground the lift stops and the lights go out.. \n\"Dark in there isn't it?\" the PFY's clipped voice comes through the lift speaker. \"Do you want to play a game?\" \n... \nUh Oh. \n"}

The data included a patient-specific drug interaction conflict database as well as billing and payroll systems. \nWhen the code failed to launch in April 2004 because of coding flaws, Yung-Hsun (who survived a round of lay-offs) reprogrammed the malware to go off on April 23, 2005 - his next birthday.

I've got a shocking case of nominal amnesia which I can't shake and the PFY just isn't helping. True, being locked in a lift for several hours (until I'd fed sufficient pound notes through the doors to the PFY) just prior to the holidays didn't help, but I'm never really any good at getting back into the swing of things after time away from the workplace. It's as if the mind just spins down and needs a couple of days of doing something mildly taxing to get one's thoughts back up to speed again... \n\"What's happening?\" the PFY asks in response to the blank expression on my face as I survey the login prompt in front of me. \n\"Can't remember my password,\" I sigh, tapping away on desk impatiently. \n\" You can't remember your password?\" the Boss asks cheerfully after wandering in unannounced. \n\"No. In fact, when you've got around 40 10-12 character root passwords to remember you're lucky to remember any of them. Which is why I...\" \n\"Write them down?\" the Boss prompts. \n\"No I encrypt them and store them on my desktop.\" \n\"And you can't get into your desktop!\" he chortles happily. \n\"No - because I changed my password yesterday as it had expired. All I can really remember is that it's something that you get hit with?\" \n\"A car?\" the PFY says helpfully. \n\"NO, you get hit with it,\" I say. \"I know I'll remember it soon, but I just can't remember it now. I remember thinking that it was something that I'd never forget.\" \n\"Yet still you did,\" the Boss chuckles. \n\"What about hard drive?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"No, would be way too simple. Anyway, I remember that the password was long,\" I say, scanning my memory for further information. \n\"A Microsoft update via dialup? An Oracle streamlined install?\" \n\"No, No! This isn't helping! I'll have to think of something else. Though... I think it also had something to do with the Boss.\" \n\"Management?\" the Boss suggests. \"Responsibility? Team Player? uh...\" \n\"Git!\" the PFY chimes in. \"Tosser? ArseBandit? Trainspotter?\" \n\"!\" the Boss gasps, wordlessly. \n\"Oh, you mean this Boss?\" the PFY gasps, going for the late (and crap) save. \n\"It was something about... I don't know... the boss... being hit... and... um... electricity... Yes! Definitely something about electricity!\" \n\"Well that certainly narrows it down,\" the Boss says sarcastically. \"But think - how did you come by the password? Can you recreate the process you used?\" \n\"I'm not sure. I was thinking about a new password, and then I was also thinking about something to do with hitting, you, and then electricity - but I can't remember how they all came together.\" \n\"Torch,\" the Boss gasps. \"You can hit someone with a torch, it's electric and I own one!\" \n\"In that case we could use car as well\" the PFY says dryly. \"Or vibrator.\" \n\"Right!\" the Boss snaps decisively. \"I...\" \n\"Just jokes,\" I say calmly. \"We're all friends here. Now back to the password...\" \n\"What were you thinking about?\" the Boss repeats. \n\"Give me time,\" I say calmly. \"It'll come to me... I was looking around the office for inspiration...\" \n\"And you saw this,\" the PFY says, holding up a cattleprod. \n\"No...\" \n\"And you thought of me?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No ...The door blew open.\" \n\"Yes?\" the PFY coaxes. \n\"And it banged into the wall where that big dent is, which reminded me...\" \n\"...OF THE TIME I PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN, BUMPED THE BOSS INTO THE CATTLEPROD YOU WERE TESTING AND HE FELL BACK ONTO THE WALL!\" the PFY gasps happily. \n\"YES!\" I cry. \"And it was a pass phrase based around that!\" \n\"Accident?\" the Boss suggests. \n\"No... No, I can't get it.\" \n\"Try and recreate the sequence of events in your mind's eye,\" the Boss says, airyfairily. \"Does that help?\" \n\"Ummmmmm... Nope.\" \n\"Maybe it's tactile? What about if you hold the cattleprod in your hands?\" the PFY says. \n... \n\"No, nothing. It's too distracting having you both shout suggestions at me. I'm sure it'll come to me if I just have a few moments to myself to think...\" \n\"Ok, I'll go get a coffee - so you're not distracted...\" the PFY says. \n\"Okay,\" the boss says. \"And I'll be quiet.\"  \"Quiet as a mouse. I'll just stand over here out of the wa-\" \n>Click< >BUMP< >KZERT!< >CRASH!< \n\"That was it, H1l4r3us!\" I say, as I step over the Boss and tap away on my keyboard. \n\"You're welcome,\" the PFY says, helping the Boss extract himself from the wallboard. \n\"And I'm in!\" I gasp happily at the Boss. \"You know I think that whole recreation idea of yours was a winner.\" \n\"Now you can help me with my password,\" the PFY says. \"It was something to do with a spade, a sack of quick lime and a roll of carpet in the work van...\" \n"}

This is made worse when they appear to be the only expert in the country and are desperate to get someone else enthused so as to form a pressure group for the adoption of the application... \n. . . \nSo it is that the Boss has lined someone up to tell us all about how we're going to install an application which will link our websites, calendars, email, financials, HR, etc, etc to one clearly understandable homogenous mass with some new software that has just been released into the Open Source world. \nMoreover, the Boss is not at all impressed at our protestations about the robustness of the software development and release lifecycle of this project which, from the look of the webpage, consists of someone saying \"I've got a good idea!!!\" \nAnd so it is that a conference room is booked, audio visual gear is installed, biscuits purchased and a server machine configured to the exacting requirements of our expert. \nOf course the true horror is revealed when we discover that the required OS is such an obscure version of Linux that it probably only has one contributor (to match the Google result when we go looking for it). The install notes describe the branch as \"Linux's best-kept secret\" - and once the PFY and I finally work our way through the convoluted install process we agree to keep it that way. \nAnd of course no enthusiast is ever going to use the release version of any prerequisite software when there's a beta version that's been available for at least a day, so the PFY and I waste another couple of hours trying to nurse the install script to life under the new version. \nSeveral emails later we have the system up and running and let our expert know that he can come in an do his demo any time... \n...which is when the Boss tells us that he's sold the idea to senior management and that once the explanation and three-day tutorial is over we'll start running up the software in the company... \n\"Did he say three days?\" the PFY asks, gnawing on a knuckle. \"I thought you said it'd be half a day tops if we agreed with everything he said, didn't ask questions and erased the server as soon as he'd left the building.\" \n\"I admit I made a slight miscalculation on the amount of our time that might be made available to him, but I'm sure that as software experts with a history of successful open source installs in the past we can lock him in the basement until the whole idea blows over.\" \n\"Ah yes,\" the PFY says. \"In fact, I think that's where we installed the server.\" \n\"B2, over in the far corner room.\" \n\"The electrical plant room with the dodgy light and even dodgier bus-bar cover?\" the PFY asks. \n\"The very same.\" \n. . . One day later . . . \n\"Where the hell is he?\" the Boss asks. \"He was supposed to be here two hours ago! I bought biscuits.\" \n\"I shouldn't worry, I'm sure he'll be here eventually,\" the PFY says, just as the lights dim slightly. \n\"Then again, perhaps we should flag the whole thing?\" I add as the basement smoke alarm beacon illuminates on our building monitor. \n\"But what will I say to senior management?\" \n\"Just tell them you're doing an analysis of needs and that you'll need each of them to fill in a quick 20-page questionnaire... no one will ever mention it again.\" \n\"I... OK then. But I'm keeping the biscuits.\" \n\"What biscuits?\" \nSigh. \n"}

Better still when the IT consumables company replaces the grizzled veteran of \"over a million 8 inch floppies sold\" with Susan, a lovely young woman with a pleasant nature and the drinking habits of a CAMRA founding member... \nSo I'm ordering my second gross of cleaning tapes over a couple of quiet pints at the pub when the Boss trundles in with a sneaky expression on his face to interrupt my important work-related chatting up... \n\"Uhh... where's your offsider at the moment?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Who?\" I ask whilst giving the thumbs up to a third carton of cleaning tapes (which will probably be sufficient to see the company through to the next millennium). \n\"Your assistant.\" \n\"Oh him. He's probably still offsite doing those VPN client installs you asked for.\" \n\"How far's he got?\" \n\"No idea,\" I say. \"But at about 20 minutes a time plus half an hour travel he's probably almost done by now.\" \n\"So you don't know exactly?\" he asks - attempting to make some sort of point. \"What if you needed him to help you with something?\" \n\"I'd ring him on his mobile,\" I suggest. \n\"What if he's had an accident?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Then he's not going to be any help to me is he?\" \n\"The point I'm trying to make is he should have a GPS on him – or at least the company vehicle should.\" \n\"You mean a GPS tracker ,\" I say. \n\"They're... not the same thing?\" \n\"One is used to help you find where you are, the other’s used to find where something else - like a company car – is.\" \n\"Oh, well I suppose in that case we should just have GPS units then.\" \n\"But what if the PFY's had an accident?\" I ask. \n\"Like you say - he'd be no help,\" the Boss says, moving on. \"So when can you get a GPS unit - a portable one?\" \n\"We can do you one of those,\" Susan chips in, downing her pint of cider and flipping over a couple of pages. \"A couple of hundred quid'll get you this one which has an SD card slot and a downloadable range of nav voices - from Spock to Billy Graham.\" \n\"I'll take it!\" the Boss gasps. \"Simon’ll fix you up with a purchase order...\" \n. . . \n\"What was that about?\" the PFY asks, once the Boss has trundled off. \n\"No idea,\" I said. \"He set a speed record in changing from caring about your welfare to not giving a rat’s...\" \n\"It'll be Geocaching,\" Susan responds helpfully. \n\"Geocaching?\" \n\"Yeah, it was mentioned in one of those Management rags a couple of weeks back. It's all the rage as middle managers from all over the place are ordering top-of-the-line GPS units as IT gear. I've sold out of all the top line models already.\" \n\"But why’s the Boss spending my budget on toys?\" \n\"It's happening all over the place. The rag has their own geocaching page where employers can leave clues and coordinates for readers to pick up hints on job prospects – the theory being that if you’re good enough to solve the clues you might be a good prospect for employment.\" \n\"And this is popular?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Oh yeah!\" Susan responds. \"We lost one of our people to a company just down the road! They just gave the salary, the GPS coordinates and a simple substitution code clue!\" \n\"And he was gone?\" \n\"Yep. He found the place in his lunch hour and was gone.\" \n\"Curiouser and curiouser...\" the PFY says thoughtfully. \"You wouldn’t know the name of the website would you?\" \n. . . \nA few days later the Boss returns from lunch nursing a black eye, a bloody nose and a broken GPS, so we know the dream’s over... \n\"What happened?\" I ask feigning concern. \n\"I... tripped,\" he says. \"But I really need to organise a new GPS as the screen on this one’s broken and I have something I need to look up.\" \n\"Staring at the screen when you should have been watching where you were going?\" the PFY asks, pulling a replacement unit out of his drawer. \n\"Something like that,\" the Boss says, leaving the broken GPS and wandering off with its replacement. \n\"Great stuff this Geocaching,\" the PFY says, pulling yet another unit out of his drawer. \"You find the coordinates of some local night-shift working nutcase, post them - along with some clues that only the Boss could figure out – to the website then pay some kids to ring the nutcase’s doorbell every half hour or so for the next few days before running off... bloody fantastic!\" \nThat’s technology for you – we’re always finding new uses for it! \n"}

Obviously it will take longer for the whole company to convert to this but in the meantime we're planning to implement recycling, energy saving measures and implement the purchasing of carbon credits.\" \n\"Carbon credits!\" I sneer, unable to suppress the derision in my voice. \n\"What's wrong with carbon credits?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Carbon credits are like putting a humidifier in a room then putting a dehumidifier in as well to offset the effects,\" the PFY offers. \n\"Only with carbon credits they're in different rooms,\" I add. \"Or maybe it's a bit like putting your heater on in one room of the house and turning the aircon on at the other.\" \n\"I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.\" \n\"Okay,\" I say. \"Carbon credits are a bit like beating someone up on this side of the world and sponsoring one of those poor starving kids on the other side of the world to make up for the fact that you're a complete shit at home.\" \n\"Only people think you're great because you're cancelling out a bad deed with a good one.\" \n\"Instead of not committing the bad deed in the first place,\" I add. \n\"It's like dropping a crap in someone's desk drawer and offsetting it by cleani...\" the PFY starts. \n\"I think he gets the picture,\" I interrupt. \"So what energy saving initiatives are we looking at?\" \n\"Low power lighting, grey water harvesting and green computing, obviously.\" \n\"Green computing - you mean iMacs?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I think he means computing hardware which supports hibernation, processor cycle reduction and suspension and virtualisation,\" I mumble. \n\"Oh right, NancyBoy boxes.\" \n\"Exactly!\" \n\"I...\" the Boss burbles. \n\"So we'll end up with machines which'll slow themselves down at weird and inconvenient times and lose processing power while they ramp up in response to need?\" \n\"No, I'm sure the bloke said you can tune them to only reduce to a certain point and to speed up recovery time. And with virtualisation you can tune them to consolidate virtual servers onto the least number of machines and shut the rest down till they're needed.\" \n\"Still sounds like Nancy-Boy boxes,\" I concur. \n\"?\" \n\"A REAL computer has ONE speed and the only powersaving it permits is when you pull the power leads out of the back!\" I blurt. \"In fact, a REAL computer would have a hole in the front to push trees into and an exhaust pipe out the back for the black smoke to come out of.\" \n\"AND,\" the PFY adds. \"they run so hot - even on screensaver - that they keep the room nice and toasty when you're not there - saves on heating.\" \n\"All that is a thing of the past though.\" the boss burbles. \"The bloke was telling me that using mobile processor technology the...\" \n\"What bloke?\" I ask. \n\"The... um...\" \n\"Mmm?\" the PFY says. \n\"Bloke... from... uh...\" \n\"...\" \n\"...the... green consultancy...\" \n\"So you and the IT Director talk to some yoghurt-eating fruitcake in a hemp suit and sandals and the next thing we know you're planning to replace our high power server environment with a poor imitation of it?\" \n\"I think you'll find it's the way of the future,\" a voice from the doorway says. \n\"Ah, Simon, Steven,\" the Boss says. \"This is... uh... Jeremy from the Power Green consultancy. He's been contracted to the company for a couple of months to help us reduce our carbon footprint.\" \n\"Hi,\" Jeremy bubbles. \"Nice to meet you.\" \n\"And what is it you do Jeremy?\" \n\"Well, in a nutshell I analyse plant and power usage, server capacity utilisation and desktop usage and feed those numbers all into a sophisticated package which makes recommendations on what hardware to purchase in the short term to improve a company's ITCF.\" \n\"ITCF?\" \n\"IT Carbon footprint.\" \n\"Ah right, so what you're saying is you'll gather some numbers and dictate what server equipment we buy this year.\" \n\"Well... essentially, yes,\" Jeremy says. \n... Two hours later... \n\"OK,\" the PFY says as we leave the building via the service entrance. \"All we have to do to be nastiness neutral is to find a couple of people bound and gagged in a skip bin, take them out, give them a couple of wallets, unkick them a few times, unelectrocute them with a cattle prod and say 'clothing hippy on discount percent seventy look oh'.\" \n\"On the other side of the world,\" I add. \n\"Should we stop for a quick lager first?\" \n\"Be rude not to...\" \n"}

That flashing red lamp over there tells me of a degraded RAID array. And those two flickering orange lamps over there tell me a server has two dodgy power supplies that it's switching between. And all these stories are part of one larger story.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Hmm?\" \n\"What's the larger story?\" \n\" THE larger story.\" \n\"What's the larger story.\" \n\"You mean the name of the larger story?\" \n\"I... yes, if you like.\" \n\"The name of the larger story is... The Silence of the Servers.\" \n\"The Silence of the Servers?!\" \n\"Yes. It's an interesting story that I'm sure you'll like, involving a mid level manager, and electrical engineer and the deferment of the refurbishment of an UPS for financial reasons.\" \n\"I... don't know what you mean.\" \n\"You're sure?\" \n\"Positive...\" \n\"Ok, once upon a time there was a technical person - me, for instance - who put the replacement of UPS batteries and refurbishment of the electronics onto his business plan - as a cheaper option that replacing the UPS outright. And in this story lets say that this technical person's manager would rather spend the money on something else - new computers with touch screen monitors for a call-centre - for instance.\" \n\"Those machines were in last year's budget! We'd committed to buying them when we replaced the call centre software!\" \n\"As I say, this is just a story. So say, for instance the UPS wasn't refurbished and the batteries not replaced. Say the manager concerned didn't want to tell his technical person that this wasn't going to happen for financial reasons - for his own personal safety reasons. Say he got an electrical engineer to pretend to do some technical work and battery replacements but instead jumper the UPS input and output while taking off a small supply to power the lamps on the panel to look like it was still working normally...\" \n\"I... don't know what you're talking about.\" \n\"Of course you don't. Because this is just a story. But say when this electrical engineer crept back in the wee small hours to do the internal bypass and panel rewire he didn't realise that the moment he disconnected the UPS internals he'd also be disconnecting the power to the SNMP agent inside the UPS that talks to our paging system...\" \n\"Oh...\" the Boss. \n\"And say, instead of jumpering input and output through a smoothing circuit he just connected all our expensive servers to dirty raw mains - dirty raw mains fed from the same board as the lift motor as it happens, a huge inductive load, I might add, introducing power factor changes, surges, back EMF, etc...\" \n\"I...\" \n\"And say in the story that the technical person mentions to his manager that there could be a power problem. If the manager were innocent of wrongdoing he'd call the electrical engineer to check the UPS and if not he'd sneak back in the middle of the night to make sure that the lights on the UPS were still working properly so that noone would find out his dirty little financial secret.\" \n\"Uh...\" \n\"But anyway,\" I say, flicking the lights on. \"The backstory is irrelevant, it's how the story ends that's important.\" \n\"How it ends?\" \n\"Yes, say the story ends with a complete UPS replacement, then it's a happy ending. If it ends in lies and denial, well...\" \n\"You know I think we might have budget for a UPS replacement,\" the Boss burbles. \n\"Excellent, I'll let the PFY know,\" I say, reaching for the cellphone. \n\"Really? Where is he?\" \n\"He's in the basement carpark doing to your car what the engineer did to our UPS.\" \n\"I... but I thought you said it was a happy ending.\" \n\"Perhaps you should think of this more as a Roald Dahl happy ending then. Maybe that would help...\" \n"}

If your server reboots because a chunk of memory has crapped itself, he’ll be telling you how it’ll be a seating fault, how memory seating is an art unto itself and that he learnt how to seat memory properly from Michael Dell himself.” \n“At Michael's home, over a few beers,” I add. “Because that’s the other thing about Jim. Whatever you do, he’s done something better!” \n“Three times better,” the PFY chips in. “For instance, say you said you had an exciting drive into work this morning.” \n“Jim would say that was nothing,” I comment, “as he used to Rally drive.” \n“In ‘Nam,” the PFY adds. \n“For the V.C,” I offer. \n“In a car with a jet engine.” \n“Powered by a fuel he created from his own urine,” I finish. \n“So you’re suggesting...” the Boss asks \n“He’s a bullshit artist, yes,” the PFY concludes. “And one topic that he believes he qualifies for ‘world authority status’ on is computing.” \n“It can't be that bad,” the Boss says. “He'll just be a user with more experience than most.” \n“Less experience than most is probably more accurate,” I reply. “But that doesn’t stop him from professing his expertise to anyone who listens. But don’t take our word for it, bring up a topic, any topic at all. Religion, say!” \n“Because he met the Pope,” the PFY says. \n“And the Dali Lama.” \n“Sadly he missed out on meeting Mohammed, but he has read all the books and went on a spiritual quest to find the source of the prophet’s teachings.” \n“Before he was made a grand potato of the Kabbalah.” \n“And he’s not one to let complete ignorance of a topic stop him from having an opinion.” \n\"Oh...\" the Boss says worriedly. \n\"What?\" \n\"Well, I thought you might appreciate the input... I invited him up.\" \n\"PREMO!\" the PFY snaps dryly. \nMoments later Jim arrives and proceeds to tell us how the viewing window in our door is a security risk. \n\"It's bullet-proof glass an inch thick!\" the PFY lies. \n\"I know, but it's still a security risk. Because of ricochets,\" Jim snaps back. \n\"Good point,\" the boss blathers, picking up a pen and paper and making a note. \n\"Anything else?\" the PFY asks. \n\"The door to your computer room has wire-strengthened glass.\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"It's not bullet-proof though,\" Jim says smugly. \n\"Yes - we wanted to avoid the ricochet risk,\" the PFY chirps sarcastically. \"Anything more?\" \n\"Is that an open riser?\" he asks, pointing through the viewing window on the computer room door. \n\"Indeed,\" the PFY says, leading us into the computer room and to the riser door. \"But as you can see, it's behind two secure doors and has this >clank< steel bar to stop people entering, this steel tray >bonga< >bonga< to stop people falling if they do enter and this video camera...\" \n\"To let you know if someone enters the riser,\" Jim finishes. \n\"No, that's just so we can send something into those 'most hilarious deaths' TV shows.

Not because of the evil machinations of the managing classes, nor the heat seeking stupidity of our users, nor even the Machiavellian plans of our suppliers... \nNo, today is going to be bad because the PFY has had insomnia for the past week or so. His game playing marathons have upset his body clock so badly that it has no idea of what time it is anywhere. \nOrdinarily, your average garden variety geek - like me, or possibly you for that matter - would cure a bout of insomnia with the hard reset of several more days of non stop game playing and vast amounts of lager. When done properly this leads to a coma-like 12 hour sleep marathon sprawled over the keyboard dribbling. When done improperly it's much the same thing except it's on a Circle Line tube carriage for half of London to see... \nSadly, however, in this case the PFY decided to fight fire with fire and deprive himself of ANY sleep to teach his body a damn good lesson. \n...which has lead to the paranoia and the PFY's most recent assertion - that the Boss is planning to replace us with robots. This in turn has lead to the PFY tailing the Boss around the building \n\"Exiting at level three,\" the PFY says quietly into his phone. \"Going into... the library!\" \nDamn it! Now I know I'm going to have to go up and take a look - what with the PFY's unnatural fear of librarians and all (which I won't go into in any detail - for your own sanity). Normally the PFY'd shrug this fear off. However, in his current state of mind there's no telling what'll happen if I don't intervene. \nIt wouldn't be so bad if our library actually HAD a librarian instead of just a large room full of books that noone goes into. Sigh. \nResigned to my fate, I trudge upstairs to meet the PFY. \n\"He went in there,\" the PFY whispers, pointing. \n\"Into the library...\" \n\"Ssh!\" the PFY says. \"They might hear you!\" \n\"Who might?\" \n\"The librarians.\" \n\"We don't HAVE librarians.\" \n\"Yes, but one might have got the daylight savings hours wrong and be using our library as a safe harbour till night-time!\" \n\"Yeah,\" I say, rolling my eyes, knowing what's coming. \n\"I'm telling you, they're vampires!\" \n\"Of course they are,\" I sigh, bracing myself for the inevitable diatribe. \n\"LOOK! The pasty white skin - they never go out in the sun! The heavily diffused lighting which gives them a reason for not having a shadow. There's NEVER a mirror in a library... AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SEE IT?\" \n\"Quite possibly,\" I say, realising that the only way through this exercise is to push the PFY through his retinue of proofs till we're out the other side. \"But they're hardly offensive are they - they're very quiet.\" \n\"YES! QUIET!\" he gasps. \"They always seem to be able to creep up behind you, yet you turn around and they're gone. And they love the high ceilings!\" \n\"You mean like the ceilings you get in most big libraries?\" \n\"YES! And pipe work - have you ever noticed the pipework they always have on those high ceilings.\" \n\"The sprinkler pipes,\" I sigh. \"The ones you'd expect to see in a room full of... paper.\" \n\"Oh that's just what they WANT you to think. But at night - they hang from them!\" \n\"Yes, good point. Tell me, did you happen to knock back a couple of flagons of cider on the way to work this morning?\" \n\"What? I... - it's made of apples, it's good for you!\" \nSo the situation is worse than I thought – but I must forge on. \n\"So tell me,\" I say, preparing for the final assault. \"Surely if they were vampires they'd be found out? Wouldn't their husbands or wives notice?\" \n\"Ah-HAH!\" the PFY snaps. \"You'd THINK that wouldn't you - but they're only allowed to nest with their own kind!\" \n\"So librarians can only marry other librarians?\" \n\"Pretty much,\" the PFY nods sagely. \"Have you ever met a librarian that wasn't married to another librarian - or someone who behaves like a librarian.\" \n\"Yes,\" I nod. \"And their children?\" \n\"Their spawn you mean,\" the PFY gasps. \"The undead. SP-900 sunblock - but it doesn't fool anyone.\" \n\"I beg to differ,\" I say, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. \"Surely the same thing could be said about a lot of IT people - pasty white skin, live inside mostly, don't use mirrors. We have pipework in the Computer room too...\" \n\"I...\" \n\"And a lot of geeks pair up with other geeks...\" I say gently. \n\"Ah... I... Really?\" \n\"Really.\" I say, as the Boss emerges from the library, book in hand. \n\"So there's nothing to be worried about?\" \n\"Nothing at all,\" I say. \n\"And him?\" the PFY asks as the Boss walks by, attempting in vain to hide the title of the book he's carrying. \" A case study in automation of computing infrastructure.\" \n\"Oh he's a vampire,\" I say, handing the PFY a broom handle. \nWho am I to stand in the way of God's work? \n"}

Three days later in a room that doesn’t officially exist . . . \n“Well, it’s the real thing,” says a white-coated bloke carrying a CD Caddy with a large lock on it. “The full SCO install media with all the maintenance packs probably has a street value of... next to nothing.” \n“So it’s the latest version then?” I say. \n“Oh yes. What I can’t understand is how he managed to get his hands on it - I mean in this country we have very strict import legislation which is supposed to cover indecent, objectionable and just plain crap material.” \n“Careful – you’ll affect the Spice Girls comeback with talk like that!” I caution. “Has my assistant come round yet?” \n“Oh yes, he’s up and about,” labcoat says, pressing a button which turns the wall into a viewing window of the PFY wandering blearily around a white room. “We initially had him under sedation, but once we realised he’d actually booted off the media we thought it prudent to induce an artificial coma for a couple of days.” \n“You made him read the Richard Stallman story?” \n“Yeah – though he only got as far as the foreword.” \n“Really?” I say “I can only remember the dedication.” \n“I know - most people do. They say the typesetter was on adrenalin and speed for his own safety. After the first three deaths leastways.” \n“So he’s free to go?” I say, pointing at the PFY. \n“Sure,” labcoat says, pressing a button to open the back door in the PFY’s room which now exits onto a Soho side street. “He’ll find his own way home but will have no memory of the last few days - he'll think he’s been out on a vendor-bender.” \n“And what do I tell his girlfriend?” \n“Just tell her you think he caught a 72-hour virus,” labcoat says. “And that he needs to be kept on a diet of meat, veg and Blackadder reruns.” \n“And he’ll be ok?” \n“Hopefully. Most people make a full recovery though some have relapses – he’s certainly not the worst we’ve seen. We had one guy in here who’d accidentally bought the full OS2 Warp install media on eBay thinking it was a Star Trek movie. Now he was hard work because it was both crap and ancient. We made him read Stallman four times before he was able to be released.” \n“Ah, D...” another labcoat says walking in. “Speaking of that Warp install media, you haven’t seen it have you?” \n“No, why, when did you last have it?” \n“Uh... Not sure. I know I had it in my pocket when we brought that last guy around...” \n. . . \nI could go on about Tranquiliser guns in Soho but the D-Notices are fairly specific... \n"}

Only all happening in what seemed like a fraction of a second.\" \nDamn, he’s good ! Unfortunately... \n\"The cleaner’s cupboard you say?\" I ask, giving the Boss a chance to revise his story. \n\"That’s what it sounded like.\" \n\"Are you sure?\" I ask. \"I mean you’re... positive?\" \n\"Yes!\"  \"Oh, well, in that case I suppose I’ll go and take quick look.

The Boss might even be interested in hearing about things like the compression of time that makes a four-hour gaming session seem like 10 minutes, the gravitation-like pull of minesweeper which can draw a person in from acro… or did I forget to mention that? \n>EeeSLAMslameeslamSLAMsqueak< \nOoops. \n"}

They're just lightweight access doors designed to be used as a first line of defence – to be backed up by security personnel.\" \n\"I see.\" \n\"I mean were these doors even purchased with server room access in mind?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"So you admit they weren't? You put your hand up for something that was going free, didn't you?\" \n\"They weren't exactly free - we had to pay security the purchase price when it was decided that they shouldn't go on the front of the building.\" \n\"Why.\" \n\"Uhhhmmmm, I think Security had some concerns about the door's... robustness.\" \n\"I rest my case!\" \n\"Perhaps you could put them somewhere more useful – like controlling entry to the cafeteria?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Why?\" \n\"I dunno, prevent people coming back for seconds, stopping outsiders like our engineers snaffling all the onion Bhajis – maybe controlling access to the bar?\" \n\"Actually,\" the Boss says, thinking about it a bit. \"That might actually be a good idea! I'll put it to the catering staff.\" \n...Moments later when the Boss has departed... \n\"You've been rather quiet on all this?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"Yes,\" he responds. \"I've been reading through the installation guide. Micro thin door glass and TV-dinner-grade aluminium extrusions aside these doors are pretty good!\" \n\"In what way?\" \n\"They have an inbuilt processor which isn't too shabby, a face processing offload engine which uses 18 facial regions for recognition from up to 60 degrees from head on and they even have expression templates.\" \n\"Expression templates?\" \n\"Yeah, you can let the doors make decisions on both on whether the face is known or unknown and what sort of mood they're in.\" \n\"So you could block someone who has access if they look irate?\" I say, starting to like this idea a bit. \n\"Oh that's just the tip of the iceberg! You can create door profiles with operational settings for a particular person in a particular mood.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Oh yes,\" the PFY blathers. \"Any one of the configuration settings can be matched to a profile - opening\/closing speed, opening\/closing distance, opening\/closing force, open time, door-held behaviour, multiple person acceptance. Say the Boss has just had a crap day - you can make the door open at light speed when he's x metres from the door, slam again at light speed when he's y metres from the door, not open if his wife's with him, you name it, it can be done. AND there's hierarchies so that if the door's not opening for the Boss and his wife it WILL open for the CEO - and slam shut if the Boss and his wife try and sneak in behind him!\" \n\"So... in the interests of... uh... cafeteria security... we should investigate the full gamut of door control options.\" \n\"As an aid to the... analysis of the... facial recognition door controller... genre,\" the PFY finishes. \n\"OK then, lets do it!\" \n...Three days later... \n\"Have you, uh, got a moment to speak with security about the sliding doors you had installed in the cafeteria?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Sure, what do they want to know?\" \n\"Oh, not a lot, they just want to hear from you about your experiences with the programming of the access control program thing.\" \n\"What do they want to know precisely?\" the PFY asks helpfully. \n\"Uuhhhm, just how it works. How to use it.\" \n\"So they're thinking of getting some of them for the building then?\" \n\"Not exactly,\" the Boss responds. \n\"?\" \n\"They've decided that they do want to remove the doors from the cafeteria - but at least they've reimbursed us for the purchase price.\" \n\"Don't tell me, they're not happy with the way they've been programmed?\" \n\"It's not that exactly - although I have heard through the grapevine that they weren't impressed with the daily sweepstake on who'd get a cup of scalding hot coffee down their front when the doors slammed closed as they were about to exit.\" \n\"Just a glitch in the facial recognition software,\" the PFY comments. \n\"The same glitch that slammed the door repeatedly on the Head Accountant's laptop just before he was due to give his presentation on right-sizing the company?\" \n\"Quite probably,\" the PFY says. \"Tricky business, debugging facial recognition code - it's all in assembler for speed you know.

But there's always an Underground person watching on the cameras.\" \n\"So it's all a conspiracy run by the Underground.\" \n\"Yep,\" the PFY says, rifling through his drawers and pulling out a set of door keys. \n\"So why don't you ring the number on the machine and get your money back?\" \n\"A. They never give your money back, and B. The moment is gone – I needed crisps and they robbed me of that.\" \n\"Did you give the machine a little shake?\" the Boss asks helpfully. \"Bang it a couple of times?\" \n\"No, that money''s gone,\" the PFY sulks. \"The only thing I can get now is revenge...\" \nUh-oh... \n\"...I'll be in the lab.\" \n. . . \n\"What lab?\" the Boss asks once the PFY's stormed downstairs. \"We don't have a lab.\" \n\"No,\" I agree. \"We don't.

You go down, I'll wait here.\" \n\"I... think I'll just see if he calms down a bit,\" the Boss says, smelling the fear in my tone. \nThree hours later the PFY's back, wheeling an all-too-familiar chunk of large luggage. \n\"Is it in there?\" the Boss asks, not knowing whether to expect an atomic bomb or a chemical weapon. \n\"It is,\" the PFY says ominously. \n\"So you're using my pinch then?\" I enquire. \n\"It's not a pinch and it's not yours,\" the PFY snaps back. \n\"I made it.\" \n\"You made part of it,\" the PFY responds. \n\"Now, now,\" the Boss says, trying to defuse the situation. \"I'm sure you can both claim credit for it – whatever it is.\" \n\"A pinch,\" I say. \n\"Not a pinch,\" the PFY argues. \n\"Okay, so it's just a ginormous momentary effect electromagnet.\" \n\"That's what it was – but I've modified it.\" \n\"How?\" I asked, interested. \n\"Since you originally made this we've scrapped two UPS units – so I paralleled up the capacitors from them with the existing ones in your device.

However, were there a history of... power anomalies... in London, people would be far less suspicious.\" \n\"What are you suggesting?\" \n\"I'm suggesting that we go and visit one or two of our hardware vendors, then maybe the electronics shop that refused to repair my amplifier under warranty, the bank on the high street that wouldn't extend my overdraft, the...\" \n\"...RESTAURANT THAT CUT UP MY CREDIT CARD LAST YEAR!\" the Boss adds. \n\"Only if we can stop off at the beancounters before we leave,\" the PFY agrees. \n\"Course we can!\" \nWell, it's God's work, isn't it? \n"}

We need to take a look at how bad it is before we start getting upset. And bear in mind that they're bound to find out one of the lifts isn't working in a day or two...\" \nOne of the hazards of trying out experimental technology is the inevitable risk that it will somehow backfire on you, and in this case we have a doozy. After a whirlwind tour of the beancounters' floor, a number of underground vending machines, the kebab guy with the radio that's always a bit off-channel and finally the location of a congestion camera via the open deck of a tourist bus, the Boss, PFY and I have set off back for the comfort of mission control safe in the knowledge of a job well done. The only mistake we made in the process was charging the PFY's makeshift pinch up again in case we'd need its services on the way. \n\"What about the security camera?\" the Boss says, pointing at the lift ceiling. \n\"Good point,\" the PFY says. \"It may have missed the full force of the pinch.\" \n\"So we could maybe write a note?\" the Boss suggests. \n. . . \n\"Nothing,\" the PFY says half an hour later. \"I think it's fair to assume that Security has not seen our messages.\" \n\"So the camera's broken too then?\" the Boss asks. \n\"It would seem so,\" I concur. \n\"And the alarm button doesn't work?\" \n\"If the panel's dead it's all dead.\" \n\"MY CELLPHONE!\" \n\"You mean you took yours with you!\" the PFY gasps. \"After about 30 discharges of this baby I'm surprised the battery didn't explode!\" \nThe boss checks his phone only to find it completely dead. \n\"So surely security will come to investigate?\" \n\"Yeah, I don't think you really understand how security guards work,\" the PFY says carefully. \"Say they've got 20 images to keep an eye on and one of them suddenly goes blank. That's like giving them the morning off. They're not likely to fix that problem as doing so will cut into their cartoon time.\" \n\"Or their 'reading The Sun at childishly slow rate' time,\" the PFY adds. \n\"So they're not going to come?\" \n\"Not before we're drinking each other's sock-filtered urine, no,\" I feel obliged to reply. \"So how do we get out then?\" \n\"Hmm?\" the PFY says. \n\"Well you two have apparently been trapped in more lifts than anyone in the building. You must have escaped somehow.\" \n\"Ah yes, you mean like they do in the movies?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"OK, well you know how movies aren't real?\" \n\"?\" \n\"And that 99.99 per cent of lifts have their roof access hatch locked from the outside to prevent people from damaging the lift - or themselves.\" \n\"I didn't know that,\" the Boss sighs. \n\"No, and I'm betting you also didn't know that OUR access hatches are spot welded shut in any case?\" \n\"Why would someone do that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I don't know,\" I say, looking pointedly at the PFY. \"Why WOULD someone do that?\" \n\"YOU did it!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It was a long time ago,\" the PFY says. \"I hadn't thought to change it.\" \n\"So we're REALLY stuck here?\" \n\"Possibly – and possibly not. Givvus a hand muscling this door open will you?\" \nThe PFY, Boss and I pry the door open to reveal the slab wall of the lift shaft. \n\"Bugger,\" the PFY says. \"We might have been able to lever open an outside door and exit that way.\" \n\"So...\" \n\"So socks off and watertight containers out!\" the PFY replies, trying to add a bit of levity to the situation... \n\"You can't be serious!\" \n...Four hours later... \n\"Where are they?\" the Boss moans. \n\"Oh it's early days yet!\" the PFY says, getting a comfortable position on the floor. \n...Two hours later... \n\"Are there any pipes we could maybe tap on?\" the Boss asks, before going silent under a barrage of withering looks. \n\"The fire alarm,\" the PFY says, pointing at the detector above us. \n\"Electronic,\" I say. \"If only we still used the old mechanical ones. Still, can't hurt to give it a bash!\" >CRUNCH< \nLess than half an hour later we hear some thumping from above and the clatter of the hatch - which doesn't open, of course. Luckily however, our rescuer tells us he's going to flip the lift over to master then trip the return-to-ground signal – whatever the hell that means. \n\"Oh thank goodness!\" the Boss gasps, mopping away at his brow furiously. \nA minute or so later we're safely on the ground floor and a couple of minutes later our rescuer from the fire safety contractors has made his way back to us. \n\"The hatch is welded shut!\" he says. \"I've noted it on my report along with the faulty fire sensor.\" \n\"I have to say, I'm impressed with the speed of your response,\" I say. \n\"What do you mean?\" the fire bloke says, acting a bit defensive. \n\"Half an hour – unheard of!\" \n\"Half an hour?\" he replies. \"I got the sensor failure call just under seven hours ago, was onsite about four hours ago - but the blokes from security wouldn't let me sort it out at the time.\" \n\"Why not?\" the PFY asks. \n\"They said something about operational security but in reality I think they just had a bet running on what would happen in the lift. I've been here before, you see.\" \n\"RIGHT!\" the PFY says, plugging his luggage into the nearest power socket. \n\"You didn't happen to leave anything of any value at the security desk did you?\" \n\"Just my laptop.\" \n\"You might want to just go and grab that. Quickly!\" I say, as the PFY sets out for security with a determined expression on his face... \n"}

On Monday morning.\" \n\"So we're not really getting much for Gold support then are we?\" \n\"No, you're right, Platinum is the best option\" the PFY responds. \"With Gold support we can probably help you with phone numbers, but Platinum support would get you my cellphone number and my firsthand knowledge of the way the coffee was made and what potential problems might arise - determined from our extensive logs of previous coffee drinkers. We also have an in depth knowledge of the various mocha ingredients - which may have contained traces of nut, I'm not sure.\" \n\"Neither of us has a nut allergy,\" #2 blurts. \n\"And we welcome coffee clients with a proactive attitude to their own maintenance programs! As I've said, neither the Gold nor Platinum support models are compulsory by any means - because we like to be fair to all our coffee clients, big and small, and try to tailor our coffee support model to truly reflect the use the coffee's being put to, the number of cups the user has a day, the size of the cup and the individual blend choices which each client may desire.\" \n\"So what if we choose not to buy your coffee in the first place?\" \n\"As you've already had about a third of the coffee you've pretty much already committed to the coffee experience - what with the restocking fee of £50 and all - and to be brutally frank the cups you're drinking from were washed in a porcelain device not normally associated with food hygiene so I doubt that finishing the cup would have much difference at this stage. I would, however, stress that we would strongly recommend your upgrade to the Platinum support model so that we can aid in the 'debugging' exercise should you become violently ill in say... six or seven hours time...\" \n\"You...\" \n\"I know what you're going to say - you like the cut of our licensing gib?\" \n\"No,\" #1 responds. \"I was just wondering what your manager will think about this extortion?\" \n\"Not a lot I shouldn't think\" , I respond. \"Given that the muffins he had at the beginning of your presentation was made in a certain porcelain mixing bowl.\" \n\"I had one of those muffins!\" #2 gasps. \n\"Then I would suggest an immediate upgrade to Platinum support line subscription, uptake of our return-to-hospital user support and the additional no-questions-asked trouser replacement option.\" \n\"How much?\" #2 gasps, feeling the burn and half doubling over. \n\"Call it an even hundred,\" the PFY says, grabbing the proffered wallet while it's still touchable. \"Or one fifty for a two client pack...\" he adds as #1 starts greening up a bit... \n"}

So... you'd be... my assistant's… older sister?\" \n\"Mother,\" she responds, not indulging the obvious lie too much. \n\"Pleased to meet you,\" I say, offering my hand in welcome – much to the PFY's discomfort. \"Here, have a seat – would you like a nice cup of tea?\" \n\"Yes, that would be nice,\" she replies, easing herself into the PFY's chair. \"Milk, one sugar please dear.\" \n\"And an espresso for me, thanks,\" I add, opting for a drink best suited for saliva detection. \nA few minutes later the PFY's back with our drinks while I'm stepping the PFY's mum through a tour of the PFY’s desktop icons. \n\"And this file here is a movie about a young woman called Amber who, because of the foibles of the 80s job market, is unable to pay her many bills and has to devise alternative methods to do so.\" \n\"Like raffles?\" \n\"Yes, like raffles, cake stalls and suchlike,\" I say, giving the PFY a couple of moments as the colour returns to his cheeks. \n\"I’ve never heard of it,\" his mum replies. \n\"No, it was a bit of an... arthouse movie, with a cult following.\" \n\"Like Rocky Horror?\" \n\"Not so much.\" \n\"Your tea,\" the PFY interrupts, before I can continue, passing the cup over while \"accidentally\" standing on the power cord to his monitor. \nI grab my coffee and examine it closely for foreign bodies, sniff it for the presence of undiluted industrial cleanser and take a small precautionary sip. Lovely. As I'm taking a larger sip it occurs to me that the PFY's demeanour is that of a completely changed man. Gone is the ruthless technical professional with a penchant for petty larceny and mindless violence and in its place is a... a... nice person?! \nCould it be that the PFY's mum is some form of.. PFY Kryptonite? \n?! \nBut then I realise that if this were truly the case and the PFY was some form of alternative IT superman, struck down by his proximity to his weakening agent, then surely at this juncture he would encounter his arch-enem... \n\"Who sent this?!\" the Head Beancounter says, storming into Mission Control waving a piece of paper about angrily. \n\"What's that?\" the PFY asks, oozing helpfulness like one of those nice people you see on bank commercials \n\"One of you sent me this reply to my request for administrative control of the financials server!\" \n\"Really? Do you mind if I have a look at that?\" the PFY asks, taking the page \"Hmmm.

And then we bought our own Burroughs and did the whole thing ourselves, start to finish. We even got our own cards produced for the data entry and replaced our punch card system with mark sense cards – which was a process in itself, but I'll save that story for another day!\" \n\"Oh, don't feel obliged,\" the PFY says, stifling a whimper. \n...Which you can't blame him for. It seems that the Boss has the Grandpa Simpson gene which causes him to recount endless stories with no apparent relevance to what's happening at the moment and which are more stream of unconsciousness recollections than monologues of any value. And today, now that half the IT department is on user-centric service training, the Boss is all ours and has taken use under his wing in an effort to teach us to be more... well, boring. \n\"Nonsense!\" the Boss gasps. It's my pleasure. You know once we had this machine which had a symmetrical four prong plug in the back of it with a little arrow on it and it turned out that when the arrow was pointing in a vertical direction the machine ran at about two thirds of the speed of what it did when the arrow pointed in the horizontal direction – only no one knew this of course. Anyway, we'd paid for a machine that ran as fast as the vertical position only one day one of the vendor's engineers came and moved the plug from the vertical to the horizontal position for the testing (because they had to test the machine at it's full speed) and forgot to turn it back when he'd finished. Instant upgrade!!! It was only a couple of years later when we had something go wrong that another engineer discovered the plug was in the wrong orientation from what we'd paid for and said we'd have to pay for the upgraded ability that we'd been using. Well, that caused a stir, let me tell you!' \n\"I'm sure it did,\" the PFY says, picking up a pager from his desk and pressing the test button. \n>BEEP< >BEEP< \n\"Oh!\" the PFY continues. \"Looks like we've got a server down – I'll have to pop off to sort that out.\" \n\"That's ok,\" the Boss says. \"I'll come with you – I haven't told you about the time we were using one of those old acoustic couplers for remote diagnostics and our throughput from 300 baud to around 20! We searched for that problem for weeks before realising that when we shut the lid on the receiver it was squashing the foam in just the right way to generate a bit of feedback through a channel in the coupler's casing – which of course we didn't know because when the cover was closed you couldn't hear a thing.\" \n\"DO TELL!\" the PFY snaps, walking into the computer room to fake a server outage with the Boss in tow. \nMinutes later I notice an icon turn red on the monitor as the PFY probably presses its power button to ‘clear the fault' for the Boss' benefit, with a restart shortly thereafter. \n\"...and so it turned out that the punch cards had been eaten by weevils,\" the Boss blathers. \"Which explained all the parity errors we were getting!\" \n\"I see,\" the PFY says before making excuses about the calls of nature. \n\"I was just telling him about having to reread all our old punch cards,\" the Boss says, wandering over to my desk. \n\"Oh yeah, when you were getting data errors and found that insects had eaten holes through them,\" I say. \"I remember you telling me that!\" \n\"Weevils,\" the Boss says. \"But before that we had...\" \n\"An acoustic coupler with feedback, yes, I heard that. And the one about the plug which set the speed on your machine.\" \n\"Oh,\" the Boss says in a hurt tone as the PFY returns. \"But I know you've not heard about the time...\" \n\"One of your large disk drives head crashed and the whole floor shook?\" \n\"Oh,\" the Boss sniffs. \"What about the time...\" \n\"You bypassed the door-open switch on your 9 track tape drive and it lost vacuum and tape spewed out all over the floor?\" \n\"Oh,\" he repeats, sounding even more wounded before slowly wandering off. \n\"That was a bit cruel wasn't it?\" the PFY asks. \"And how did you know about that disk drive thing – I don't remember that story?\" \n\"EVERY old computer buff has a head crash story,\" I said. \"Anyway, I thought you'd done a runner when you ducked off to the bog.\" \n\"Nah,\" the PFY says holding up the home modified cattle prod wrapped in swathes insulation tape. \"I was just changing the batteries on this. Honestly, if I had to hear one more story about how they debugged 11\/34 crashes I was going to let him have it!\" \n\"And a good thing too. The 11\/34 was a piece of crap. The 11\/70 was a sack of cack as well and their only redeeming feature was they were the forerunner to the VAX series.

AND you'll get all new plant and state-of-the-art environmental monitoring and fire suppression.\" \n\"Really?\" I say, suppressing my natural urge to blurt PANTS ON FIRE! \"Who's moving out?\" \n\"We all are!\" he gasps cheerfully. \n\"All of us?\" \n\"The entire building!\" \n\"Why?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Well it's an interesting thing. An audit at the end of last year found that the only thing the company carried sufficient insurance for was workplace accident and associated liability. For some reason. Most importantly the building insurance was flagged as being seriously underestimated given the appreciation in value since the building was purchased - because of its proximity to certain parts of the city which are more desirable than they once were.\" \n\"Uh huh,\" the PFY says doubtfully. \n\"So what you're saying is that the building that was a bit of a fire sale special a number of years ago is now a valuable chunk of London real estate?\" \n\"Exactly! As a result of this the company decided to capitalise on its good fortune by selling up, buying elsewhere for vastly less and...\" \n\"Misreporting the capital gains as revenue?\" I ask. \n\"No, by buying elsewhere for less and using a portion of the profit to refurbish the new building into a Head Office. And it just so happens they've found an ex-government building not too far away from here which is an absolute bargain and about twice the size!\" \n\"Right,\" I say dubiously, waiting for the 'but..'. \"Got an existing computer facility then?\" \n\"No, one will be purpose built onsite - using all-new plant and materials.\" \n\"Cabling infrastructure?\" \n\"All new cabling to be installed top to bottom to your specifications.\" \n\"Sounds okay so far,\" I say slowly - having learnt from harsh experience that when encountering a goldmine one must prepare oneself for the shaft. \"When's it going to happen?\" \n\"Three weeks,\" he gasps excitedly. \nAnd there it is, complete with pit props and canary... \n\"You can't do a build like that within three weeks!\" I cry. \"It'll take months just to plan for it!\" \n\"Oh, they're not planning the build for three weeks time,\" the Boss blurts. \"We just have to be out of the building by then.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"...because we've sold it. Obviously some interim measures will need to be taken and some less than optimal configurations might need to be borne for the short term...\" \n\"Who the hell sells a building in three weeks?\" the PFY gasps, as in my mind I recall the server rooms of my youth and suppress a scream. \n... Rows of tables in carpeted rooms with servers stacked on and around them.... \n...Portable aircon units leaking water onto the floor... \n...IPS power!!!... \n...Rats' nests of network cabling and power cables strewn all over floors and tables, in doorways, across light fittings... \n\"It's not going to happen!\" I snap decisively. \n\"Has to happen - the building's been sold!\" the Boss responds. \n\"It may have been sold, but we can't possibly move the equipment in time. We need a temperature and humidity controlled environment, with UPS power, generator backup, security!\" \n\"Not to mention up-to-date racks, raised floor and a structured cabling system,\" the PFY says. \n\"How long would it take?\" \n\"Well, if we could get the people, 24-7, and the plant and hardware, I'm guessing... a couple of months.\" \n\"A COUPLE OF MONTHS!\" \n\"If they were working 24-7.\" \n\"We don't have a couple of months. You're just going to have to make do. I think I can get you allocated about half a floor where you could put all the servers and stuff - till the work's complete in the other half.\" \n\"With workers moving in and out of the gear, carrying building supplies?\" \n\"There might be a bit of building activity which might overlap...\" \n\"How about this - you sell the building and LEASE BACK the computer room and operations room until such time as the server room is built?\" \n\"I'm not really sure that makes financial sense – besides I've already told our risk people that we'd be okay to move. I mean, it's only some servers...\" \n\"You'll have to get the buyer to delay the purchase then,\" the PFY seethes. \n\"Never going to happen. They're moving their computer room as well and they've cancelled their lease. I can't think of anything that'd make them want to delay.\" \n\"Really?\" the PFY says. \n\"Nothing.\" \n. . . One day later . . . \n\"And apparently the WALLS of the computer suite may be made of asbestos,\" the PFY explains to the IT Director. \"Presumably because of its fire retardant properties. One of their technical people discovered it yesterday afternoon when they came to take some measurements and moved a panel.\" \n\"Are they sure it was asbestos?\" \n\"Oh yeah, it had CAUTION, ASBESTOS stencilled across it.\" \n\"And do we know how long it's been in the building?\" \n\"No, Could be 20 years, could be 20 minutes – But obviously now they're delaying the purchase for a couple of months until they can have the entire building checked to know what the removal costs would be...\" \n\"Awfully convenient for you, don't you think?\" \n\"What, the daily exposure to an environment that might kill me horribly in 20 years?\" the PFY replies. \"That's not what my solicitor thinks. He is thinking out-of-court settlement though.\" \n\"I think we'll wait for the outcome of the builder's report,\" the Director responds. \n\"No skin off my nose,\" the PFY says. \"It's all billable research time for my counsel, time for further discovery, examination of documents to see if anyone in the company has a history of signing off building works with substandard materials.\" \n\"I see. Well perhaps an out-of-court no-admission-of-guilt deal might be best,\" the Head mumbles. \n\"Meantime, I guess we'd better plan this new computer room properly,\" I add, nudging a stencil into the darkness under my desk... \n"}

Like talking to the company's shrink about whether the PFY should be referred to the authorities or not... \n\"Okay, so my name is Catherine, I'm just gathering some background on what occurred a couple of days ago and would like to ask you some questions about Stephen's behaviour leading up to the... incident.\" \n\"Sure,\" I say, taking a seat. \n\"Would you say that your assistant is liable to... uhhhm... flights of fantasy?\" \n\"Only in certain situations,\" I say. \n\"Such as?\" \n\"The Swedish volleyball team are visiting a jelly factory just as a fire breaks out, and the sprinklers come on and one of the jelly crystal tanks bursts, just as one of the team members makes an unkind remark about one of the other members hair styles,\" I reply. \"But apart from that...\" \n\"No paranoia, delusions?\" she asks, scribbling something down on a separate sheet of paper and writing my name at the top... \n\"Paranoia, delusions? No, not really,\" I say, suppressing more evidence than Lord Hutton, knowing it probably wouldn't help to mention the PFY's conspiracy theories about moon landings, vapour trails, petrol prices, UFOs, train spotters, global warming, ECHELON, mind control and scoutmasters (to name but a few) - even if most of them are true. \n\"Can you give me some background on the new Director of IT then?\" \n\"What would you like to know?\" \n\"As I understand it the former Director resigned after the company was forced to pay a large amount of compensation over an unexpected delay in relocating to a new building?\" \n\"Yes, we found asbestos in one of our rooms - and I'm sure that the stress of realising that you'd been exposed to potentially lethal airborne material for such a long time possibly had something to do with my assistant's actions.\" \n\"The asbestos later found to be mislabelled plasterboard?\" she asks. \n\"Yes, but the PFY wasn't to know that at the time.\" \n\"I see.

R2D2, Yoda, and 'the Bollard'.\" \n\"Harmless fun!\" \n\"So you're saying that the van incident was an accident, as was the attempt to back up over him; the cattleprod thing was a spur of the moment solution to a technical problem and the names are just workplace fun.\" \n\"Yes!\" \n\"OK, all that aside then, how do you explain this?\" she asks, handing over a photo of the PFY and the Boss that I was hoping wouldn't surface. \n. . . \n\"So how did it go?\" the PFY asks, when I get back to Mission Control. \n\"She bought the stuff about the van, the names and the cattleprod, but I'm not too sure about the other one. I attacked the poor quality of the image, the accuracy of time on the CCTV systems and suggested that there were many ways to interpret it in non-violent connotations, but I'm not sure how well it went down. She suggested that she might call the director and you might... apologise?\" \n\"TO A DWARF!?\" the PFY cries, just as the director swaggers in with a victorious expression on his face. \nUh-oh. \n\"So,\" he says, as he approaches the PFY's desk. \"Anything you'd like to say to me?\" \n\"I...\" he starts. \n\"I think what my assistant might be trying to say is...\" \n\"I'd like him to say it,\" the Director says - in the manner of one who'd fly a copper kite from a church steeple in a lightning storm. \n\"And he will,\" I say. \"Only we discussed it and felt that the embarrassment you'd suffered could not be removed by simple words.

Obviously there’ll need to be the odd bit of maintenance work...” \n. . . \n“You can’t go there,” the Director says. \n“Are you sure?” the PFY asks, waving the ‘insulation tester’ around. \n“It’s not me!” he snivels. “Security want it for their main office, stores want it for the main store and the accountants want it for storing our paper records.” \n. . . One large building fire later . . . \n“Someone’s going to have to pay for this,” the head beancounter sniffs as the fire brigade hose a stack of ashen paper out of one of the basement storerooms. \n“And so they should!” the PFY says. “Who was it said we should only do the mandatory servicing on our fire and intrusion alarms?” \n. . . \n“So it’s just you, security and stores then?” the director asks later in the day. “And I take it there will be no more suspicious fires?” \n“You have to be joking – no, this has to be settled amicably between colleagues. The PFY will see how they’d like to do it.” \n. . . \n“So it’s a game of darts then?” the PFY says to the stores and security managers. \n“Uh-huh,” they respond in unison. “Cider darts!” \n. . . \n“You’re really going to play darts for your rooms?” the Boss asks. \n“ Cider darts,” the PFY corrects. \n“What’s that then?” \n“A pint of cider to start,” the security manager says, trundling over under the weight of a pile of lunchtime kebabs. “A pint of cider per round, a pint of cider if a dart misses the board or bounces back onto the floor. A pint of cider to finish.” \n“Catch it with your foot?” the PFY asks. \n“If you catch a bounced dart with your foot before it hits the floor, you can replay it without forfeit,” the stores manager nods. \n“Injury time?” \n“Forfeit the game.” \n“Are you sure you want to do this?” the Boss whispers to me, moments later. “They look like they’re pretty good.” \n“They should be – they’ve both got pub teams, and one of the stores guys brews his own cider.” \n“You don’t stand a chance!” the Boss gasps. \n“’Least we’re having a go though!” I say, as the PFY wanders off to set up the board and grab a couple of dozen boxes of pikey mouthwash. \n. . . The next day . . . \n“How did it go?” the Boss asks. \n“Mint!” the PFY says. “Touch and go for a while, but in the end we won by forfeit.” \n“How?” \n“Foot injuries from trying to catch a bounced dart.” \n“Both teams?!” \n“Yep.” \n“Don’t they both wear steel caps?” \n“They do, but a steel cap boot is a poor protection from a dart body made out of a rare earth magnet, expelled from the board by a toned down pinch...” the PFY continues. \n“I...” the Boss says, after we explain the basic concepts. “And so you won?” \n“Well after the PFY had nailed one of the stores guy’s feet to one of the security guy’s feet to the wall behind them it was a bit of a non-event.” \n“And there’ll be no... repercussions?” \n“Nah, we let them keep the cider!” \n"}

I was reading an analysis of propeller design with a view to increasing the efficiency of fans and it appears that sharpening the leading edge can lead to efficiencies of up to 0.7 per cent in power consumption.” \n\"You did this just to save 0.7 per cent of a 200mW fan?!\" \n\"That's a 500mW fan - because of the metal blades,\" the PFY counters. \"But anyway, I did it because it was funny. The 0.7 per cent saving just justified me doing it during work time.\" \n\"It's bloody irresponsible!\" he whines, directing the focus of his annoyance at me. \n\"No it's not - the fan's got a guard!\" the PFY says. \n\"Not on the inside of the case it doesn't!\" \n\"Yes but it does say on the outside of the case that you should ensure power is disconnected before opening it - we always do.\" \n\"I was diagnosing a power supply fault!\" he snaps. \n...and so it goes... \nThe trouble with getting rid of an engineer who's become a royal pain in the arse is that it takes so much time to wear them down. Whereas your ordinary engineer will start crying if a power supply fails twice in a row, your RPITA variety of engineer is quite happy to come on site time after time to replace the same part over and over again, without ever wondering why or trying to diagnose the real cause. By the time the roulette wheel of engineer assignment spins in your favour and you get someone who knows what they're doing that dodgy capacitor on the motherboard has been responsible for more outages than a union official. Stronger measures need to be taken... \n\"And quite frankly you should earth your racks - I could've been killed!\" the engineer adds. \n\"Yes,\" the PFY says, disguising disappointment as thoughtfulness. \nIt's a twofold upset for the PFY and myself - firstly the fan didn't result in some sick leave and the desired engineer reassignment and secondly the hour or so that I put into separating an earth lead from its tab inside a power supply then gently teasing the phase wire into contact with the metal body (all through the cooling fan grill so as leave the tamper-evident seals intact) was wasted. \nThe hour spent insulating the rack from any earthing was a waste as well, but at least we can write that off as planning for future requirements... \nThe 'great' thing about crap engineers is that they don't let something like not knowing anything about the product hamper them in any way. They're quite prepared to lift the cover on something, pull the memory out, hold the memory in their mouth while they bend a couple of heatsinks out of the way looking for a loose wire, shove the memory back in the slot, reseat it with a small amount of pressure, a medium amount of pressure, a large amount of pressure, then realise it's in the wrong way and repeat the pressure install method, shut the cover then realise they've been working on the wrong machine the whole time - and maybe they should have turned the power off first... \nThe PFY, while I've been recounting this, has been fielding calls from beatnik central about when their machines are going to be configured... Things look like getting a little, well... testy. Especially as I notice the PFY reverting to his newly mastered 'predictive obscenity filtering' technique... \n\"What's going on with the Design Office?\" the IT director cries, stomping into Mission Control with a definite bee in his bonnet. \n\"Design Office?\" \n\"Yes, the design office! They say that an important company brochure about the relocation is being held up by their inability to use their desktops.\" \n\"Oh that,\" the PFY says. \"That's because they're Macs. I don't know anything about Macs!\" \n\"Oh they're easy,\" our Engineer pipes up, playing right into the PFY's digits. \"They're just like PCs.\" \n\"Really? Well how we trade jobs and I fix this while you fix the Macs upstairs.\" \n\"I... Well, it'll cost you a few beers.\" \n\"Done!\" the PFY snaps. \nMoments later the engineer's off to do battle with the inbreds while the PFY and I have a live chassis server to install. If only... \n\"Uh - you couldn't give us a hand getting this back into the rack could you?\" the PFY asks, nodding. \n\"For Pete's sake, there's two of you! What do you need?\" \n\"Basically someone just needs to hold the machine into the rack while we power it up...\" the PFY says. \nKZZZERT! \nAnd then there were two... \n"}

Still, it's not me that will be deciding, it's these people.\" \nThe Boss hands over a document from a consultancy firm and the PFY bashes the name into a search engine. \n\"Hmm,\" he mumbles, looking at the company's website. \n\"What?\" \n\"They say that the partners have a combined experience in computing of over 60 years.\" \n\"And the company consists of a couple of COFs?\" I suggest. \n\"COFs? What's a COF?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Crusty Old Fart. I.e. someone who was there when dirt was invented.\" \n\"I hardly think...\" \n. . . \nOur worst fears are realised at the first site meeting when they start questioning the amount of space we want to get our hands on... \n\"I can't see what the problem is,\" I say, walking with the consultants through the gutted heart of our soon-to-be-created computer suite. \n\"Leaving aside the assumption that we'd approve the separate comms room with the advances in structured cabling in the past 10 years,\" one of the COFs says. \"The size you're proposing is huge! You've allocated about 1\/5th of the floor!\" \n\"Just planning for the future,\" I say as my dreams of a rent-free city flat hiccup briefly. \n\"And what part in the future does this plant access shaft play?\" the other COF asks, tapping the area of the plan where we're planning to put our fireman's pole. \n\"Where's that then?\" the PFY asks shoving a builder's trolley loaded with concrete out of the way. \n\"Here,\" the first COFs says, stepping over to a section of the floor marked out in yellow chalk and concrete dust. \n\"Oh that! That would be a central riser for all the supporting plant - the access path for power, chilled coolant, makeup air, etc.\" the PFY lies. \"It's key to the build.\" \n\"It doesn't look all that key to us,\" he counters. \"You could put all your plant in the computer suite and save a valuable amount of what was once car parking space in the floor below - not to mention the loss of floor space on this level.\" \n\"How much floor space are we really losing?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Fifteen square meters – roughly,\" the second COF says. \n\"How much exactly ?\" \n\"Okay we'll tell you,\" the second COF snaps, entering the chalk outline and handing his partner the end of a measuring tape. \"... 4.4 metres by 3.7 metres is >tappity< sixteen point two eight square metres.

I say new Boss, as the previous one that everyone liked left for greener pastures and then his replacement left on medical grounds after accidentally pushing a paperclip into the live pin of a power socket - being misinformed by someone that it would improve his AM radio reception - scant MINUTES after telling the PFY and I that he was concerned about our high internet usage... \nCoincidences abound. \nMore importantly, with the new building and the forward thinking the whole company has signed itself up for an \"Into the Future\" initiative for which we're beta testing a robotic brain as a boss while we wait for the appointments process to grind on... I've no idea whose bright idea it was but apparently it came down from 'the very top' so we're now lumbered with a first generation beta test android with a particularly slow processor, limited memory, noisy paging disk and resource contention problems - so no change there. \nThe large packing crate outside the office was a bit of a giveaway, as was the couple of whitecoats who came from 'an IT personnel consultancy' to help him settle in. The saddest thing, however, is that even without human emotion the robot still gets on better with the staff than his immediate predecessor. \nI note a couple of sheets of A4 in the boss's claw, which tends to sway the argument of the Boss's purpose in favour of a technical problem. However, we have been a little barren in the toilet tissue department since the PFY complained to the buildings maintenance manager about the toilet fresheners in the bottom of the urinal, saying he preferred the menthol to the eucalyptus flavour... \nSigh. \n\"Back the way you came, first left, second right after the lifts!\" the PFY says, before the Boss has a chance to engage his voice circuits. \"Leave them in the cubicle.\" \n\"What?\" he starts, stopping mid roll, scanning the room slowly for signs of intelligent life. \n\"The toilets.\" \n\"Oh. No. I was looking for.... >grind grind grind< the person who signed this form.\" \n\"No L2 cache at all,\" the PFY mouths at me before he turns back to the Roboboss. \"Which form?\" \n\"This form,\" the boss responds, releasing the paper onto the PFY's desk. \n\"Let's have a look at this, blah blah blah, secret weapon, blah blah, maintenance... Yes, it's the maintenance contract for our telephone exchange.\" \n\"For 13 thousand pounds.

I estimate this would save the company ten thousand pounds per annum,\" the Roboboss warbles. \n\"But then we won't be invited to the telco end-of-year bash,\" the PFY whines. \"They have cider girls!\" \n\"This would not factor into the calculation of savings.\" \n\"Yes, but it's a really good party!\" the PFY says. \"The place is next door is a boutique cider brewery and they have some sort of contra arrangement for phone support which makes for a pretty exciting event!\" \n\"This would not factor into the calculation of savings.\" \n\"So what are your priorities for your role?\" I ask. \"If that's not leaking too much of your programming to us.\" \n\"Prioritised targets are cost savings, stability of service, risk assurance and potential liability.\" \n\"And staff morale?\" \n\"This would not figure into my calculations.\" \n\"Health and safety?\" \n\"This would not figure into my calculations.\" \n\"So what you're saying is that savings are your priority and people are not?\" \n\"They do not factor into my calculation of savings.\" \n\"Did you realise that the finance department of this company allocates IT budget and by increasing our budget you could increase your savings targets exponentially?\" \n\">whirr<\" \n\"...and that a large portion of the budget that is not allocated to us is made up by the salaries of the people who staff the finance department?\" \n\">whirr<\" \n\"...and that if less people worked for the finance department you could achieve the exponential savings?\" \n\">whirr<\" \n\"...and that there's a chainsaw behind my assistant's desk fuelled up and ready to go?\" \n\">whirr< >click< Savings computed!\" \nAs the robot grasps the chainsaw and heads to the lift I can't help thinking that... ...the new Boss is shouting at me. \n\"YOU'RE ASLEEP!\" he snaps, as I lurch forward in my chair. \n\"Just resting my eyes,\" I say. \"The screens are very harsh on your eyes.\" \n\"You weren't listening to me, I was saying your internet usage figures are outrageous.\" \n\"Oh, yes, of course.

Even under threat of arrest Childs failed to cough up the goods, prompting officers to take him into custody on Sunday. \nThe sysadmin, who draws a basic salary of around $126,000, has worked for the Department of Technology for around five years. Childs was recently the target of disciplinary action over his allegedly poor performance at work. The San Francisco Chronicle quotes anonymous city officials in support of a theory that Childs rigged the system as an \"insurance policy\" against getting fired. \nAt a press conference on Monday, city officials said they were making progress in regaining control of the system, which is up and running but inaccessible. Investigators reckon Child started making changes to the system around a month ago on 20 June. They claim that undoing the damage he allegedly caused via the denial of service attack could cost \"millions\" of dollars. Even taking into account lost productivity this estimates seems high and probably represent an attempt to up the ante in the prosecution of Childs in the hope that he'll back down when faced by the prospect of more serious charges. \nThe San Francisco Chronicle reports city officials' fear that Childs may have an accomplice capable of further damaging the system even as Childs cools his heels in jail. So far police have found nothing to back up a theory that some type of electronic device might feature in such a putative attack. Childs' bail has been set at $5m, The Mercury News adds . \nNathan Ballard, a spokesman for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, said he was \"confident that [the Department of Technology] is doing everything necessary to maintain the integrity of the city's computer networks.\" [Ed: where's Dirty Harry when you need him?] \nRon Vinson, chief administrative officer for the Department of Technology, said city officials were \"working around the clock\" to restore access. Ironically, Childs received an additional salary payment of $22,534 last year for serving as an on-call trouble shooter, The San Francisco Chronicle adds. ® \n"}

So who are you using? Me, right, but who else?\" \n\"A couple of fellow bastards from the place down the street that frequent the pub, plus the Boss and the IT Director.\" \n\"Really - and you think that'll cut it?\" \n\"I'm not sure they actually look at the references too carefully - and anyway I faked some reference templates and inserted them into the Boss and Director's Word hierarchy. If they deviate too far from the template they'll have to write the whole thing themselves and I think we both know they're about as creative as...\" \n\"The team that nicked the Mac look and feel - yes.

Not only have I alluded to the fact that in his preschool years the PFY singlehandedly made a Babbage engine out of Meccano, I've also suggested that he was in fact the original developer of Windows but lost all his designs when he accidentally left his school bag on the tube while Bill Gates was in town on holiday. Able to to perform long division in hexadecimal in his head while writing Lisp code to parse foreign languages, the PFY also has a hidden side to his personality that many people don't know of, where he donates old computers to schools and helps senior citizens master the basics of computing. \nSo he should be sleeping soundly by the end of next week. \nAnd so it was that the next afternoon my web-based study into the hobbies of supermodels is interrupted by the incessant ringing of the PFY's phone. He's still not back from lunch and he left at nine! \nRealising that I won't be able to concentrate on the selection process a supermodel goes through to choose a volleyball outfit with the phone ringing, I pick up the PFY's extension. \n\"Hello I'm looking for Simon Tr...\" \n\"That's me,\" I say. \n\"Oh good. I'm just doing a referee check for an Operations Management position and one of the candidates has produced a reference from you and I'd just like to validate the content - purely a formality, but something we have to do.\" \nTHE LYING BASTARD! \n\"Fair enough,\" I say, suppressing the urge to slam the phone down. \n\"So I'll just read the reference out to you and then ask you to confirm its content,\" she says, before reading my words back to me. \"Is that the reference you supplied?\" \n\"Not exactly,\" I say. \"But it's pretty much there.\" \n\"Are there some alterations you'd like to make?\" she asks. \n\"Oh no, no - the gist of it is there. The illegal dumping of computers, his time helping out the older lags in prison...\" \n\" Prison? \" \n\"Oh don't worry, it's not as bad as it sounds. It was only remand and in the end the whole case was dismissed because the goat lived and the prosecutions vet just... disappeared.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"But what I said about his technical ability is spot on. He can honestly look at the hexadecimal numbers in an image file and tell you how many women are in it and what clothes they're wearing - if any! Honestly it's uncanny and I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't had the misfortune to see him do it.\" \n\"You say he started in computing at a very young age with Meccano?\" \n\"Oh yes, I've seen the family photos. It's such a pity that the police returned the set to his neighbours' place - but luckily being only four they didn't press any charges for burglary. That time.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"I know what you're thinking - he must be a handful to manage with all that... enthusiasm, but I just try and stick to the basics of computing and rein him in. You know, keep customer-focused and supply a reliable and robust infrastructure for the best money possible.\" \n\"Really,\" she asks. \"You're not looking for a change in career are you?\" \n\"You know,\" I say. \"I was just thinking that the other day...\" \n"}

Take my word for it, once we install the racks and the cable trays the place will look half the size.” \n“I... still think it's rather large.” \n“No, no, it's fine,” I say. “Like my assistant says, wait until you see it with the racks and stuff in place – honestly, it'll look tiny.” \n“Are you sure this is the same size as your existing room?” \n“It's a little larger, I admit,” I say. “But who's going to quibble about a foot or two in the scheme of things – and like we've said, it only LOOKS large. When the machines are in place you really will believe it's halved in size.” \nWhich it will have. In a rare moment of self-sacrifice the PFY and I have actually dipped into our own pockets to pay the builders for several nights of private work of installing four mammoth but silent electrical motors and building a remote control movable steel wall through the middle of the computer room - creating two suites, the work one and the private enterprise version. \nIt was the beancounters' idea really – they'd been reading so much about SAAS recently that they were convinced that we were over-investing in our infrastructure and should instead utilise the resources of an external vendor. \nWhich is where the PFY and I came in. By halving the size of the computer room and installing the best of our existing servers in a virtual cluster in the ghost facility, we'll 'migrate' our desktop functionality to the most competitive 'external provider' who responds to the RFP. And who's going to be more competitive than a provider that doesn't have to pay for kit, power, plant or real estate? \nIt just makes financial sense – at least that's the way the beancounters saw it when they pored over the RFP responses. In an effort to be scrupulously fair the PFY and I did try and nudge them toward the other more costly respondents so as not to unfairly bias the decision in our favour, but even after our best endeavours they still decided to go with the cheapest model. \nAh well. \nSo the only problem we have is that we overlooked the segment of the RFP which stated that the company wanted a seamless transition... \nThe computer room meanwhile progresses nicely. Within hours of the beancounter's visit the racks are in standing in what will be their final locations and the wall is now the only structure I know of with the ability to alter its location to GPS coordinates which have been texted to it. A work of bloody genius! \n“I... It really does look smaller!” the beancounter gasps as he returns to the room. “But surely that's never 40 metres?” \n“Forty metres?” I say grabbing the plans from his hands. “No, I see the mistake – this measurement is in chains - point four chains.” \n“Chains?” \n“Yeah, it's an old building, it'll be from the original surveyors notes.” \n“But then four chains would make that about... uh... about five metres.” \n“That’s about right isn’t it?” \n“No, you see, the room is the correct width – in metres – but the length of the room is ridiculously small – about two-thirds of what it should be.” \n“It’s probably a typographical error.” \n“No it’s not - the picture shows it as being as long as the corridor over here plus the length of your office.” \n“No, there must be a room missing somewhere. How far is it from the security doors to the end of the room?” the PFY asks as we step out through the doors concerned. \n“I’ll check >stomp< >stomp< …. >stomp< 12. So that’s probably just over nine metres.” \n“What about from the end of the room to the doors?” the PFY asks. \n“The same as the other way.” \n“You’re not taking into account Earth’s rotation and doppler effect,” the PFY says, TXTing furiously behind his back. \n“Eh?” \n“The wall, it won’t be in the same place because of the earth’s rotation,” the PFY says. “Just put your back heel on the wall and count the steps this way.” \n...20 seconds later... \n“It’s strange,” he says. “It’s just over 10.5 metres now.” \n“Check it again,” the PFY suggests. >tappity< \n“12 metres, it just doesn’t make sense!” he says. “It’s like this is moving >clonk< >clonk< Hey, that wall's made of steel! You know I think the wall really is...“ \n>SLAM< >CLANG< >CLANG< \n>tappity< \nNo one believes the beancounter’s tale the next day when he turns up to work reeking heavily of bodily outputs after being crammed between some crushed racks overnight thanks to the PFY’s coordinates being about six inches into the back wall... His fanciful tales of rooms closing in on him are put down to his abuse of the many empty boxes of cold medication that the PFY planted in his rubbish bin… \nThe subsequent site visit shows the server room is exactly as specified in the plans. \n“Though it looks half the size when the racks are in there,” the PFY adds, as our visitors depart. \n>tappity< \n"}

The migration of the server room to the new site and the transfer of our 'crucial' services to the successful tendering party (ie our ghost facility) is about to commence. \n\"But I still don't see why we need to pay a data transfer fee!\" the Boss whinges. \n\"Because they'll need to put a high speed link into the building for the weekend to enable them to transfer out data to the new hardware,\" the PFY says, never one to miss an opportunity to gouge the company for an extra couple of hundred quid. \"Otherwise they'd have to copy over the VPN link, and that'd take days to complete.\" \n\"Why do they need to take a copy anyway?\" the Boss whines. \"They're taking the servers with them!\" \n\"It'll save on recovery time if the servers get damaged in transit,\" the PFY says. \n\"But surely that's their problem?\" the Boss says. \"In any case why don't we just buy more tapes and you two backup the systems before they go?\" \n\"It's the least costly option,\" I respond, not wanting to spend a Friday night at work pretending to backup data just to claim the overtime. \"If you were to pay us overtime it'll work out to be more expensive than putting the temporary data link in.\" \nAnd so it goes. The work the PFY and I are putting into convincing the Boss that he should pay us some lager money is starting to be more effort than we first thought. It's getting to the point that one of us is likely to say... \n\"You're right!\" the PFY snaps. \"I'm sure nothing will go wrong.

Instead of looking blankly at the rubble and reaching for the chequebook, he starts sorting things into their component piles. While the mess - the guts of half a dozen inkjet printers, several 10 meg hubs, a pile of old servers, a broken portable air conditioner (the PFY was 'in the zone'), and two filing drawers of ISA cards (still in the filing cabinet - the zone is infectious) - might be enough to dupe the Boss into believing that half the contents of the computer room have done a two-floor freefall, this bloke isn't fooled as easily. \n\"Hmmm\" he says, doing the full CSI workup on the stairwell bannister. \"Yes...\" \n\"What?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Just a moment,\" he says, climbing some more stairs. \"Mmmmm...\" \n\"What is it?\" \n\"Well, let's see,\" he says. \"I can see from the marks on the wall and on the bannister suggesting that the servers fell a completely different way to the networking gear. And the filing cabinet fell another way altogether. At first glance it would look like someone had simply... thrown all this equipment off the 2nd floor landing, and that no accident took place at all.\" \n\"Are you absolutely sure?\" the PFY asks, waving his money machine card out of the Boss's line of sight. \n\"Er... as I said, at first glance you'd think that was the case - and that the wreckage at the bottom of the stairwell was just the usual end-of-life crap that only ever gets moved anywhere when an IT crowd has to vacate their workspace - but I'm not so sure. I'll need to take a better look. And I'll need your technical people to give me a hand with the investigation. Perhaps we could meet up again in... ten minutes?\" \n...Ten minutes and one extortion (so large it verged on being proctology) later... \n\"Yes, well I think we've sorted it out and we'll accept your claim,\" the agent says, while patting a large lump of the PFY's cash safely stashed in his pocket. \"It obviously happened as they described and you've lost several expensive top-of-the-line servers. This >scribble< is your accept claim number, which I've rung through to our 24-hour line so you should be able to replace the kit as of Monday.

I'll take a quick look before I go.\" \n\"It's just up here...\" the PFY says, disappearing up the stairs. \nThe Boss has barely begun to discuss what we'll do with the insurance money when our conversation is interrupted by a >crash!< \n\"What was that?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Well, I'm no expert,\" I say. \"And I'm not up with the insurance game.

Whether it's the contrast of old and new (i.e. the ancient glass fronted axe cases in the stairwell which no-one in their right mind would install these days, versus the almost ubiquitous security cameras which everyone seems to be installing these days) is hard to say.... \nOne thing that remains the same, though, is the users. While the PFY's engaged in some scheme to disguise the true size of the server room, I'm spending my valuable time teaching a user how to fix the poorly designed software with the cowboy installer that he's just downloaded from the web and stuffed onto his machine – with the usual unexpected results. \nAnd the worst thing about teaching a user how to do something is that it's always about ten times slower than doing it yourself and akin to using the world's laggiest KVM solution as you instruct them where to put their mouse, which button to click, when, and what do once they've clicked it. It's all because of a new policy the Boss has decided to adopt for IT support – something to do with teaching a person to fish (which, once we considered the high levels of mercury in seafood, was fine by the PFY and myself). \nStill, it's a challenge to even the most patient of people when your user fails to grasp the simplest point and click concepts – especially when you know that the moment you leave the room they'll be paraphrasing your instructions in an effort to pass themselves off as an IT guru. \n“You want to open the INI file with WordPad and remove the line which says 64 bit,” I say. \n. . . \n“No, the INI file,” I repeat. \n. . . \nThe one with DOT I-N-I at the end,” I say helpfully. “No, NOT THAT ONE! The one with the same name as your application. Just quit out of that one, that's your machine's boot order. No DON'T SAVE IT, you've chopped a line off the top! DON'T Re..! Why the HELL did you reboot?!” I snap, thinking for a moment about the 'sanity instillers' in their easily-broken display cases in the stairwell. Then about the security cameras... \n“I'm... going to have to go back to my office and get a boot CD,” I say, exiting before something bad happens. \nMy trip to our new Mission Control for Knoppix therapy is intercepted by the Boss. \n“I suppose this ridiculous plan is your idea!” he snaps, oozing the sort of sarcasm which will see him second in my mental list of “people most likely to come into contact with a rusty fire axe in the next few hours if they're not careful”. \n“What plan, what idea?” I ask. \n“Follow me!” he snaps, leading the way through Mission Control, down the shiny new services corridor, into the server room, stopping momentarily >bip< >bip< to read a text message from the service desk's call escalation paging system. \n“It's... beautiful!” I say, admiring the PFY's handiwork as I step into the server room. \n“It is isn't it?” the PFY says proudly. \n“It's like being in a geeky Tardis!” I gasp, looking around me happily. \n“I know!” the PFY bubbles, to the Boss's annoyance. \n“How long did it take to put them up?” I ask. \n“I started last night,” he admits. “And finished about half an hour ago.” \nI have to hand it to the PFY, it's like a work of art – there must be at least a thousand mirror tiles covering the walls of the server room - making the place look ten times its half-size. \n“I had a few boxes left over so I did the corridor as well,” the PFY adds, still smiling away to himself. \n“And the glass door?” I ask. \n“Not just ANY glass door,” the PFY says. “It's 42mm armour glass and weighs so much it needs special hinges. Not only can it can stop a bullet, it can also stop an IT manager who has a parallax error because the corridor walls are mirrored too... \n“Ah, that'll account for the smudge,” I say. \n“It's a stupid idea,” the Boss says, >bip< >bip< pausing to read yet another text helldesk message. “And dangerous too.” \n“Stupid?” I say. “But with these mirrors we'll be able to see a service lamp from almost anywhere in the room. And safe because you'll be able to find faults before they turn into something much worse!” \n“It's stupid,” the Boss says. “And I want them removed!” \n“But they're glued on!” the PFY replies. “They'd rip all the wall lining out!” \n“And it might be asbestos,” I add, just for old time's sake. \n“It's not asbestos and the walls can be relined,” the boss snaps. “That's what we've got a decorating budget for.” \n“What do you think paid for the mirror tiles?” the PFY asks. \"Not to mention the door!\" \n“I...” the Boss says, winding up for a real whine. >bip< >bip< “Oh for Pete's sake, would you go and look at that application install at finance!” \n“I was on my way when you grabbed me,” I respond, now feeling suddenly cheerful. “Anyway, it's only one machine.” \n“It was one machine before, but it's all of them now,” he says, reading from his phone. “They'd all installed that application, which was fine till they used your instructions to fix it.” \n“MY instructions?!” I seethe, feelings of cheer gone. \n\"Yes - and you'd better get a wiggle on as there's a pay run due this afternoon.\" \n\"Get a wi..\" I gasp, before the finality of the situation grabs me. \"Of course, I'll get right onto it - but could you do me a favour and get the door to the stairwell?\" \n\"I... suppose so.\" \n. . . \n>tinkle< \n. . . \n"}

And let's not forget - they were the cheapest.\" \n\"Cheapest?\" the PFY blurts. \"They were the most expensive!\" \n\"No, they were the cheapest,\" the Boss counters. \"Perhaps you didn't see the final contract - I managed to talk them down to a third of what they originally quoted.\" \n\"Do you have a copy of the contracts?\" the PFY asks \n\"I... sure,\" the Boss says, rustling around in some folders on his desk \"This.. >shuffle< is the original contract and... here's >shuffle< the revised one. I'm quite the negotiator.\" \n\"Yes,\" the PFY says, skimming the pages. \"Quite a coup. You managed to get them to reduce the price to a third of the original and substitute the word Monthly for the original Annually.\" \n\"I, what?!\" he gasps, snatching the papers back quickly. \"THE BASTARDS!!! Why that's... uh... \" \n\"Four times the original price?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"The F****G PR**KS!!\" the Boss shouts, knocking the papers off his desk in a fury. \n\"And you can bet they did it on purpose,\" the PFY says. \"They're probably laughing their arses off now, what with the crap network and all.\" \n\"RIGHT, THEY'RE NOT GETTING AWAY WITH IT, WE'LL BLOODY SUE!\" \nIt's funny what can pop into your mind when you're bored, isn't it? One minute you're sitting in your nice new office in a nice new building, while your assistant is pretending to work in the nice new server room - when really he's next door in the nice new ghost facility taking care of a couple of backups on the systems we're pretending to host offsite for a huge amount of cash... \nAnd then suddenly, for no reason at all, you just reach over and type RELOAD on the core router's console window. And then you make a rule for yourself that every time you get a coffee you'll do it again. And then you start to feel a little bad - because seven cups of coffee is rather a lot for a morning... \nSwapping the revised contract for the monthly one was the PFY's idea. \n\"You know what?\" the PFY says. \"Better than sue them, we should publish all this on the web. We should post just what we think about them and their crap service!\" \n\"You're right!\" the Boss says, snatching up his keyboard and tapping away furiously. \"How do you spell shitcake - with a hyphen?\" \n\"I prefer without...\" \nA quarter of an hour later, the PFY gives me the prearranged signal and I rock on up to the Boss's desk. \n\"That's that router problem sorted out then,\" I say to the PFY. \"Turns out that the word RELOAD was stored in the terminal program's callback buffer and one of the interfaces had a control-E in its name.\" \n\"Oh,\" the PFY says, faking illumination. \"So every time you'd show the interfaces the router would reboot and take the network out?\" \n\"I know - all my fault,\" I say. \"So lucky we didn't sue after all - what with one of their major investors being that rampant solicitor and all.

At 175 meters you could probably have run it to the toilets and back, just to be on the safe side.” \n“They made us do it,” Clint – I mean Steve – blurts, much to Dave's annoyance. \n“Who made you do it?” \n“The bloke in the office. He said they'd pay extra if we didn't go through the comms rooms.” \n“Ah, so you're saying that one of the beancounters told you to link between offices on different floors – presumably so they wouldn't be subject to our patching regime?” I ask. \n“I... suppose so,” Dave says, not wanting to get too involved in any office politics. Smart man. \n“And the cable – it was rated for POE?” \n“Which standard? 12, 24, 48 volt, 20 watts?” \n“I was thinking more along the lines of 240 Volt up to 20 Amps,” the PFY says. \n...One night and one small faceplate fire later... \n“I don't understand it,” one of the beancounters sniffs. \n“Well it was quite simple really,” the PFY lies. “It seems that a section of unapproved data cabling must have worn through some power cabling with the vibration of the aircon unit that it was cable tied to, causing a massive increase in current down the line.” \n“I wasn't talking about the power thing.” \n“Oh you mean the fires?” \n“You said it was smoke!” he bleats. “From the wall socket.” \n“We call that a fire,” the PFY says, condescendingly. “Because where there's smoke...” \n“Yes, but why did you have to put an axe through my LCD monitor and my desktop machine? They can't have been on fire!” \n“Can never be too careful,” the PFY says. “Fire can spread like lightning – and as we all know lightning travels at 186,000 miles per second! You should be thanking me!” \n“And my iPod,” he sniffs. \n“It was plugged into the desktop – no doubt charging. No telling what might have happened if the battery had exploded! And again, I was rather expecting a bit of gratitude...” \n“And the server upstairs?” \n“Fire's a tricky beast. I trust my supervisor's decision to hose it down until he was sure it was completely safe!” \n“Yes but he hosed down every machine in the room - as well as our filing cabinets and my manager's bonsai.” \n“Yes, \" the PFY responds. \" Unfortunately though, the problem was that the cable wasn't in the structured cabling system so we couldn't use netdisco to figure out which machine might be affected. Ultimately we had to choose safety first and hose down everything. \n“And this all happened in the middle of the night you say?” \n“Yes, and it was lucky we were both here,” the PFY says. “Or things might have been different.” \n\"You'd be surprised at the number of situations we're able to resolve out of hours just by happenstance,\" I add, jumping into the conversation. \n\"Although we'll still be putting this down as a callout,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Well we won't be paying!\" \n\"Now now,\" I say, defusing the situation. \"You say that, but I'm sure you see the value of a few pennies expended so that my assistant and myself stop off for a quick look-around before going home after a vendor presentation. Just to make sure things are OK.\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Not even to make sure some poor bean... accountant such as yourself hasn't had a nasty accident and been trapped in the lift for hours and hours?\" \n\"I... I'll see what I can do.\" \n"}

We've also lined up a bouncer from a local pub to dress in khaki and 'act military', dropping the occasional bit of IT patter. To complete the picture we've asked the Boss and Beancounter to supply scans of their passports 'for ID verification and validation purposes'. \n. . . \nA day later and the Boss and Beancounter are ushered out of the freight elevator looking slightly dishevelled - thanks to the PFY's high speed negotiation of a couple of the city's parks. \n\"So this is it then?\" the Beancounter asks angrily. \"All that money for this?\" \n\"State of the art facility, this,\" our bouncer says. \n\"It's no better or worse than we have in our own building!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"It may as well be our building,\" the Beancounter fumes. \"We're being ripped off!\" \nI'm wondering if the PFY can hear any of this, watching us - as he is - from the CCTV monitor beside the Halon release in the next room... \n\"And we pay all that money for THIS?\" the Boss snarls as our security guard departs 'to do his rounds'. \n\"It's a state of the art room with redundant UPS, Environme-\" \n\"I don't care if it's got state of the art bloody environmental monitoring with round the clock surveillance...\" \n\"Actually, it has,\" I murmur. \n\"...we're being ripped off!

We also say it's merely a precaution and completely harmless so long as the minimum safe viewing distance is observed.\" \n\"What's the minimum safe viewing distance?\" \n\"There isn't one - which will make them even more suspicious.\" \n\"Then there's this,\" the PFY adds, holding up a box. \n\"What's that?\" \n\"A Geiger counter,\" the PFY says, \"with the guts removed and a tiny circuit that just makes the occasional crackle and moves the needle randomly at the low end of the scale.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because sooner or later someone will hold it up to their ancient radium dial watch and notice that it doesn't crackle any more or less than it does any other time.\" \n\"Then they'll open it up and find there's no workings inside apart from the tiny circuit and some old batteries wrapped in insulation tape to give the unit some weight - and be positive there's a problem,\" I add. \n\"Then I'll go round assuring everyone that things are OK and the only other options are some old CRTs...\" \n\"After shaving off small chunks of his hair,\" I add. \n\"I... do you think it'll work?\" \n\"Hell yeah. Half of them will be off sick with headaches within the week and we'll swap CRT screens in while they're away,\" \n\"But didn't you dump the old screens?\" the Boss asks \n\"I did, but I'm sure we can pick up some here and there for... I dunno.. 10, 20 quid apiece.\" \n\"So what are we looking at?\" \n\"Maybe a couple of grand?\" the PFY says \n\"Plus the dumping fee for the LCDs - another two and a half,\" I chip in. \n\"I thought it only cost five quid?!\" \n\"Five quid for mercury, but it's ten quid for radiation because they have to ship them to Liverpool - where birth defects would largely go unnoticed.\" \n\"And premature death is a blessing,\" the PFY adds. \n. . . The next day . . . \n\"Jerry\" I say \"I've got those 240 LCD screens you were after - what did we say, 50 quid apiece?\" \n\"Forty.\" \n\"Forty-five.\" \n\"Deal. Now, got any wheely chairs? The company's looking for about 100 or so...\" \n. . . That afternoon. . . \n\"Did you know that the gas piston in wheely chairs can explode?\" the Boss whines, as an ambulance bears a poor unfortunate from Beancounter central away... \n"}

Not only has he inserted entries into Wikipedia, he's fabricated websites, complete with photos of IT types pointing at graphs (one of these quite patently the barman of the local pub in a suit jacket with some pens stuck in the top pocket). \n\"So what's this got to do with you needing a new desktop machine?\" the Boss asks, admitting defeat. \n\"Look, if you take Moore's law into account...\" \n\"Which one?\" the Boss says sarcastically. \n\"Both of them,\" the PFY says. \"Anyway, if you take into account Moore's' laws then my machine...\" \n\"Which is only... ten and a half months old,\" the Boss points out. \n\"...is already over halfway through its useful life. So if I'm to remain abreast of current technology I should be replacing it every nine months!\" \n\"As should I,\" I put in, not wanting to miss out on a new gaming rig either.. \n\"Three hundred quid for a Graphics adapter!\" the Boss says, pointing at a line item. \n\"I need one to run two screens simultaneously at high res!\" the PFY insists. \n\"You don't HAVE two high res screens,\" the Boss retorts. \n\"They're mentioned the seventh line down\" the PFY sniffs. \n\"We can't afford it!\" \n\"Which, his one or my one?\" I ask. \n\"Either one.\" \n!!! \nIt's one thing to deny the PFY a new machine, what with his flimsy arguments about needing it and all, but it's quite another to deny me the chance to improve my service level to the users. Particularly when I happen to have laid my hands on a pre-pre-release copy of FEAR2... \n\"But this is a priority!!\" I gasp. \"Can't we cut something less important from the budget - like those multifunction printers - no one uses all the features on them! They'd be happy with the old lasers they used to have.\" \n\"It's too late, the multifunction devices have already been bought,\" the Boss says, handing another page over. \"There's barely enough money left to cover paper.\" \n\"I... that's what a printer costs!?!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"No, that's what a toner cartridge costs,\" the Boss responds. \"Apparently the contract that my predecessor signed gives the MFD outfit exclusive rights to all the company's printing at 1.25 p a page and includes all expenses apart from paper and toner cartridges. No one thought of checking the toner cartridge cost. The company either goes paperless or the IT department will go bankrupt.\" \n\"Not a worry >clickety<\" the PFY says, shutting down the print server. \"Now, about that new desktop?\" \n\"I think it's going to take a lot more than that to make the printer company re-evaluate the two year lease...\" \n\"YOU SIGNED A TWO YEAR LEASE!\" the PFY gasps, horrified at the possibility of being the laughing stock of his gaming peers with the oldest desktop... \n\"Let's just calm down,\" I say quietly. \"I'm sure the printer company will see reason and let us out of our contract.\" \n. . . \n\"It's a signed contract,\" the MFD rep says, \"and as such I'm unable to do anything about it. It's very clearly stated that we'll pay all expenses except toner cartridges and paper in exchange for the favourable per page printing model proposed.\" \n\"So you're not even going to consider a shorter contract or cheaper toner cartridges?\" I ask \n\"I'd like to help you, but a contract is a contract...\" \n\"Fair enough,\" I say, to the disgust of the Boss. \"Thanks for coming and meeting with us.

Well. I kind of mentioned the paperless office idea to a couple of people and they're quite keen.\" \n\"Are they?\" I ask. \n\"Well if we're talking paperless, check this out,\" the PFY says, pointing to a web page on his screen. \n\"What am I looking at?\" The Boss asks. \n\"It's the website that the caterers use for our meals.\" \n\"Really? So they use real ingredients and not just tramp vomit?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah,\" the PFY says. \"They subscribe to this site, which tells you what meals to prepare for what tier of punter. You choose a week of meals and it orders all the ingredients to be delivered for the food you selected.\" \n\"Tiers?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah. You have the Platinum range, which is CEO material - escargot and all that, Gold, which is the sort of stuff you'd see at a posh catered event, Silver class, which is nice catered food, down through the various other tiers, to us.\" \n\"What's our tier?\" I ask. \n\"Uh... it doesn't actually have a name.\" \n\"If we're talking Platinum, Gold and Silver then we're probably around Lead?\" I ask. \n\"As in poisoning,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Indeed,\" I say. \"But that's probably because 'Transuranic heavy metals may not be used where there is life'\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Nothing, just a quote from the past.\" \n\"Well?\" \n... \n\"Sapphire's not an element!\" the PFY cries a few minutes later, poking a rather nasty hole in TV history. \n\"It hardly matters,\" The boss interjects. \"So this is just a food ordering website saving the hassle of filling out a couple of forms. Surely there's not much paper saving in that?\" \n\"It's more than that,\" the PFY says. \"Each day the caterers go to the website and see the recipe along with pictures and a little video showing how to make it.\" \n\"And?\" the Boss asks. \n\"And they don't print any of it. Though it does look like the web server is particularly poorly protected,\" the PFY hints. \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"Someone could go into the website, make some fairly minor modifications to the recipe and end up with rather nice meat balls instead of the Hungarian glue-lash that they manage to make out of most things.\" \n\"But then you'd need to make a video and have pictures,\" I counter. \n\"Yes, that's where it comes unstuck - you'd only really get away with some minor quantity changes. However, that said, you could just change options on the webpage...\" \n\"You mean like.. change the tier of meals we're getting?\" the Boss asks furtively. \n\"Exactly!\" the PFY responds. \"You could change the tier you want for this week's meals - and they might put it down to a keyboard error if the finance people complained about the end of month bill.\" \n\"So we could get...\" the Boss says. \n\"Chicken korma, Peshawari naan and all the poppadoms you could eat? Yes,\" the PFY responds. \n\"But surely it's password protected?\" \n\"Two minutes with a keypress recorder.\" the PFY says, holding up a sheet of paper with \"CH3F\" written on it. \n\"But surely the cafeteria people would know?\" \nThat's the great thing! The whole site's put together by some publicity seeking pot basher who's promoting new era meals - so the cafeteria staff never know what they'll be cooking from one day to the next.' \n\"I... Let's try it with tomorrow's meals,\" the Boss mumbles. \"Just to see.\" \n\"Okay, I'll just pick something in the silver range,\" the PFY says. \"And the best thing about this >clickety< >tap< Is it's completely >click< paperless, meaning...\" \n\"No audit trail!\" I blurt. \n. . . Lunch time the next day . . . \n\"This is amazing!\" the Boss says, shoveling down a prawn malibari. \n\"True,\" I respond. \"People are racing back for seconds instead of to the toilets!\" \n\"We won't get away with it of course,\" he replies, the voice of reason intruding. \"Finance is bound to find out any day.\" \n\"Yep.

The bloody vendors love it, of course! And if you ring them and ask how many licenses you have you hit that particular portion of their brain affected by amnesia - they've no idea - until the annual maintenance payments are due...\" \n\"But don't we just end up rebuying the software from ourselves?\" \n\"We do, but this way keeps the money inside the company.\" \n\"Till 4pm on a Friday,\" the PFY adds. \n\"At which time it's reinvested in company morale,\" I concur. \n\"So you're planning to just drink the money away?\" \n\"Uh huh,\" the PFY responds. \n\"I think I've got a better idea,\" the Boss says, rubbing his chin. \"Let's talk to the finance people and see if we can't get cost centres paid some nominal fee for returning their software.\" \n\"I don't -\" \n\"PLUS they get an extra, larger payment - say half the product's current buy price if the software is subsequently required in-house. That way they're getting an incentive to return software.\" \n\"What if they subsequently realise that they need the software after all? Won't we look bad?\" \n\"No, because we saved them rebuying it at retail anyway - and as you say, it keeps money inside the company.\" \nBoth the PFY and I are not sure the Boss has fully understood the alcoholic beverage supply aspect of this proposed idea. \n\"I still don't think it will motivate people,\" the PFY says, changing tack. \n\"What about if we had a prizes - for the group who returned the most value, and the group who bought the most from the available software pool?\" the Boss gasps enthusiastically - not really realising that all this project is really going to achieve is the unearthing of a large portion of the worst software in history... \n\"How would that work?\" the PFY says. \n\"We'd calculate the value of the software they returned and the group that returned the most would earn a prize. And we'd also calculate the value of the software that groups bought from the pool and give a prize for that too - maybe 100 quid on the bar.\" \n\"Ah,\" the PFY says, keenly interested in the money-on-the-bar idea. \"Two lots of 100 quid. Hmmm. But in the latter example wouldn't people just buy up vast quantities of crap software from the pool to win the prize, leading to exactly the same situation as before?\" \n\"No!\" the Boss snaps, waggling a finger. \"They'd have to show a real business case - and we could verify it.\" \n\"It's not a bad idea,\" the PFY nods. \n\"I can't fault it,\" I say. \n\"I'll send the message out now,\" the Boss says, after making a few additions and modifications to the text. \n. . . Three days later . . . \n\"I can't believe it!\" the Boss burbles, wading through the piles of software clogging up Mission Control. \n\"I know,\" the PFY says. \"We could almost open our own Symantec store!\" \n\"I was thinking of applying for a Microsoft Reseller certification,\" I say from behind a mound of Vista install media. \n\"So which group's winning?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Well it was a close race,\" the PFY says. \"Because it looks like one of the Beancounters had his heart set on a Lotus Notes and Novell installation, but there was an incredibly large trunk of enough OS2 Warp install media to serve two thirds of the company - which no one's owned up to.\" \n\"So who won?\" \n\"Well...\" the PFY says. \"It was us.\" \n\"You?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Yes, well when you factor in all the Server OS, Database, ERP licenses that we traded in when we went virtual, we won by miles.\" \n\"But...\" \n\"I know, it hardly seems fair - but bear in mind that the company will now be able to use all those licenses for new services.\" \n\"I suppose you'll be wanting the 100 quid,\" the Boss sighs, admitting defeat quite quickly, really. \n\"That would do nicely,\" the PFY sniffs, as we choose that moment to break for a liquid lunch courtesy of the company. \n. . . \n\"So,\" I say, as we down the first company-funded pint. \"Any idea how we're going to get the second 100 quid?\" \n\"No idea,\" the PFY says. \"Though I did happen to make a quick call to the piracy hotline about someone running a stack of servers with no licensing earlier this morning.

A surprise dwarfed by that which awaited me when I looked up the directors of our server hosting outfit at the companies office. Telling senior management I could shave about 30 per cent off our IT spend was just the icing on the cake. Unless of course I don't get my new car - in which case it'll be close to 90 per cent...\" \n\"But that's... blackmail!\" the PFY says, looking aghast. \"Anyway, how do we know that you've not passed this information on others who'll blackmail us as well?\" \n\"I've told no one - this is between you two and me.\" \nOh dear. \n\"No one, you say?\" the PFY says. \"And I suppose you'll be wanting cash, not a cheque?\" \n\"What do you think?\" \n\"OK, OK,\" I say. \"We admit defeat. We do keep some cash in the office.\" \n\"In the tape safe,\" the PFY says, \"at the back of the office...\" \n. . . \n"}

Protected Storage experts. 24 Hr on call.\" \n\"He had someone in to open the door!\" the PFY swoons. \n\"Yes they did,\" our Boss snaps from the doorway behind us. \"I managed to reach Directory Enquiries and get an answer before my cellphone battery died – and even more unbelievably the first person I called was willing to come out to sort the problem out.

Like if it's sitting in their Junk Email folder. Until they get a message from the systems people asking them to check it for messages 'that might have got misdelivered over the break'.” \n\"There's no proof!\" \n\"Not yet - but then we're not talking court-of-law here, we're talking court-of-public-opinion. In a court of law they're looking for proof that you definitely did something, whereas in the court-of-public-opinion they're just looking for a hint that you might have done something – to fuel the rumour of you being a perverted sleaze with a fetish for enclosed spaces...\" \n\"There's no proof I sent the messages, though.\" \n\"Oh you mean like computer forensics?\" I say. \"Then you haven't seen the PFY's tools for tampering with timestamps and injecting questionable phrases and image data into unallocated regions of a hard drive. Not to mention the one for manipulating the Exchange server to insert messages at certain times – from target machines. They're works of art.

We forget all that happened last year and start afresh this year. \n\"I... suppose so,\" the Boss concedes. \n“And so I assume that you'll have to make some revisions to the statement that you no doubt made to security at the end of last year?” \n“I... Yes.” \n“Something along the lines of a terrible misunderstanding when you were feeling a little tired and emotional and that you're really sorry if you made any unfounded allegations out of jealousy and spite.” \n“I... OK.” \n“Now, perhaps?” I say, picking up the phone receiver and handing it to him \nFive minutes later the call is made. With a little bit of help from the PFY and myself the Boss manages to concoct a story to appeal to Security's neadertal intellect (ie an EastEnders episode) about a cocktail of fear, jealousy and high alcohol lager forcing him to make some rash statements that now, in the light of day, he regrets. \n“So that's it then?” the Boss says. “No fake email messages?” \n“Scout's honour. In fact, I'm feeling so good about it, I won't even keep all the crap you dropped in the bottom of the tape safe last year.” \n“Ah yes, that.

Leastways, I know it is in my case.\" \n\"So now you're saying that you have it as well?\" \n\"Absolutely - but over the years my assistant and I have evolved a clear and concise language with which to pass on instructions.

Keep a stock of it on site. Ten boxes or so, what do you think?\" \n\"Excellent idea!\" the PFY says, knowing full well that a particular cable manufacturer is offering a 16 gig USB key with every ten boxes of cable purchased. \"Or perhaps even 20 boxes - just to be on the safe side.\" \n\"Why not 30?\" the Boss bids. \n\"Or 40?\" the PFY says, upping the ante to levels which will see us needing a new storeroom. \nWhile it's good to know that the PFY is fully prepared to let the company buy a stack of purposeless cable to land a 20 quid USB stick, the Boss doesn't seem to be at all concerned... yes, eau de rodent is in the air. \n\"So,\" I say, Camp-Daviding the bidding war. \"Whose cable should we buy?\" \nAnd that's where the easy camaraderie between the PFY and the Boss comes to an end... \nThe PFY has chosen to go with the well known brand of Cat-6e warrantied cable that spans the entire building, whereas the Boss has chosen a little-known East European manufacturer whose cable warranty is measured in minutes from install. \nAn intense period of negotiation ensues where the PFY and the Boss both argue about the relative merits of their favoured cable - the Boss arguing that he can get five boxes of his cable for one box of the PFY's preferred brand, and how it makes sense to use it for infill cabling which probably wouldn't get warrantied anyway. \nIt all sounds a little... coached... for my liking. \nI look up the cable manufacturer on the old interweb only to find... nothing. Which in itself isn't a good sign. However, after a bit of perseverance and some liberal misspellings I manage to find the UK launch announcement of the manufacturer concerned, complete with the news article on their current promotion - the chance to win a flight in a Mig fighter... \nAnd now I'm torn between a rock and a hard place, to mix my metaphors into meaninglessness - if only for the alliteration. \nOne part of me wants to help the Boss win on the off-chance that the manufacturers have used some of their own cable in the control systems of the aforementioned Jet, but then the PFY does have his heart set on those USB keys - so I do have to be a bit careful... \n\"Tell you what,\" I say to the PFY. \"How about we get a couple of boxes of the Boss's stuff in just to see what it performs like and make our minds up after we've tested it?\" \n...Ten abortive deliveries later (thanks to the PFY's policy of chucking the deliveries straight into the bin)... \n\"I'm telling you, we've seen nothing!\" the Boss snaps down the phone. \"So there's no point in invoicing us for it. We won't pay!\" \n\"Cheeky buggers,\" the PFY muses, once the Boss has hung up. \"They're probably used to dealing with big companies where no one keeps track of deliveries.\" \n\"Yes,\" I say. \"A couple of boxes of cable - who's going to know if they got lost somewhere - and as it's so cheap they probably just expect we'd pay the bill without checking. We'll probably never hear from them again.\" \n\"No no,\" the Boss says. \"They're sending a couple of their sales people over right now...\" \n>DANGER WILL ROBINSON!< \n\"What's the problem?\" the PFY says as I ferret through my desk for any personal belongings, shoving them hurriedly into my bag. \nHave a quick look at the launch announcement photos on the web and tell me what you think their 'sales people' did in a former life... \n\">clickety< Uh-oh,\" the PFY mutters under his breath as he notes the collection of swarthy types that wouldn't look out of place on the cover of any of the magazines like Soldier of Fortune or KGB Quarterly . \"Perhaps we should go bin diving and get the cable back?\" \n\"Too late,\" I say, as the phone rings from the Boss's office. \"I think they're already here.\" \n\"Bugger,\" the PFY says as the Boss summons us to his office. \"I've pulled a hammy. You go, I'll try to catch you up.\" \nPathetic. \nOn getting to the Boss's office I find a vision of loveliness in place of the expected bemuscled umbrella-murderers. While the Boss scratches out a personal cheque in the hopes of winning another sort of free ride, I have a quiet word with the woman. \n\"Let's be honest,\" I murmur. \"Your cable's probably 50 per cent copper, 50 per cent copper substitute and of a standard normally seen in Christmas tree lights. If we install it in our building we're likely to see a huge impact on our network performance and a rise in user complaints - not to mention that my assistant is liable to spend the rest of his life rerunning faulty lengths of cable. I can't understand why you'd even think that an IT professional would consider your product.\" \n\"I have gift vouchers for several major curry houses, an open tab at a number of large licensed establishments and a morally casual attitude,\" she responds. \n\"So, just the 50 boxes?\" I say to the Boss moments later. \n. . . the next day . . \n\"...and then they had one of their experts work me over,\" I recount to the PFY. \n\"Ah that explains the bruises around your neck,\" the PFY says. \"The bastards! You were lucky to get out alive.\" \n\"I know,\" I shudder. \"And I promised them I'd go back tonight to... uh... explain the missing cable. But looking on the bright side, the Boss has won his jet flight and their salesperson has assured me that their maintenance policy is the bare minimum required to land at a private airfield, so fingers crossed for a subterranean landing.\" \n\"Yes, fingers crossed,\" the PFY sighs. \n"}

The former CSG employee deleted the records of more than 10,000 public servants from government systems, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage in the process. \nThe computer system disruption cost the NT Government an estimated A$1.25m ($825K) in productivity losses, and tied up 130 experts in resolving the mess. \nMcIntosh hacked into the database system using the stolen login credentials of a former colleague, who he was living with at time of the attack. The contractor carried out the attack while reportedly drunk and depressed, following the breaking-off of his engagement. \nHe pleaded guilty to 12 counts of hacking in the NT Supreme Court in January, prior to a sentencing hearing on Wednesday. In sentencing, Justice Stephen Southwood told McIntosh he \"didn't cause significant permanent harm (but) nonetheless it was malicious\" . \nThe hacker has been on remand since his arrest, and will be eligible for parole in two months.

He'll meet someone as Candice or Lord Peter and use her\/him to introduce all the other personalities, finally organising a date as Jerry.\" \n\"But who wants to meet a traffic warden?\" \n\"No one, but that's the beauty of it.

(Episode 5b) \nLadies and Gentlemen of the jury, at this juncture it falls upon me to review both the charges and their relative merits before giving direction to you, the jury, prior to your retiring to make your decision. \nCases of this magnitude garner considerable media attention and I strongly direct you not to be swayed by any speculation that may have appeared in the gutter press about the defendants' guilt in this matter. \nThe two defendants stand accused of a number of very serious charges including forgery, theft, extortion, assault, kidnapping and attempting to pervert the course of justice - to name but a few. \nThe charges of attempting to bribe Police Commander Reg Stapleton, threatening Police Commander Reg Stapleton and finally successfully bribing Police Commander Reg Stapleton have been dropped now that ex-Police Commander Reg Stapleton resides in Majorca after a lucrative... uh... gambling windfall. \nThe prosecution's contention that this windfall was orchestrated in some way by the defendants - based on a sheet of paper found at the casino containing a number of sequential keypresses apparently setting the machine in 'debug mode' and forcing consecutive jackpots to occur - is preposterous. \nIndeed, the link between the defendants and this note is extremely tenuous, and were we to condemn anyone in possession a piece of letterhead paper from the IT department of their company it would be a very sad day indeed. Who of us can honestly say they have not received such a page at one time or another? I know I have. \nAs you are no doubt aware, the four charges of arson have been withdrawn following an incident involving a carelessly placed bar heater in an evidence room. Drawing links between this incident and the access to the evidence by the aforementioned police commander are purely speculative and based upon the vaguest of suspicions and some very grainy closed circuit TV images - and should be discounted. \nSimilarly the assault and kidnapping charges may yet be withdrawn after the two incidents early this morning. If this case has cemented anything at all in our minds I would I hope that it has taught us to be more careful our footing on underground platforms when a train is approaching. \nAs regards the evidence proffered by the so-called witnesses, the prosecution would have us believe that their key witness, Mr. X, was so fearful of identification and retribution that his testimony was only obtained on the grounds that his identity was never revealed, and that for a trial to be fair that the same anonymity be extended to the members of the Jury. His testimony, if one can call it that, is typical of the feeble minded fabrications one all-too-often encounters when dealing with heads of financial departments located in corner offices with a South East view on the 4th floor of medium to large companies in this country. It would not come as a surprise to me if the man chose to recant his testimony as a drug fuelled flight of fancy in the next day or two in a fit of remorse. \nMy impression of him is that he is neither to be trusted nor relied upon - entirely the sort of individual to leave the country in the middle of a major trial on the spur of the moment for an extended holiday without telling anyone of his whereabouts and never contacting his friends or relatives again. Were he not under the protection of a single police officer with a history of narcolepsy, staying in room 203 of the Dorchester Hotel, I might seriously consider ordering the confiscation of his passport. \nAnd now a word or two about the defendants, who have conducted themselves with the decorum of the true IT professionals that they are throughout this harrowing ordeal. Whilst one might quite reasonably expect them to harbour feelings of resentment and outrage at the perjurous casserole of untruths we have been served in the past week, their composure has been a glittering example to us all of the ability of honest men to shrug off vicious slights. \nAnd finally, a few comments on the relevance of evidence on the most serious charges as they pertain to the law. Although the prosecution have proven beyond a shadow of doubt - through both DNA and fingerprint evidence - that the defendants were in the office concerned around the time of the alleged offences, they have chosen to pursue an intricate and convoluted conspiracy involving secret doors, tampered security cameras and access locks, cleaning alcohol and rolls of carpet when in fact a far simpler and more believable explanation for what transpired is blatantly obvious - though neither noted nor investigated - that of Spontaneous Human Combustion. The jury is directed to contemplate this fact in their deliberations. \nAnd so I would like to direct the jury to retire to their chamber to review the case they have seen and heard in the past few days, setting aside any external influence they may have been exposed to, and reach a unanimous verdict of not guilty. They should set aside my personal opinions and the fact that I am so sure of the defendant's innocence that I have already ordered that they be freed on bail pending an appeal - should that be necessary - and judge the case on its merits. Finally, prior to my departure for my extended Majorca holiday, I would like to thank each and every juror personally for their selfless attention during this trial. Juror number 1, Steven West, 34b Windsor Drive, Peckham, Thank you very much. Juror number 2, Sumit Singh, Apartment 2, 41 Badger Close.... ® \n"}

OK, I can see how that would happen. So you're completely broke?\" \n\"Yes!\" \n\"And you need some money?\" \n\"Yes!\" \n\"And you want me to help you get some?\" \n\"YES!\" \n\"Alright then, I suppose I can help. But it's not going to be easy - we're in a recession after all, and there's only one thing that sells in a recession...\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Fear.\" \n\"Really? The first set were OK, but FEAR 2 was pants!\" the PFY burbles. \"But I get your point - people stay at home and play more games.\" \n\"No!\" I snap. \"I mean real fear. And if our friends in the pharmaceuticals industry have taught us anything it's that you can ride out a recession on a tidal wave of fear. Fear, and a few strategically placed incidents.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Wait one moment,\" I say, making a few hasty changes to our bandwidth configs. \n. . . \n\"So?\" the PFY says five minutes later. \n\"Give it time,\" I say. \nTen minutes later... \n\"How much time?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No idea,\" I shrug. \"It's a waiting game.\" \n\"Can we wait at the pub?\" \n\"I thought you had no money!\" \n\"I don't.\" \n\"I see.\" \n. . . Later at the pub . . . \n>beep< >bippy< >beep< >bippy< >beep< >bippy< \n\"Well, that's the seventh text message and the fourth unanswered phone call,\" I say. \"I think it's time to go back.\" \n\"One more round?\" the PFY says \"You know how I hate to cut short a lunchtime.\" \n\"OK, just this one\" I say, looking at my rapidly evaporating wallet contents. \n. . . Three rounds later . . . \n\"Where the hell have you been?\" the Boss snaps. \n\"Uh, meeting with vendors,\" I ad lib. \n\"Didn't you get my messages?\" \n\"I... I guess not,\" I lie. \"We got sort of wrapped up in the presentation. Then the guy from the antivirus company was telling us about this new wave of infections they're seeing. Apparently the attack vectors are so varied it looks for all the world like someone's compromised your firewall and permitted the world to attack all your poorly protected desktop machines, which in turn leads to massive user problems and network overload!\" \n\"I don't care about that!\" the Boss snaps. \"My machine's not working and my email is taking ages to download.\" \n\"You don't think...\" the PFY gasps. \n\"That OUR site has been infected by this terrible virus?\" I gasp. \n\"I was going to say that we should go to the pub and work out what's wrong with his machine,\" the PFY says, \"but come to think of it you may have hit the nail on the head!\" \n\"A virus - but how could that possibly happen? We have a top of the line firewall device!\" the Boss says. \n\"True,\" I say \"But firewalls only really protect you from outside threats. If someone introduces the virus inside the firewall..\" \n\"But how?\" the Boss gasps. \"Don't we have that Network Admission thing installed?\" \n\"We do - but that doesn't help when a device already on the network gets infected by a device off the network.\" \n\"But how could that happen?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Very easily. We're talking about Sympathetic Access Recombinant Software - that passes from one type of device to another.\" \n\"What devices?\" \n\"My money's on portable media players and cellphones,\" I say \"Everyone has one and a lot of them have Bluetooth. A PC virus has morphed to one of them and morphed back to a PC as something new.\" \n\"So this could be a.... pandemic!\" the Boss whispers. \n\"There's no need to panic,\" I say. \"We'll get security to lock all the outside doors and screen anyone coming or going for mobile phones and mp3 players. And confiscate them. We'll collect them all and find out which ones are infected.\" \n\"But what about the infection?\" \n\"Don't worry, I think I know where we can buy a couple of hundred PC-cillin licences,\" the PFY says. \"But they'll want cash - five quid each.\" \n\"PC-Cillin?\" the Boss asks. \"Isn't that ancient? Hasn't it expired? Wasn't it free?\" \n\"All good questions, the answers to which are yes, almost and in your dreams.\" \n\"So to fix this we've got to buy some almost expired antivirus software and confiscate everyone's MP3s?\" \n\"Yes. The company may want to reimburse owners of infected devices if they turn out to be unrepairable,\" the PFY says. \nThree days and one exceptionally lucrative car boot sale later... \n\"Who could have guessed?\" I ask the Boss as I hand over some 'licences', hot off the MFD. \"Only the very newest, most expensive devices couldn't be disinfected.\" \n\"I'm sorry, but I still don't understand how on earth this could be related to someone's phone. The Director wants me to explain it to him!\" \n\"Bluetooth and 802.11 apparently,\" I say. \"I'll get the PFY to stop in and explain it to you when he gets back from the doctors.\" \n\"Nothing serious I hope?\" \n\"Nah, just something his Mexican cousin gave him after his holiday.\" \n\"Oh! Right! Well, no explanation necessary - The Director can get stuffed. Well... if anyone wants me I think I've got a bit of a cough myself and will be home for a few days. Or weeks - who can say?\" \n. . . Ten minutes later, inside the Director's office . . . \n\"...And there's absolutely no link between the current office absences and any computer virus,\" I say. \"None whatsoever - unless of course you've got one of those credit cards with a smart chip in it...\" \n"}

So what you've got to do is find a balance between rewarding them for good behaviour - like not calling you and not playing with their desktop configuration... and punishing them for bad behaviour - like calling you or playing with their desktop configuration.\" \n\"I'm not sure I follow. So what you're saying is that no one method will guarantee good users?\" \n\"Exactly. I mean you could use the stick all the time - because after all there's no Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Users. And you'd probably get reasonable results.\" \n\"But..\" the PFY prompts. \n\"But in practice you can't use the stick all the time. If you want a user to do something you must choose whether the correct method is to encourage them to do it with the carrot, or compel them to do it with the stick.\" \n\"What's the difference?\" \n\"How they feel about you at the end of the process.\" \n\"Again, what's the difference?\" \n\"Perhaps you should just give it a go - you might be surprised how users respond to a positive rather than a negative,\" I say. \n. . . An hour later . . . \n\"How did that go then - did you encourage our user to empty some of the crap out of his mailbox?\" \n\"Uh, not really. He just said we should buy bigger hard drives for the server.\" \n\"Really? How odd, I was sure he'd resp... I... You offered him a real carrot, didn't you?\" \n\"That's what you said to do!\" \n\"I meant FIGURATIVELY! A figurative carrot. Not a real carrot, but something like a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate.\" \n\"Oh I see - so not a carrot, but some other form of food.\" \n\"Something like that,\" I say. \"I'll pop down and see him and see if we can reach some amicable solution.\" \n. . . One ambulance later . . . \n\"So was that a figurative stick?\" the PFY asks. \n\"It was a fire extinguisher, so technically, yes it was.\" \n\"And how is this different from what I usually do?\" \n\"Because we tried the carrot approach - you with a carrot and me with a couple of lagers at the pub before we tried the stick approach.\" \n\"Yet neither worked,\" the PFY observes. \n\"The stick worked,\" I counter. \"His mailbox is empty.\" \n\"Only because you deleted it.\" \n\"So I used two sticks. However, the point of the exercise is not about sticks but that people can sometimes respond to the carrot - and they should be given that option!\" \n>CRASH!< \n\"What the hell happened in finance?!\" the Boss fumes. \"They say you hit someone with a fire extinguisher!\" \n\"I didn't,\" I lie. \"I was talking to one of their users about reducing the size of his mailbox when an extinguisher fell off the bracket, bounced off his desk and hit him in the head.\" \n\"The size of his mailbox! You hit someone because they wouldn't empty their mailbox\" \n\"Like I said, the extinguisher fell off the bracket, bounced off the table and hit him in the head. And his mailbox was huge - it took up 98 per cent of the mailstore and was mostly funny movies.\" \n\"Why didn't you just make the mailstore bigger?\" \n\"Because the recommended size for mailstores is...\" \n\"Who cares about the recommended size of mailstores?! Just buy bigger disks!\" \n\"Bigger disks don't help - there's plenty of space on the existing disks but the recommended size of the stores is...\" \n\"So if you've got spare disk space why don't you make another mail store?\" \n\"BECAUSE... HE'S... USING... 98 PER CENT... OF... THE... LARGEST... POSSIBLE... MAILSTORE... SIZE.\" \n\"Then just make the mailstore bigger!\" \n\"Perhaps I can help,\" the PFY says, stepping in before something really bad happens. \n\"We have a number of mailstores, all at the absolute maximum supported size. One of our users, who has been collecting video funnies for many, many years has been storing these movies in a folder in his mailbox. This mailbox has now grown so large it has pushed all the other users out of the mailstore and so we asked him nicely to remove some of the data from the mailstore and put it somewhere more appropriate - like a desktop folder or portable hard drive. He refused my request, so Simon went to show him the options available to him as far as storage goes - during which discussion the faulty bracket dropped a fire extinguisher.\" \n\"You expect me to believe you can't make a larger file!\" the Boss says. \"A bloody monkey could make a larger file...\" \n. . . \n\"Hang on,\" the PFY says, a couple of seconds of silence later. \"I've got an off the wall idea.\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"Would you like this carrot?\" \n\"What? No!\" \n\"Oh, OK, suit yourself...\" \n. . . \n>CLONG!< \n"}

It was working this morning and it's not working now.\" \n\"OK,\" the PFY says helpfully, asking the standard IT support question - \"What has changed?\" \n\"Well it's afternoon now,\" the user responds. \n\"Yes, very good, but let me rephrase the question - What, TO DO WITH YOUR MACHINE, has changed?\" \n\"Nothing.\" \n\"You've not installed something, uninstalled something, moved something, plugged something in, unplugged something, changed a setting or two?\" \n\"Nope, nothing.\" \n\"Used a different browser maybe?\" \n\"What do you mean, different browser?\" \n\"Nothing, just talking to myself,\" the PFY says, realising that he almost opened Pandora's hard drive. \"Tell you what, I'll be up to have a look at it as soon as I can.\" \nWhich is complete porkies, as evidenced by the PFY's dive back into the newspaper. \nThat's the thing about non-specific complaints about 'the system' and 'not working' - they don't motivate you. \nMoments later the phone rings again and I answer it so as not to disrupt the PFY's cartoons. \n\"Yep?\" \n\"I've got it too!\" the user at the other end of the line gasps. \n\"Canine herpes?!\" I gasp, picking two words at random from the sewer of my mind. \n\"WHAT?!\" the user gasps back. \n\"Is this not the vet?\" I reply, realising that whilst there's no motivation to get involved in user problems late on a Friday there's a rich seam of enthusiasm to be tapped when user torture is on the cards. \n\"Uh... No?\" our user says, confused \n\"Oh, my mistake - you see I was just talking to the vet about the dog that was caught in the basement and had to be put down because of its.. uh... diseases. And when you rang and said you had it too...\" \n\"I was talking about the software failures in accounts.\" \n\"Oh the java thing, not canine herpes?\" \n\"No!\" \n\"Alright then, no problems. And you don't own a dog?\" \n\"Ah... yes, but that's got nothing to do with it!\" \n\"Of course not,\" I say, clicking my way furiously through my caller's personal documents to his photos folder. \"Nothing at all. Anyway, the dog we captured was a... golden retriever with a red collar. You don't have a golden retriever with a red collar do you?\" \n\"I... Yes, but it doesn't have canine herpes.\" \n\"However would you know that?\" the PFY asks, smelling blood in the water, dropping his newspaper and jumping into the conversation. \"I mean the vet had to take a blood sample to find that out for us! What sort of person tests their dog for canine herpes?\" \n\"I didn...\" \n\"More importantly,\" I ask, pursuing the PFY's topic. \"WHY would someone be routinely testing their dog for canine herpes? I mean I assume it's routinely by the way you said No instead of Not that I know of. That was fairly definitive...\" \n\"I don't routinely test my dog for...\" \n\"So it was a one-off test then?\" the PFY interrupts \"Something made you decide to test your dog? Maybe you had a party - a few close friends, a few too many drinks - things got out of hand - we've all been there.\" \n\"Except for the dog bit,\" I add \n\"WHAT?!?! I don't know what you're talking about - I'm just calling to say I can't get the financial information ticker tape thing to play on my screen!\" \n\"Oh right!\" I say. \"So this has nothing to do with the dog in the basement?\" \n\"NO!\" \n\"Oh, right then! OK, I'll open a new job for you on the helpdesk system and it'll keep you updated. You'll get regular email updates or you can call the helpdesk if you need an urgent update.

Is that what happened to the machine I brought in two weeks back?\" \n\"No, that really was stuffed.

Fifteen minutes later . . . \n\"So what you're saying,\" the PFY says to his partnered Beancounter, is that we should relax the restrictions on the VPN so that virus-infected home machines can still connect to our network?” \n“It’s just a bit of spam...” the Beancounter says. \n. . . \n“...and so we decided to do a one-on-one trust exercise,” the PFY explains to me moments later as another beancounter is helped from the room. “He was going to lean forward and I was not going to hit him in the head with the first heavy item that came to hand. Only he leant too far forward - because he didn’t trust me - and a brick which I found in my suitcase came into contact with him.” \n”So when you look at it from a trust exercise viewpoint it was really his own fault?” I suggest. \n“Yes, I suppose you’re right.” \n“And the incident with the half brick was a by-product of us trusting them to trust us?” \n“It was a whole brick when I started, and yes, true.” \n“Tell you what,” I say, grabbing the spare half brick, “Why don’t you do some reflective listening with that chap over there who thinks we should let him send full-length movies in email while I go and talk to the one who wants us to use Gmail as the company email system.” \n. . . \n“And so in effect,” I explain to the Boss. “We trusted them too much.” \n“We thought we could trust them to trust us,” the PFY says sadly. “But they let us down.” \n“I’m not sure the facilitator would share your interpretation of events,” the Boss observes dryly. \n“Well there’s the interesting thing,” the PFY replies. “Before he slipped down those stairs he told Simon and myself that it might be beneficial for us to re-establish trust with all users who feel in some way underserviced by our expertise.” \n“So we’ve programmed the lift so that when those users swipe themselves into the lift at home time, it’ll bypass the ground floor and go straight to the basement where we’ll be waiting in the company van to do some quick trust exercises.” \n“I... don’t think that’s a very good ide...” \n“What, you don’t trust us?” the PFY asks, reaching for his brick... \n"}

They both burst out laughing. \nGood times. \nThe PFY has heard more than his fair share of Multifunction Printer repair stories in the past three days and is starting to get a little... edgy. \nI do a quick mental calculation of the PFY’s mood, judged solely by the location of his hand under the desk. Top drawer: cattle prod. Middle drawer: enhanced cattle prod. Bottom drawer: claw hammer with the fingerprint-resistant grip. \nI cough loudly and shake my head slightly as I see the bottom drawer ease open - we need this printer fixed as it’s the only one with the financial signing authority signatures loaded into secure ROM. And after all, it is pay week... \nThe PFY’s hand trembles slightly, but he pushes the drawer closed. In an effort to give him some respite, I decide to escort the engineers up to the fourth floor and handhold them today. \n“So how are we doing fellas?” I ask, keeping it casual as the lift doors close. “Any nearer to knowing what’s going wrong?” \n“Oh, printers are pretty tricky things to work out,” one of them responds condescendingly, “because they’re a mixture of hardware, firmware and software - not like your systems which are pretty much just software.” \n“Sounds technical,” I nod, hearing the faint ‘call of the hammer’ in the distance. \n“It’s often a matter of perseverance to determine the true cause of the problem,” the younger engineer explains slowly, “by determining the most likely causes of the problem and then working through the extensive diagnostic lists.” \n“So it’s not just swapping parts in and out till the problem goes away or the printer catches fire?” I ask, momentarily losing a small portion of my intended objectivity. \n“Beg pardon?” \n“Well it looked to me like you were just swapping out boards.” \n“Well I suppose to the general public it would appear to be all we do, but there’s all sorts of BIOS configurations to change,” the head engineer says. \n“From a single menu,” I point out. \n“And upgrades to apply,” the younger engineer adds. \n“From another menu...” \n“And diagnostics to examine,” the head engineer chips in. \n“From the eight LEDs on the back of the unit...” \n“Yes, but we need to diagnose against condition fault sheets.” \n“The one page chart in the back of the manual?” I add. \n“Are you suggesting this is easy?!” \n“Well... it has been three days,” I reply. “And there are two of you. And it’s not a very big manual.” \n“It’s not like a computer where you just keep restarting it till it works!” the younger engineer says defensively. \n“No, no, I wasn’t suggesting that it was!” I say, pondering how close my bank balance is to being in the red (technical lager expenses). “I’m just concerned that we get the printer up and running by 4pm today.” \n“Four pee em,” the older engineer says, in a doubtful tone. “You’re not giving us much time.” \nI hesitate to bring up the ‘three days’ thing again, but I’m starting to appreciate what the PFY has been putting up with. \n“Look,” I say, being reasonable. “How about we approach this from a logical point of view. The jammed paper has a clear image on it, but the image isn’t fused onto the page yet, which suggests that the problem is occurring somewhere between the imaging and the fusing process - so perhaps we should look to see if all the sensors are correct, the feed rollers are not slipping - that sort of thing?” \nThe two engineers smile and share a knowing glance. \n“OK,” the older one says. “I know it must look like we’re new at this game, but we’ve actually been doing it for a while and I think we’d know whether it was a simple thing like that.” \n“It’s got to be in the setup,” the younger one says. “I think we need to adjust the gear timing from the factory defaults. Put in totally new values...” \n“Won’t that make the problem a lot worse and exponentially harder to fix if it is just a sensor or feed roller thing?” \n“Trust us,” the older one smiles. \n. . . Three hours later . . . \n“Well, that is odd,” the older engineer muses, extracting a dozen pulped pages from the heart of the printer. \n“OK...” I say, massaging the vein in my forehead. “Can we move the Secure Rom into another printer and just fix this one next week?” \n“No, the ROMS are linked to the serial number of the machine - they have to be programmed at the factory.” \n“So in order for me to get paid this printer has to be working,” I say. \n“...yyyyes.” \n“Alright, out of the way!” \n. . . Two minutes of twiddling later . . . \n“Would you look at that,” the younger engineer says. “That must have torn off on the microswitch lever and blocked the sensor the whole time!” \n“So we can put it all back together then?” I ask. \n“Yeah - but...” \n“ But?? ” \n“I changed all the timing settings... and I can’t remember what the factory ones are.” \n“Can you find out - on the web or in your manual?” \n“Ummm...” \n”Phone a friend?” \n“Nah, you’re not supposed to change them, cos they’re set at the factory...” \n>beep< >beep< >beep< >beep< \n“Hello?” the PFY asks. \n“It’s me,” I say. “Hammer time!” \n"}

Those ancient 100 meg switches are all about halfway through their book-rated lives.” \n“Now we’ve done what we could about this,” I add. “My assistant here managed to back a van over a couple of boxes of them during the building move - which was quite tricky as they were being carried by the movers at the time - but we have stacks of them to replace.” \n“So in the meantime you just... manage expectations?” Graham asks, seeing a glimmer of the light. \n“Manage user expectations and actively assist in switch failure,” the PFY counters. \n“By assisting you mean?” \n“We mean backing the cage nut screws on the switch off so far that the slightest touch (by a beancounter wondering why his port speed is 10meg half duplex) will cause the switch to fall from its lofty perch.” \n“Onto the floor,” Graham nods. \n“No,” the PFY says, “onto the switch below it - with the loose cage nut screws - which falls onto the switch below it - with the loose cage screws - and so on and so on until all the switches fall...” \n“Onto the floor,” Graham nods. \n“No,” the PFY says. “onto the beancounter.

B will think that users know everything and will consult us about every little complaint or 'good idea' that gets reported to them, and C will proceed blindly, promising solutions to users' problems, whims, flights of fancy and poorly thought-out technical aspirations.\" \n\"But why do we always end up with Cs?\" laments the PFY. \n\"We must have been very bad in former lives,\" I sigh. \"Or the end of the world is so near that karma has decided to clear the backlog of crap lives.\" \n“He’s recommending we use Windows NT as our server OS because the number of new security vulnerabilities is so low!” \n“Yes, he was talking to one of the Beancounters about it yesterday,” I respond. “He was also talked into considering securing everything in our file shares with non-inherited access lists.” \n“How can someone be that stupid?” \n\"It's hard to say how it happens,\" I shrug. \"Some pundits claim that stupidity has a similar payload to that of the atom.\" \n\"You've lost me,\" the PFY says. \n\"Well, in equation E=mc^2,\" I explain, \"the vast power of the atom, which has such a tiny mass, is bolstered because of the immense value of the speed of light squared.\" \n\"Nope, nothing.\" \n\"The energy of the atom is so huge not because of the mass of the atom itself but because of the speed of light, squared,\" I go on. \"And so it is with stupidity. While IQ is extremely low, stupidity is vastly high.\" \n\"So there's an equation for that then?\" \n\"Of course - N = IQ x S^2.\" \n\"S being Stupidity. But what's N stand for?\" \n\"Nightmare.

It's stupidity++. With normal stupidity the person might occasionally experience self-doubt. With the blind version they just forge on regardless and hope that it'll be OK.\" \n\"So things are looking bad because the boss has blind stupidity?\" \n\"No, things are looking really bad because the Boss has blatant stupidity - BS, which is even worse than the blind kind - because the person knows they're probably wrong but won't back down. And we also have to bear in mind that the IT Director has bS and has always liked Windows NT - because he can ‘understand’ it...\" \n\"That can’t be good!\" \n\"No. When the blatant stupidity of the Boss meets the blind stupidity of the IT Director we're looking at N= IQ x BS^2 x IQ x bS^S, which is, as everyone knows...\" \n\"A stupidity criticality!\" the PFY gasps. \"We must do something!\" \n\"Already in motion,\" I counter. \"I've bought us some time with the administrivial 'carbon rods' of a ten page business case proposal but I’ve been working on the business equivalent of stuffing them in lead-lined drums, encasing the drums in cement and dropping them in the North Sea.\" \n“How?” the PFY asks. \n“I’ve formed a ‘Technology Committee’.” \n”Oooh!” the PFY burbles. “A strategic technology committee?” \n“Even better, a strategic technology working committee,” I smirk. \n“With an overly broad remit, ensuring they’re too busy considering things to ever reach a decision?” \n“Uh-huh, And no evaluation critera or due dates. Still, they’ll meet both regularly and often to hammer out the important stuff...” \n“The Mission Statement, the Committee Vision and the Core Values?” yelps the PFY. \n“Uh-huh,” I reply, suppressing the inevitable gag reflex. “That’ll waste six months, no problems.” \n“But there’s no guarantee they won’t come up with something in the meantime!” \n“Sure there is - I’ve loaded the committee with technical know-it-alls, each pushing their own barrow and each with their own hidden agenda.” \n“And if that doesn’t work?” \n“They meet in the private committee room with the high security,” I say. \n“The soundproof, airtight, two-way locked one on the 4th floor that’s swept for bugs every six months?” the PFY asks. \n“Yep.

I was just waiting for the security company to deliver it,” I lie. “It completely slipped my mind.” \nAt this point I figure that telling the PFY that it was an exit strategy for any eventuality - including his megalomania - might not be well received. \n“So it’ll be OK if I take this one then?” the PFY asks. \n“Of course!” I cry, faking bonhomie. “Just...” \n“Just?” \n“Just be... careful.. where you put the card. Keep it a foot or so away from any flat surface. Particularly flat surfaces with one of those fire emergency exit maps or large red X characters.” \n“Like this one?” the PFY points to the diagram on the wall beside my desk. \n“Particularly that one,” I say, deciding to tell all. “Unless you want to hear four explosive bolts simultaneously firing pieces of badly rusted reinforcing rod in place of the high tensile steel rods currently holding the one-ton slab of concrete in place in the roofspace above your desk.” \nThe PFY looks shocked. “How long’s that been there?” \n“Since the place was built.” \n“But... you let me choose my desk location!” \n“Which is why I said to be careful around any flat surface,” I respond. “I... ran out of fire exit signs.” \n“So... there’s probably a reader near my desk for a slab above your desk?” \n“Er...” \n“Only you would’ve made allowances for desks being moved around - which probably means the roofspace is riddled with slabs.” \n“It’s a possibility...” \n“And the walls riddled with readers?” \n“Again, it’s a poss...” \nAND THE GAME OF OFFICE CHESS BEGINS! \n“There might be one over here somewhere to drop a slab onto you over there,” the PFY says, waving the card dangerously close to a missing sign location. \n“Or one over here to drop one on you over there I say, moving to Queen’s Bishop 4. \n“But then you’d have built a booby trap - just in case someone found this card.” \n“I think you’re overthinking it a little,” I say, before the PFY can warn me about going against a Sicilian when death is on the line. \n“Oh, really?” the PFY says, disappointedly, just as the Boss comes back in. \n“That card please,” he snaps. “Apparently security found a card reader in a wall downstairs which doesn’t show up on the system but they think is connected to a door to the outside world immediately below this room!” \n“Really?” I say, in a tones not unlike those used to say 'Careful, those railings might be slippery'. \n“Thank you!” the Boss blurts, heading for the door. \n>ba-ba-ba-bang!< >crash-crunch< \n“How did you...” the PFY asks, glancing away from our new office footpath momentarily. \n“I didn’t.

Still, they’re highly placed in the industry - and that’s what you need to legitimise an award.” \n“See, being at the forefront of IT is a bit like having the yellow jersey in the tour-de-France,” I explain. “It’s a lot of work to get there, a lot of work to stay there and sooner or later the performance enhancing drugs - in this case the lager - will catch up with you.

My desk is laden with the remains of a couple of cellphones, a traffic warden’s ticketing machine and a half eaten tin of chilli beans which looks to have been opened with a claw hammer. \nI remember nothing. \n“Mnhhaaaa,” the PFY mumbles at me quietly as he enters mission control and wanders over to his desk. \n“Myaa,” I reply tiredly, pushing a steaming pint mug of espresso towards him. \n“What happened last night?” I ask the PFY once he’s settled. \n“Well, you remember when we left the Blue Posts?” \n“No.” \n“Do you remember going to the Blue Posts?” \n“Nope.” \n“What about before that, the White Hart?” \n“Nothing. How the hell did we get there?” \n“The reporters took us because there was live music.” \n“I don’t remember live music.” \n“It was a bloke on a piano accordion.” \n”The cruel bastards!” I sniff. “How bad was it?” \n“As far as piano accordion solos went, it ended quite well.” \n“How does a piano accordion solo end well?” \n“With a gunshot.” \n“Ah right... I seem to vaguely remember a game of golf?” \n“The game of pool, you mean.” \n*Ping!* Ah yes, I do recall thinking the green was rather elevated.” \nOur recollections are interrupted by the arrival of a beancounter at Mission Control with his keyboard. \n“I need a new keyboard.” \n“Sure,” the PFY says. “In that box over there, help yourself.” \n“There’s none in there,” he says, moments later. \n“Don’t be ridiculous, there’s dozens in there!” \n“Yes, but none like this,” he says, indicating the ‘natural’ keyboard - you know, like the ones you find in nature. \n“Yeah, we don’t have those” I sigh. \n”But I need one. Without them my arms get really achy.” \n“I’ve used the UNnatural keyboards for years and it’s not affected my arms,” I say. \n“But it affects me,” he whines. \n“Tell you what, ask your Boss to sort you out one. We can’t order them as they cost more than the standardised average value of a keyboard. One of your new beancounter policies I believe.” \n“My computer chair’s not working properly either,” he adds, changing tack slightly. \n“That’s an office supply. You’ll need to get that from your boss as well.” \n\"But my back problem’s caused by the computer. Human beings weren't made to sit in front of computers all day!\" he sniffs. \n\"Nor were they made to slouch on a sofa eating chips and watching TV all day, but I bet you managed to crack that in the weekends without problems,\" the PFY says. \n\"I can't believe you're saying that! This could end up being a workplace injury!\" \nNo that’s a workplace annoyance,” the PFY replies. “A workplace injury is when you fall down a slippery and poorly lit staircase.” \n“... Later this afternoon, \" I add. “In any case, all this H&S workplace comfort stuff is really about being a Spaz, and there's no compensation for that.\" \n\"Spaz, are we even allowed to say that?\" the PFY asks. \"It sounds a bit non-pc.\" \n\"Course we are,\" I respond. \"It's just an acronym for Special Problem Affirmative and something beginning with Z that I’ll have thought of by the time it reaches grievance proceedings. In any case, we don't spend money on SPAZs. If we did, the Beancounters would’ve used all that cash up years ago.\" \n“So you’re not going to do anything about my keyboard or my chair?” \n“I’d love to, but we really wouldn’t like to overrule the company’s new purchasing policies. By the book, us, all the way,“ the PFY answers. \n“Besides,” I say, pointing to the tangled rubbish on my desk, “I’ve got to get this firewall fixed.” \n“That’s not a firewall, that’s some mobile phones and... a... ticketing machine?” \n“No it’s a firewall,” the PFY says. \n“I can see the City of Westminster logo on the side of it! And hang on - isn’t that the CEO’s new sat phone?!!” \n*Ping!* Uh-oh. Vague memories of a crowbar incident on the 6th floor trickle through to my brain. \n“I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO!” the PFY says “I could fix your existing keyboard!” \n“Fix it?” the Beancounter says dubiously, thinking of past occasions when the PFY and I have transposed the M and N keys on all the Beancounters’ keyboards for a laugh. \n“Yes! Obviously we’d take the opportunity to add some functionality: ipod charger cable, wireless KVM capabilities. Tell you what - leave that one with us and we’ll prototype the new version for you when we finish fixing this FIREWALL. *Wink.*” \n“I... OK.” \n[30 minutes later] \n“Okay, what does it do?” I ask the PFY, when his soldering iron is back in its holster. \n“It’s a keyboard,” he replies. “The fault was a little circuit board corrosion, which was quickly fixed with a bit of fuse wire.” \n“And all the tinfoil?” \n“It’s Christmas - it’s decorative!!!” he cries \n“Oh,” I sigh. \n“AND it’s conductive!” he adds, cheering me up a little. \n“So it’s connected to Phase??!!!!” I blurt, noticing the additional cable. \n“No, to Earth,” he replies. “Otherwise it’d be dangerous.” \n“Oh,” I sigh \n“The tinfoil on the BOTTOM of the keyboard’s connected to the mains - because that’s REALLY dangerous,” the PFY adds. \n“I don’t get how it works?” \n“When they see the extra cable they’re going to get me to bash in a couple of letters to see if it’s safe - which it is, given the rubber feet. However - they moment they go to move it to a better, more ergonomic position...” \n“Ah...” \n“More like KZEERTTTAAAAAAAAAAA, I’d think.” \n. . . \nThe boredom of the next hour is punctuated only by the arrival and departure of an ambulance as, with a small *scratchy scratchy* sound, another line of the PFY’s long list of retribution is crossed off. Tired, and still a little hung-over I settle back into the office chair - liberally Christmassed up by the PFY with the leftovers from the keyboard. The quality of the job leaves a lot to be desired, as I note that the wheel of the chair is tangled up in a... \n*KZEERTTTAAAAAAAAAAA!* \n*Scratchy scratchy.* \n® \n"}

Even the Boss’s normal expression of guilty ignorance is replaced by one that could almost be mistaken for loss... \n\"Dead?\" he asks quietly. \n\"I'm afraid so,\" I respond. \n\"But... he was doing so well.\" \n\"He was, but then that dodgy life support machine switched itself off.\" \n\"I thought they replaced that?\" \n\"They did, but the new one turned itself off too.\" \n\"I know, but I thought they replaced that one too?\" \n\"They did, but the third one had the same problem. And the fourth.\" \n\"And when did it... happen?\" \n\"Last night,\" I say. \"Apparently someone turned his TV on and he... passed on... the moment the Coronation Street theme tune started. You'll be going to the funeral of course?\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Well I just assumed - you know, an employee killed in the workplace by an unreported workplace hazard. Might look a little... cold... if someone from the company didn't show. I assume you've spoken to his relatives about compensation already?\" \n\"Compensation?\" the Director blurts. \n\"Ah,\" I say \"So you're after the FRONT page of some seamy tabloid as opposed to page 7.\" \n\"I don't understand.\" \n\"You know, 'Widow shafted by cruel company' - that sort of thing.\" \n\"Simon wasn't married!\" \n\"Yes, I'm sure the tabloids will report that correctly,\" I say unconvincingly. \n\"So what do you suggest?\" \n\"That one of you talks to the next of kin while the other goes to the funeral.\" \n\"I'll do the next of kin,\" the Director blurts hastily. \"Philip - you can take the funeral.\" \n. . . Two days later . . . \n“I suppose we’d better be going then,” the Boss mutters quietly, adjusting the Windsor on his grey tie from ½ mast to ¾ windpipe. Well, I suppose we have to move on.” \n“Indeed,” I say, glancing up at the clock. “The service is at 10.” \nThe drive to the church was punctuated only by the occasional sniff from the Boss – no doubt more concerned about the possibility of a lynching thatn the departed. \n. . . Later. . . \n\"It's surprising and humbling when you realise how little you know about people,\" the Boss says as we're driving to the graveside while the rest of the masses indulge in canapés at the after-match function. \"I mean, who'd have guessed that Simon had a Doctorate in Applied Linguistics? And his annual pilgrimage to Nepal - I thought he just went to Oktoberfest. It just shows you...\" \nWhat it shows you is that a sad by-product of the one-upmanship of a group of geeks is that each tries to outdo the others at eulogy time. Luckily the speakers ran out before anyone could mention his presidency-for-life of MENSA, his tireless work on the cancellation of third world debt and his selfless patronage of the arts. \n\"It certainly does,\" I agree as we pull up at the cemetery. \"But I guess time moves on and we have to make plans for the future. Speaking of which - what are we doing about Simon's replacement?\" \n\"Oh I've put out some feelers,\" the Boss says as we trundle over to the graveside ahead of the hearse. \"I've got a couple of pals in the industry who have a couple of prospects that they think might fit in quite well.\" \n\"Really?\" I say. \"So you weren't thinking of... appointing from within.\" \n\"Gosh, no,\" the Boss says with characteristic tact. \n\"I see.\" \n. . . Half an hour later . . . \n\"Thought I might pop along after all,\" the Director says, sidling up to the grave after the mourners have departed. \"I was talking to one of his friends after the funeral - Did you know Simon was considered for the Nobel peace prize for some poetry that he wrote?\" \n\"I know,\" I say \"He was an inspiration to us all.\" \n\"I would have thought Philip would have turned up though?\" \n\"He said he'd be here but he had to go see a travel agent about something.\" \n\"So he's not hiding behind the tractor for fear of his life then?\" \n\"Backhoe.\" \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"It's a Backhoe, not a tractor.\" \n\"What's the difference?\" \n\"To you? One goes chugga chugga chugga and the other goes brrrm brrrm brrrm.\" \n\"I see,\" the Director says, not impressed, picking up a handful of dirt. \n\"Anyway,\" I say, \"time moves on and we have to make plans for the future. Speaking of which - what are we doing about Simon's replacement?\" \n\"I've rung a few people - and I think I might have found an ideal candidate.

No, quiet would be an understatement. The room seems unnaturally large and cavernous, and there's an echo that just shouldn't be there... \nI could swear I heard the words \"sleep no more\" coming from the PC speaker, but I'm sure I'm imagining it. \nMy contemplations are interrupted by two arrivals: A postcard with the words \"Hi from KiwiFoo\" crudely pasted from letters cut out of a magazine, and the Head Beancounter. The first is disconcerting, the second just annoying. \n\"Just... ah... need the building master key to get onto the roof,\" he blathers hesitantly. \n\"Interviewing for new auditors then?\" I ask. \n\"Begpardon?\" \n\"You know - the jumping game,\" I prompt. \n\"I'msorry?\" he half gasps. \n\"You know, when you get a skip full of empty cardboard boxes delivered outside the building then convince job applicants their job relies on them jumping from the second floor balcony\" \n\"Oh, you mean like a trust test - they land in the boxes?\" \n\"No, the bin's on the other side of the building.\" \n\"So why is it filled with empty boxes?\" \n\"That's where you put all the stuff in their desks. I take it they're all internal candidates?\" \n\"No, I don't need the key for that - there's just an appointment in my diary with your... uh… former supervisor in the... roof storage facility.\" \n\"Ah, right,\" I respond. \"Complain about some IT delivery last year did you?\" \n\"No?\" \n\"Park in one of the IT reserved car parks then?\" \n\"There aren't any reserved Car Parks for IT.\" \n\"Course there are. They're labelled 'Chief Financial Officer' and 'Board Members only'.\" \n\"I…\" \n\"Doesn't matter - I don't think I've ever been in the rooftop storage facility before, so let's take a look-see.\" \n\"I'm perfectly capable of...\" \n\"No, no, I insist.\" \n...15 minutes later... \n\"That's not a storage locker - it's just some tin sheds bolted together.\" \n\"True - but how about we see what my predecessor was storing in Shed Number One?\" \n>eeeee< . . . >SLAM!< \n\"Well, what's in there?\" he asks. \n\"You don't want to know!\" I gasp. \n\"Oh come on, it can't be that bad!\" \n\"See for yourself.\" >eeeee< \n\"A bunch of monitors?\" \n\"How MANY monitors?\" \n\"I... well lets see, seven wide by six deep by six high. How many's that?\" \n\"A hundred and eighty.\" \n\"That's not so many is it?\" \nThat's only one of the sheds. Shed 2 will probably have another hundred and...” >eeee< >SLAM!< \n\"What is it?\" \n\"VT52s.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"VT52s - though on the bright side there's only about 70 of them because they're twice the size of a screen. But that's not what I'm worried about.\" \n\"What are you worried about?\" \n\"CRTs are getting harder to get rid of than a scorching case of herpes - and there's only so many you can dump on the tube before they start hunting you down like a dog.\" \n\"Can't you just get a bin in?\" \n\"You can, but even they're getting picky now, what with leaky capacitors, mercury leaching etc, and dumping this many will undoubtedly require me to fill in some paperwork about safe disposal options - with some guarantee about accuracy.\" \n\"And…?\" \n\"And that's just the monitors - the VT52s are a whole other story.\" \n\"Why's that?\" \n\"Well firstly because they're probably crammed with stuff that's no longer legal to just dump and secondly because this company's never HAD any VT52s.\" \n\"So perhaps they were here already?\" \n\"No, Simon had the sheds installed.\" \n\"So how did they get up here?\" \n\"Exactly! Someone must have brought them up here, at night, one at a time, and stashed them in the sheds.\" \n\"But why?\" \n\"A poisoned chalice,\" I sigh, the penny dropping. \n\"A what?\" \n\"Does the term 'Mutually Assured Destruction' mean anything to you?\" \n\"You've lost me.\" \n\"Say you're concerned that one of your younger beancounters is going to try and nudge you out of your job. There's two ways of defending yourself - three, counting the jumping game. The first is that you increase your efficiency to such a level that no one in power would ever dream of replacing you with your subordinate, while the second - and far less exhausting - option is just to make the financials system such a pig's breakfast that your subordinate would never want to take over. Poison the chalice.\" \n\"So you're saying Simon put all this in place just to...\" \n\"Shaft me in the event of his untimely demise, yes.\" \n\"So if monitors are bad and those VT52 thingies are worse what's likely to be in the third shed?\" \n\"At this rate, probably Daleks!\" \n\"So what do we do?\" \n\"We could just shut the doors and pretend we didn't see anything, but I suspect that if you had something in your diary there'll be appointments in someone else's diary and some form of automatic whistleblower email thing about the contents of sheds 3 and 4 flying off to the media and Greenpeace in the next day or two.\" \n\"So what do we do?\" \n\"If I were you I'd order a skip full of empty boxes!\" \n\"And what are you going to do?\" \n\"Order another skip full of empty boxes - there's four shedsworth here!\" \n\"Okay, I'll meet you back here in a couple of hours,\" he says. \n. . . Two hours later . . . \n\"What is in the other sheds?\" the head beancounter says, now that he's had two hours to wonder. \n\"It's safer not to know,\" I suggest. \n\"Oh, it's locked anyway,\" he says rattling the padlock on the door. \"And the building master key doesn't fit it.\" \n\"No,\" I say, thinking furiously. \"But just for laughs, try your door key in it.\" \n\"It's the same type as the building master...\" \n\"No, I meant your home door key.\" \n\"Why would that fit the d... >snick< oh. How did that…\" >eeeee< >SLAM!< \n\"What's in there?\" I ask. \n\"You don't want to know. Or rather the company wouldn't want you to know. Documents, thousands of them, which should have been shredded. Definitely something auditors shouldn't see. OH! A poisoned chalice!\" \n\"Indeed,\" I say. \"But if it was a real poisoned chalice, by this stage there'd be a stack of Revenue and Customs agents banging down the do... >ring< >ring< Hello. Uh-huh. Okay, well if you could just get them to wait in the... oh, I see. Okay then.\" \n\"What was that?\" \n\"Security. The timing was out by a minute or two but the Revenue agents are on their way up as we speak.\" \n\"WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? \" \n\"Well I'm going to order another couple of skips but perhaps you'd like to consider the jumping game?\" \n\"What?!\" \n\"Or you could wait a couple of minutes for Revenue to break down the door?\" \n\"I...\" \n. . . \nOddly, a rational man would have chosen the bin from the company that HE had booked rather than the one from the company that I had booked. His one, full of empty cardboard boxes, rather that my bin, full of VT52s covered with several layers of cardboard... \nThat's the thing about a poison chalice - the best thing you can do is pass it on... \n"}

Large denomination, uncirculated and consecutively numbered, they're quite obviously the result of some extortion scheme that I was not a party to and for which my share of the profits had been withheld... \nBut no longer!! The old eyecrometer estimates the sheaf of 50s as being somewhere around the two thousand quid mark. \nIf that weren't enough good fortune, I notice that the CEO's brand spanking new all-bells-and-whistles laptop has just arrived and the courier didn't get a signature. BONUS!!! \nHolidays, dosh and a new media centre for home - what more could I ask for? \nThe irritatingly repetitive reminders that I need to restart after this week's OS patches have been applied wash over me, as if someone had already added the blatantly obvious \"Don't remind me any more\" checkbox to the restart prompt... \nEven the arrival of a greenhorn beancounter doesn't sully my good cheer. \n\"I've come for the new laptop,\" he says. \n\"New laptop?\" I ask, nudging the aforementioned carton under my desk. \n\"Yes, it was delivered this morning. Security said they told the guy to bring it up here.\" \n\"Here? No, I've not seen anyone. Mind you, I've been in and out of the office all day - he probably took it back with him because he'd need to get someone to sign for it.\" \n\"So you've not seen anything?\" \n\"No, but feel free to look,\" I suggest, reaching into my drawer for the overvoltage cattleprod. \n\"Nah, it's OK, it's probably been dropped off somewhere else.\" \nThe next two minutes (which ordinarily would have been scheduled for rapidly cramming the CEO's new laptop into the shredder wheelie bin prior to sneaking it down the basement car park) have stalled upon the discovery of another wadge of banknotes under the drawer above the cattleprod... \nAnd now I'm in two minds. \nOn one hand, Simon may have hidden them under my drawer knowing they would be the last place I'd look if I were searching for undisclosed profits - but on the other hand he may have intended to disclose their location to me as a form of Christmas bonus before 'accidentally' electrocuting himself on some Christmas tinsel... \nWe will never know.. \nA closer examination of the latest bundle reveals that the sequence numbers start 100 bills after the last of the first wadge, which leads me to conclude that there's at least another two bundles of notes stashed somewhere on the premises. \n. . . \n>crash< >rattle< >crash< \nTwenty minutes and an office trashing later, I have eight bundles of 50 quid notes, all but the first taped under, in or around my desk. It looks like my first guess was correct - they were put in the last place I'd look. Still, someone's loss is my gain - in this case my weekend upgrade. \nI pop them into the shredder wheelie bin along with the laptop and make my way slowly to the freight elevator, allowing myself a cheery whistle along the way... Pressing B2 and turning the key to non-stop, I contemplate my Easter shopping list. Perhaps a company gyrocopter? \nStrolling over to my vehicle I pop the boot and empty the contraband in. I've barely slammed it shut when the basement is flooded with light. \n\"There he is!\" a voice says. \n\"Beg pardon?\" I say, feigning innocence. \n\"The money in your boot,\" the Head of Security says, stepping out of the shadows. \"Yours is it?\" \n\"What money?\" I say, stalling for time. \n\"A foreign diplomat's... uh... consultancy fee. It went missing from the CEO's safe two nights ago.\" \n\"Preposterous!\" I splutter. \"This money's been on my person for a month...\" \nMy innocence plea is silenced by yet another figure stepping out of the shadows. A figure in a khaki green KiwiFoo T-Shirt... \n\"Arrest that man!\" he says, pointing at me, as the 'beancounter' breaks out a set of handcuffs. \n\"I... would like to converse with a lawyer,\" I state calmly. \n\"A good plan,\" the figure says. \"Before or after the extradition?\" \n\"Extradition?\" \n\"Yes,\" the bogus beancounter says. \"Apparently the... consultancy fee had already been handed over to the official concerned but was to be stored for safekeeping in the company's safe while the diplomat went out for an evening's... uh... entertainment. As the money has therefore been stolen from a foreign government, there's a grey area as to whether the case should be tried in this country or in the small island nation with vast mineral resources and a judicial system that favours sentencing people to many years of hard labour at its completely manual sewerage works - just for shoplifting.\" \n\"And you have no idea how long it took to find that small island nation,\" the figure in khaki shirt chuckles drily. \"Or you could opt for a plea bargain...\" \nSomething makes me think the plea bargain might change the country but perhaps not the sentence... \n"}

I make a mental note to call the School of Dangerously Experimental Medicine and see if he's made any progress with his delusions of my demise... \nSee, I'm feeling better already. \nI'm not one to bear a grudge however, and am perfectly prepared to forgive the PFY for having superconductive high-current tinsel specially made just to secure a promotion. After all, it's his attention to detail that makes him so valuable in his role. \nThat said, I can't afford to spend my days looking behind me checking for the inevitable black van of doom. \nBecause that's a beancounter's job. \nSpeaking of which, the company beancounters have scheduled a meeting with me to emit some piffle about my wrongful acceptance of the company's accident compensation payments and spending it on an overseas holiday. They want me to pay the money back! \nHonestly - you'd think they were upset I wasn't dead - a point I noted in my response to them in my last email. And recorded their subsequent office conversation about via the CCTV system. (You never know when you'll need a bargaining chip like that at a later date.) \nOne of the weedier beancounters waxed lyrical about what he'd do with me if he ever caught me alone in a dark alley. And nothing sexual either, thankfully. Which just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. \n. . . \nI run my eye over the office just to make sure everything is as I expect it. The entrails of the PFY's chair are scattered over his desk in the wake of the frenzied search by Security for the remaining company bribe money that the PFY is supposed to have stolen. Ironically the search operation provided me with the opportunity I needed to stash the missing quiddage in the ceiling space of Security's office.. \nThere's something about well-oiled plans. And well-oiled supermodels for that matter... \nSadly though, I know I'm going to have to bury the metaphorical hatchet and release the PFY from his medical accommodation, if only because I now see the pointlessness in being a cruel and heartless megalomaniac IT professional. Sorry, I meant a cruel and heartless megalomaniac IT professional with no one to brag to or compete with. \nFor instance he'd have appreciated the way I replaced the two AA batteries in the cattleprod with a lantern battery on an extension lead because the beancounters are too tight to let us have our own supplies cupboard any more. \nA deeper man might ponder the strange adversarial yet symbiotic relationships that are forged in the darkened pits of a workplace and how they grow via shared experience to form the basis of a compartmentalised outlook on the world which is completely separate from that which we have at home. \nBut me, I just want to show the PFY how if you reduce the unlatch\/relatch time to fractions of a second on an electronic mortise lock in combination with randomising the time between card swipe and unlatch to a value between one and 120 seconds you can make one of the HR people pack a complete spaz outside the front doors of the building. (Because you never know when you're going to need a bargaining chip like that either.) \nSigh. \nAs the building starts to shut down for the night I hail a cab and give the cabbie the directions to the PFY's hospital. \n\"but I'll need to make a stop on the way,\" I add. \n. . . 10 minutes later . . . \n>clip< >clop< >clip< >clop< >clip< \n\"Oh!

Are you really from the Make-A-Wish Foundation?\" \n\"Nah!\" >KZZZZZEEERT!< \n. . . 10 minutes later . . . \n\"Picking up or dropping off?\" the charming lady at the hospital asks me. \n\"Both actually,\" I respond. \"You've cured a friend only his brother is far more delusional - thinks he's an accountant in a large company in the city. Apparently he's built up a bit of immunity to ECT. You have to set the knob to 11. Write that down, '11'...\" \n... \n"}

I’m as likely to get workplace trauma counselling as the next guy – especially when the company’s tame shrink is an ancient old boiler who was probably there when time was invented. Still, as luck would have it she fell to her death from her slippers a couple of weeks back and the company was forced to contract in an updated model... \nWhich brings us to the new company counsellor, an attractive young thing who seems genuinely interested in the welfare of staff who’ve suffered workplace injuries - and as the company schedules four free sessions for near death experiences, I book myself in. \nArriving five minutes early gives me a chance to look over her newly furnished ground floor office, situated right alongside the security office - which I’m sure is just a coincidence. \nThe first thing I notice is the gold plated electrical contacts on the arms of the reclining chair which either mean there’s a lie\/stress detector built into it or there’s an action replay of my Christmas recharge in the offing. Either way I decide that honesty is probably the best option. \n. . . \n“So,” she says, once I’ve settled in and told her about the PFY’s Christmas surprise, “You seem remarkably calm about the whole thing.” \n“Well, it’s sort of expected in our line of work.

I’ve invested so much time in educating my assistant in his chosen profession that it was inevitable that he’d seek advancement through dead man’s shoes – or in this case dead man’s smoked out automatic office chair. And trapping me is just proof of how good he's become.” \n“And you in turn extracted a modicum of revenge in getting him booked in for a couple of weeks of dubious experimental psychiatric attention?” \n“Sure. While I respect his ruthless quest for advancement I also must temper his ambition with the fear of reprisal - or I’d be forever looking over my shoulder. \nAnd this fear should be just sufficient enough to give him a moment of pause?” \n\"Indeed.\" \n“And you don’t fear that this would simply set off a chain reaction of ever increasing reprisals?” \n“No, no - you see at the end of the day we still have to work together in between reprisal attempts, so the magnitude of reprisals tends to diminish fairly rapidly.” \n“It peters out?” \n“Yes, this morning for instance. It was the PFY’s first day back so I would have been a fool to ingest any food or drink offered to me by him.” \n“Because?” \n“Because it would most likely be laced with Viagra, rat poison or horse laxative. Or all three for a really fun party.” \n“And?” \n“And in the end it was just the horse laxative.” \n“Horse laxative – how did you know?” \n“Oh, I passed the mochachino on to the Boss – the poor bastard was locked in the bog till the vet came. He was on a saline drip for half the morning to get his fluid levels back up.” \n“That was a little cruel of you don’t you think?” \n“No, cruel was shouting him two rounds of chili bhajis and a chicken vindaloo last night, as a 'Welcome to the Company' event.” \n“I see. You seem quite proud of that?” she says, disapprovingly. \n“Yes, well...” I burble. \n“And you think that will be the end of the revenge?” \n“Of course not. But in a week or so we should be back to normal.” \n“And in the meantime? \n“In the meantime I expect the PFY's tampered with the brakes and accelerator on my car so that touching either increases the speed exponentially. It’s what I would do.” \n“And yet you don’t seem at all concerned about that. Why's that?” \n“Oh, because I lent the Boss my car five minutes ago so he could get home after his morning’s illness.” \n“You what?!” \n“Oh please, don’t worry! I’m not a complete monster! I made sure he was one of the named parties on the insurance” \n“You didn’t warn him!?” \n“No, I was rather busy this morning. In any case I…” \nMy monologue is interrupted by the unmistakable sound of a car accelerating madly in the floor below us… \n“Is that...” she gasps. \n“Yes, I’d recognise that exhaust anywhere. That’ll be the PFY off on an unexpectedly fast circuit around the parking basement in his car.” \n“In his car?” \n“Yes, like I said, I was busy this morning. Working on tempering the PFY’s ambition. Remember when I said it was what I'd do? As it happened it'd what I did do.” \n“But that would mean…” \n“Wait! I interrupt, holding up a finger as a second set of squealing tyres can be heard below us - “Now that would be my vehicle. Wonder who’ll make it to the exit first??” \n“You’re a... a...” \n“I know,” I nod gravely. “A ruthless IT professional who can address both the needs of the moment and the bigger picture. One for whom the mysteries of the future unfurl as if by magic. Our future for instance. Perhaps you’ve got time for a quick after-work drink? Maybe a bite to eat. I know a place that does a cracking chili bhaji...” \n"}

But that's not all - about ten other machines in the building were damaged the same way in the past 24 hours! \nBOSS \nAny idea why they'd do it? \nPFY \nNo. \nBOSS \nOr why they'd all choose to do it on the same day? \nPFY \nNone whatsoever. \nINT: PUB \n[caption: 'Last Friday night'] \nThe PFY, very much the worse for wear, is at the bar. Beside him is a BEANCOUNTER, looking nervous. \nPFY (shouting, slurred) \nI'M TELLING YOU, JUST PUSH IT OFF YOUR DESK! NO ONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE! EVEN IF THEY SEE YOU DO IT, NO ONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE IT WAS DELIBERATE! \nBEANCOUNTER \nYes, well, thank you, I suppose, I'll certainly... \nINT: BOSS'S OFFICE \nPFY (blankly) \nNope. No idea at all. \nINT: PUB \nPFY \nJUST DO IT! LIKE THE SHOES! JUST PUSH THE MACHINE OFF THE DESK! HONESTLY, NO ONE REALLY THINKS YOU'D DO IT.

The PFY addresses them. \nPFY \nOK, so the first thing we’re going to get you to do is to take the covers off your machines. So make sure that your machine is orientated so that the serial ports are at the lowest point... \nBEANCOUNTER \nWhat’s a serial port? \nThe PFY sighs deeply. \n[Fade to 10 minutes later] \nPFY \nOK, so we’ve now found the serial ports on everyone’s machines and started undoing the screws holding the top panel in. We’ve also discovered the screws holding the power supply in, the nuts holding the serial port in, and one of you managed to undo two of the screws holding your desk together. So we’re making progress. Now, before we take the top panel off, what should we do? \nBEANCOUNTER \nDraw an arrow on the lid to show which way it goes back on again. \nPFY \nOr we could just remember sticky label is at the front? \nBEANCOUNTER \nOh. \nPFY \nAnything else? \nBEANCOUNTER \nAh... \nPFY \nYes? \nBEANCOUNTER \nEr... protect the machine from static electricity? \nPFY \nVery good – if your intention was to make sure that your machine was able to be repaired. If, however, your intention was to make your machine unrepairable we probably wouldn’t do that. We also wouldn’t make sure that the voltage selector was on 240 and not accidentally set to 115 – for those of you with a power supply with a switch on it. Anything else we wouldn’t do? \nBEANCOUNTER \nWe... wouldn’t not spill liquids inside the machine. \nSECOND BEANCOUNTER (excitedly) \nWe wouldn’t drop it on the floor again?!! \nPFY \nThat’s right, we wouldn’t not drop it on the floor again. Only this time you need to all do it at the same time so that it doesn’t look orchestrated. \nTHIRD BEANCOUNTER \nBut if we all do it at the same time wouldn’t it look even more like it were orchestrated? \nPFY \nOrdinarily, yes – which is why I brought this with me... \nThe PFY opens a small box and removes a roll of uninsulated copper wire. \nINT: CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MEETING ROOM \nSuddenly the building lights go out and the battery power EXIT lamp light in the hallway illuminates.

That's an email worth reading.\" \n\"I... But I need to keep my email,\" the PR droid sniffs, deciding on repetition as an approach. \n\"Look. I don't care if you keep every email you ever send or receive - so long as they're not clogging up the mail store. And trust me, you're clogging up the mail store. You've only been here six months and already you're the second highest mail user with 17 gigabytes of mail\" \n\"Is that a lot?\" \nUh-huh. \n\"So if I'm the second highest, who's the highest?\" \n\"Administrator - but that doesn't count because no one reads that mail.\" \n\"So it's not that much of a problem?\" \n\"It is - and I'm implementing auto archiving.\" \n\"Auto archiving? Have you gotten a green light from management for that?\" he asks. \n\"Sent the memo yesterday,\" I say. \"Rang legal this morning and they're OK with it so long as we don't lose your highly valuable lunch appointment conversations.\" \n\"But... I need my email.\" \n\"And you shall have it - only it'll be stored in an offline file and not in the mail store.\" \n\"So I'll still be able to read it?\" \n\"Absolutely! Six months from now you'll be able to open your mail archive file and find out you had a sandwich yesterday. Because she's right - you always choose the sandwich place.\" \n. . . \n\"That was surprisingly painless,\" the PFY says, moments later when the PR droid has left. \"I thought he'd put up more of a fight.\" \n\"Yes, the key with users is to...\" \nI pause as the PFY looks up in response to the opening of the door. \n\"Hi, Kathy, Projects Office,\" she says, extending her hand. \"I'm here about the archiving project.\" \n\"What archiving project?\" I ask. \n\"The one to archive email messages?\" \n\"That's not a project - in fact it's done. I clicked a couple of boxes, tweaked a few settings and it'll all happen like clockwork Monday morning\" . \n\"I didn't see a project plan,\" she says with just a hint of annoyance. \n\"No you wouldn't have - because as I said, it wasn't a project.\" \n\"It most certainly is! Did you do a risk analysis?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"A costs benefits analysis?\" \n\"Nope.\" \n\"A communications plan?\" \n\"Not one of those, no.\" \n\"Contingency plan?\" \n\"Nup!\" \n\"Work plan schedule?\" \n\"Uh... no.\" \n\"Review process?\" \n\"Afraid not.\" \n\"Resource scheduling plan?\" \n\"Nnnnno.\" \n\"Well you can't do it then! You can't do a project this risky if you haven't done the planning!\" \n\"We don't know how risky it is - we didn't do the risk analysis, remember?\" \n\"But you can't create a project plan until you've done a risk analysis!\" \n\"That's OK because we didn't create a project plan.\" \n\"You can't have a project without a project plan!\" \n\"It's not a project!\" \n\"You're right it's not a project! I'm vetoing the change process until such time as a project plan is submitted!!\" she snaps. \n\"We don't have a change process.\" \n\"Then get one - and a project plan!\" she says, storming off to the Director's office. \n\"She was a bit volume 11 wasn't she?\" the PFY says. \n\"Yeah - the projects office is pretty much staffed by those people who couldn't get into the workplace safety industry because they're too petty - so they spend their time trolling office gossip for the hint of some project they can insinuate themselves into and ride to a successful completion - albeit three weeks late because of the tangle of bureaucracy they bring with them.\" \n\"So what do we do - do a project plan or tell her to get stuffed?\" \n\"It's a tricky question. On one hand we want to be good corporate citizens and on the other we don't want to show any sign of weakness or we'll end up having to fill out a change request form just to login of a morning. Bear in mind that these are the sorts of people whose sense of achievement is measured in reams of paper and time wasted.\" \n\"So what do we do?\" \n\"Ordinarily we would give all the impression of complying with their requirements - printing boxes of documentation, revising specs, researching risks, scheduling resources and such.\" \n\"!!\" \n\"Worry not. I have a project plan I used once or twice in the past that I'm sure I can tailor for this occasion...\" \n. . . \n\"It's a little thin isn't it?\" Kathy asks, fingering the folder with disdain the next morning. \n\"Yes well, I look upon good project planning as establishing a broad framework from which to address the key strategic areas underpinning the successful completion of a holistic organisational change,\" I say, pausing briefly to fight back the nausea. \n\"Well, let's have a look at it then,\" she says. \"Implementation plan: Click the mouse button on the ON radio button then click OK. Contingency plan: Click the mouse button on the OFF checkbox and Click on OK. You can't be serious?!\" \n\"Of course I am - but read on, we did the analyses!\" \n\"Risk Analysis. Issue 1, Contingency Plan A, Risk 0. Issue 2, Contingency Plan B, Risk 0. Issue 3, Contingency Plan C, Risk 0. Issue 4, Contingency plan D, Risk 0... This is just rubbish!\" \n\"No it's not, I identified four issues and four contingency plans which quantified the risk like you wanted.\" \n\"What issues?\" \n\"Risks.\" \n\"Yes, but what were the risks?\" \n\"You mean what were the actual things I was worried about?\" \n\"Yes!\" \n\"Oh. I forget.\" \n\"And the contingency plans?\" \n\"I don't recall the exact details.\" \n\"You...\" \n\"But I have got a copy of them. In my car. I'll pop down to the basement later on this morning and get them for you.\" \n\"How about we all pop down right now?\" Kathy asks, scenting blood. \n\"I... suppose we could.\" \n. . . one lift ride later. . . \n>slam< \n\"So here's the risk profile document,\" I say, handing over a page with four bullet-pointed paragraphs in six point Times Roman associated text. \"And the contingency plans.\" \n\"I can't read it in this light, it could be anything!\" Kathy snaps. \n\"Why don't we pop upstairs where the light's better?\" I suggest. \n\"Why don't we stay down here and find a room with some lights,\" she says with a touch of sarcasm. \"In case you grabbed the wrong document 'by accident'.\" \n\"I'm sure it's the right document,\" I say, passing the pages to the PFY to check. \"Anyway, there's nowhere down here to read it.\" \n\"What about this room?\" she asks, indicating a well-lit plant room with an open door. \n\"If you must,\" I say. \n>SLAM!< \n\"Risk 1,\" the PFY reads from the light of the EXIT sign. \"A lifetime of filling out meaningless paperwork to appease some glory-hogging control freak.

Oh yeah - Risk 0.\" \n>thump< >thump< >thump< >thump< \n\"Risk 2,\" the PFY continues. \"The sound of thumping on the door...\" \n. . . ten minutes later in Mission Control. . . \n\"Risk 4.

The truth was revealed a couple of days ago. \n\"Look what I scored!\" the PFY says. \n\"Some... lift control panels?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah, they're renovating the building down the street and I noticed these were going to be chucked out.\" \n\"They were in the bin?\" \n\"Not exactly.\" \n\"In a wheelbarrow destined for the bin?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"On the floor outside the lifts?\" \n\"Ah...\" \n\"In the lift, with the power connected, in the building which isn't being renovated?\" \n\"Well, yes. But I was thinking, we could swap these with our panels and then use the extra buttons for special controls.\" \n\"Special controls like?\" \n\"Well, you press the 8th floor button, it delivers you to the ground floor and sends a text message to the Indian down the street to order two chicken vindaloos, some chilli bhajis, a couple of garlic naans and four Kingfishers.\" \n\"But wouldn't that mean that they'd be inundated with orders every time idiot tested the button?\" \n\"You'd think so, but then it would only be active outside of work hours.\" \n\"After 4pm, except on Fridays, when it's on after 12pm.\" \n\"Yes, well, I might need to think about that one a little.\" \n\"So we'd just use the lift control panel as a form of ordering system?\" \n\"Not necessarily. Press floor 9 and it'll take you to whatever floor the hottest woman in the building is on.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Of course not. It doesn't do that - but it could do if you thought it was a good idea.\" \n\"And Floor 10?\" \n\"The floor 10 button would take you up and down in the lift randomly for 15 minutes - without opening the doors or stopping at floors. At variable speeds.\" \n\"11?\" \n\"The same as 9, but for 30 minutes.\" \n\"And don't tell me, 12 is for an hour. So if you pressed 12 and 9 it would be one hour, 15 minutes of lift joyriding?\" \n\"No, 12 will gas you with a vapourised version of rohypnol before taking you to Basement 1 - where the creepy Courier Guy parks his van. You know, the one with the tinted windows. I like the binary addition of button travel times idea though.\" \n\"Gassing them and dropping them off in the basement's a little cruel don't you think?\" \n\"No, cruel's dropping the ceiling tile with 'all you can eat' written on the back of it onto the lift floor.\" \n\"Ah, yes, Rule 2, the double tap... You've given this a lot of thought haven't you?\" \n\"It passes the time between pub visits,\" the PFY nods. \n\"And it only works when it's enabled?\" \n\"When it's enabled or when you press the floor number with the DOOR OPEN button held down. I thought we could use it like a shift key - that way all the other buttons could do something special too.\" \n... \n\"Well, I gave them a call and get the lifts fixed properly as I was stuck in there for quarter of an hour this morning,\" the Boss says. \"But they say they don't know anything about the panels.\" \n\"Really? Must be a different crew. Did you speak to anyone else about this?\" \nCrap Segue Tip: If anyone, anytime - even if you're not in a movie - says \"did you speak to anyone else about this?\" say 'yes'. \n\"No, not yet.\" \n... half an hour later... \n\"Has anyone seen Jerry?\" the IT Director asks, looking around for the Boss. \n\"Haven't seen him all day,\" the PFY responds. \nCrap Segue followup: Told you so. \n\"Oh. Only there's a couple of people at reception who've got a meeting scheduled with him. Some chaps who do cloud computing - whatever that is. Sounds like something we should be looking into though.\" \n\"You know, I think I saw him on the 7th floor.\" the PFY says. \n\"Does this building have a 7th floor?\" \n\"Yes, it's just some sort of optical illusion that makes the building seem smaller.\" \n\"OK, I'll send them up there then.\" \n\"No, you need to have a company swipe card to get access.\" \n\"OK I'll take them up.\" \n\"Good idea,\" the PFY says. \n. . . \n\"7th floor?\" I ask as soon as the Boss leaves. \n\"Same as 12 but it also sends a text message to the courier to say his packages are ready and bring the big van...\" \n\"It's still... I dunno... a little cruel,\" I say. \n\"What about if I text him and tell him if he's not on 7 he'll be on 8?\" \n\"And we'll pop down for a quick ruby? OK then, you talked me into it...\" \n"}

I’m not sure. Have you tried closing down Outlook and restarting it?” the PFY responds. \n“Yes.” \n“What about restarting it in Safe Mode?” \n“I tried that,” the user says – a little too quickly. \n“Well, what about starting it in comms recovery mode?” \n“I tried that as well.” \n“There isn’t a comms recovery mode – I just made that up,” the PFY says. \n“Oh, I thought you meant –“ \n“Yeah, don’t bother,” the PFY interrupts drily. \n“But I...” \n“Let’s just see what we can see,” the PFY says, tapping away at his keyboard. \n. . . \n“So what can you see?” the user asks a couple of minutes of silence later. \n“Oh, are you still on the phone?” the PFY asks \n“Yes.” \n“Oh right then, I thought you’d wait for me to get back to you, but this works too.” \n“So do you see anything?” \n“Yes, Fear 3 is due to release in late October!!!” \n“About my email?!” \n“Oh yes, of course. Well I’ll have to do a little bit of tinkering so I’ll tell you what. Why don’t you look at your screen blankly whilst telling all your co-workers that email is down and then call me every five minutes to see how it’s going – that usually speeds up the process” \n“I..” \n“Was planning to do that anyway? I know,” the PFY interrupts. \n“But I...” \n“Was also planning to do nothing else for the rest of the morning because you couldn’t possibly do any other work until your email is working? Yes, we know that too,” I add. \n“I'm...” \n“But I’ll tell you what, can you answer a few questions. Have you moved your machine recently?” \n“Uh... no.” \n“You do realise we have voice stress analysis software monitoring our phone lines?” the PFY lies. \n“Beg pardon?” \n“Voice stress analysis software,” the PFY says. “It measures stress levels in the conversation and pretty much tells us if you’re lying.” \n“I don’t think so.” \n“The software says you do. It also says you were lying about starting Outlook in safe mode, comms recovery mode, whatever excuse you were going to use for lying about comms recovery mode and about moving your machine. Was there anything else you were planning to lie to us about?” \n“No.” \n“Oooh, software says 'inconclusive'.” \n“Look, this is ridiculous – I know you don’t have any such software!” \n“Then you won’t mind answering a couple more questions. Have you ever pictured another man naked – a friend, colleague or co-worker?” \n“No!” \n“Software says 78 per cent confidence you’re lying.” \n“I haven’t!” \n“98 per cent confidence you’re telling porkies, but let’s just leave that aside for now. Have you ever – even for a moment – considered bestiality?” \n“WHAT! NO!” \n“87 per cent confidence you’re lying – although because of the accusatory nature of our discussion we can expect you to have a higher voice stress reading than normal. So probably only 85 per cent likelihood you’re a Farmer Sutra fan.” \n“I AM NOT!!” \n“Still 87 per cent. See, the problem with this software is very black and white, you’re lying or you’re not – not about whether you’re actually a raving perv. So you’re registering 87 per cent because you probably, for a fleeting instant wondered what a workmate looked like in the flesh or what people see as being erotic in the animal kingdom. The problem is that in covering this minor thought up you’re actually lying – which registers in your mind, in your voice and on the software. \nThe user is quiet. I continue. \nSo what you should be saying is that the thought did cross your mind because then the voice stress analysis software would see that you were telling the truth - as opposed to being a complete closet case. Then you might say that you have no sexual interest in animals or your male co-workers, which would also register as being the truth.” \n“So that would prove that it was just a fleeting thought?” our user sighs. \n“Exactly.” \n“I see. Well in that case, YES, I did once very briefly picture one of my male colleagues with no clothes on and have wondered about how people could possibly consider bestiality, BUT...” \n“No, it’s reading inconclusive. I think you’re trying to put too many boundaries on it which blur your mind’s view of the truth. Like when you tell someone you’re going to go for a five mile jog every day when you know that you won’t – your mind knows it’s a lie because in the future it might not be the truth.” \n“I see – I’ve got it now. So. I occasionally think about my male colleagues naked and consider bestiality.” \n“Excellent.” \n“HOWEVER, I do not find either to be sexually arousing to me.” \n“Software says you’re telling the truth.” \n“Is there really any software?” \n“Indeed there is. We got it as a free upgrade to our voice recording software.” \n“Voice recording software? \n“Yes. We didn’t get around to installing the voice stress stuff but we did put the voice recording stuff in. So unless you want us to email a soundbite to your HR and your work colleagues I’d suggest you put your machine back where it was, get on with your work and resolve not try to bullshit a bullshitter.” \n“Ah. \nA moment of silence. \nOK.” \n“That was quite rewarding!” the PFY says. \n“Yes, but not quite as rewarding as changing his voicemail message to one of a more confessional nature...” \n“Ooh yeah, you’re right,” the PFY says, firing up the phone admin client... \n"}

It can interface directly with the lift to access all floors. It has some logic.” \n“Logic” the PFY says, scratching his jaw thoughtfully. “I think I’ve heard of that. So what sort of weaponry will it have? Some sort of Sidearm, A Taser, Billy Club?” \n“It will be unarmed,” the Boss responds, rallying as he sees the disappointment on our faces. “But it does have a full 360 degree camera.” \n“Yes, wouldn’t want to face a crim with a crowbar without a 360 degree camera,” the PFY says drily. “So what do we need this robot for anyway?” \n“There’s been a spate of thefts from the executive rooms.” \n“Thefts? You mean laptops, papers?!” I ask \n“The nature of the thefts is inconsequential – the point is that someone’s stealing things and we need to get to the bottom of it.” \n“What’s being stolen exactly?” \n“Well...” the Boss says, before realising he’s going to have to come clean “>sigh< Chocolates, some demerara sugar sachets, the fancy teabags from the wooden presentation case in the board room...” \n“Morning tea supplies?! We’re spending... How much are we spending?” \n“That’s immaterial.” \n“How much?” \n“Seventeen thousand, three hundred pounds.” \n“SEVENTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS!!! TO PROTECT MORNING TEA SUPPLIES!!! YOU COULD BUY THEM NEW MORNING TEA SUPPLIES EVERY WEEK AND STILL NOT WASTE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS! YOU COULD PAY SOMEONE TO WATCH THEM OVERNIGHT AND STILL NOT WASTE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS! YOU COULD BUY A BLOODY SAFE TO KEEP THEM IN!! YOU COULD USE THE SAFE THAT’S ALREADY IN THE BOARDROOM!!!” \n“Yes, but this way we get to catch the culprit and prevent crime.” \n“And how is it going to catch the culprit exactly?” \n“On camera.” \n“I see. And it will probably also catch the culprit reaching into his pocket for a screwdriver – moments before the camera goes blank and the hard drive containing the damning footage is removed?” \n“Ah ha!” The Boss smirks. “This unit has a strong box in it which can’t be opened. And it also has evasion logic.” \n“More logic,” the PFY says “Sounds pretty sneaky.” \n“It is,” the Boss nods. “It learns about its environment and can pass the knowledge on to other units.” \n“Other units?” \n“Oh yes! This one is a prototype, but if it works we’ll add another two to cover the building more thoroughly.” \n“So the IT budget is going to be spending three times 17 thousand pounds?!” I gasp. \n“Of course not. The first one is seventeen thousand pounds but the subsequent models will only be fifteen.” \n“Ah well, that’s alright then!” the PFY says. \n... D-Day Arrives ... \n“And I now declare this robot... er... open” the Head of Security says, pushing a button on his remote control, bringing the unit to life. \nAs the PFY, Boss and I look on, a small and somewhat anticlimatic green light starts glowing and the robot makes its way out of the Security offices. \n“It’s programmed to go from floor to floor repeatedly over the course of an evening, recording what it sees as it goes.” \n“All floors?” the PFY asks. \n“All the office floors yes – not B1 and B2. But from floor six to ground, then back up to six, reporting to the security offices each time it gets to ground.” \n“Seems feasible I suppose,” the PFY admits grudgingly. \n. . . Later that evening. . . \n“And here it comes,” the PFY says quietly as the robot cruises smoothly past. \n>whirrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRR< \n“Yes. A bit of a design flaw – a 360 degree camera that doesn’t take in views above the robot,” I say, from my position beside the PFY in the ceiling space next to the lift. \nThe PFY hushes me, nodding at the robot as it presses the lift call button. \n>PING!< \n>whirrrrrrr...< ... \n“>PING< ... >TING< ... >t-tang< ... >tink< ....... >CRASH!<” \n“So, no ‘logic’ to check that a lift’s actually there when the lift doors open then?” the PFY asks disappointedly. \n“No, but look on the bright side – with the 360 degree camera we’ve just saved the company a couple of hundred quid on the annual lift-shaft safety survey...” \n“If we weren’t going to push the boardroom safe down there after it...” the PFY says. \n“Good point. So just 17 grand down the crapper then. Ah well!” \n"}

It had hands!?” \n“Well, its claw then!” \n“IT’S GOT A CLAW!?” \n“WHATEVER THE THING IS COMING OUT THE SIDE OF IT!” \n“It didn’t have anything coming out of the side of it,” I point out. \n“IT DOES NOW, AND IT’S HOLDING A CIRCULAR SAW!!” the Boss snaps. \n“Tell us more about the bit where you were almost killed,” the PFY says, masking his deep concern for the Boss’ welfare by reaching for some peanuts. \n“It came at me the moment I stepped out of the lift!” the Boss shudders. “And it would have had me too, if the extension lead on the circular saw hadn’t got tangled around a desk...” \n. . . \n“I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR PETROL POWERED CHAINSAW!” I tell the PFY once he’s back from driving the Boss to his workplace trauma counselling sessions. \n“HE’D HAVE HEARD IT A MILE AWAY!!” the PFY retorts. “Besides, we would have had to add another arm to the robot so that it could start the thing.” \n“I suppose,” I admit grudgingly. \n“He bought the story about it going insane after a fall down the lift shaft though,” the PFY says. “How did they catch it in the end?” \n“They didn’t - Security rescued it and then it chased them round the building a bit before it fell down the staircase.” \n“Ah – which would be why they bought the story so quickly.” \n“Indeed,” I concur. “And the good news is that the Beancounters have stopped payment and returned the unopened robots to the bot company along with a bill for the damages...” \n“Ah. That might cause some... problems,” the PFY says. \n“You mean when they tell our company that a fall down a staircase can’t make a robot spontaneously sprout an arm and a chainsaw?” \n“Or make massive changes to its ROM so that it becomes a hunter\/killer...” \n“Yes, it could be a little awkward – or rather it would have been if I hadn’t taken the opportunity to swap the original circular saw for a battery powered one that can operate from the Robot’s supply. If nothing else it might lower the numbers of support staff...” \n“Oooh yes,” the PFY says, rubbing his chin enthusiastically. “The bot company is all on a single level isn’t it...” \n. . A few days later . . . \n“So the robot company has overhauled the faulty unit and think they’ve found the problem,” the Boss says. \n“Really – what did they think it was?” the PFY says innocently. \n“A... loose wire,” the Boss says, looking at a delivery sheet. “Yes, a loose wire in the... GPS circuit...” \n“...caused it to grow an arm and a saw?!” the PFY says incredulously. \n“Apparently so,” the Boss shrugs. “I think they said it was a... ‘Known bug’.” \n“Really?” I say, faking nonchalance. \n. . . \n“A KNOWN BUG?” the PFY says, as the crate is delivered to Mission Control moments later. \n“Yeah, they must really want payment and a happy demonstration site!” I say, levering open the crate. \n“A pity really” the PFY says, firing up his program editor and reaching for the box of antipersonnel equipment. \n... Two days later... \n“Another known bug they’ve ironed out,” the Boss says, wheeling another crate out of the lift. “Happens when the thing has a low battery - it can start firing ball bearings at high speed from ankle height. They even said it started doing it when it got to their office, shot out their front window and their photocopier. Surprising really, because you said you were going to charge it before you shipped it back?” \n“Yes, it is surprising,” the PFY pinocchios. \n“Still, they think they’ve nailed it this time...” \n... Ten minutes later... \n“Security screws,” the PFY says, examining the panels on the robot. “I think they might be on to us.” \n“Yes, because when the thing came out of the crate at them with a saw in its hands they probably just thought it was caused by a power surge,” I say sarcastically. \n“What – you’re thinking we should just admit defeat?” the PFY asks. \n“Well, I’m not sure about the wisdom of annoying people who probably consider ‘Robot Wars’ to be inspirational media...” \n“Puh-leeeeze,” the PFY says, taping an array of stun guns to the side of the Bot. \n. . . The next day... \n“Well, they say they’ve definitely sorted out all the problems this time!” the Boss chirps happily, “even though the place is apparently down to a skeleton staff – what with it being flu season! This was just another loose wire.” \n“Another loose wire” the PFY says. “Right, we’ll be unpacking it shortly, so hopefully nothing’s shaken loose in the delivery...” \n... moments later... \n“They must be running out of robots by now,” I say as I pry away at the packing crate with the crowbar. \n“You’re telling me!” the PFY nods. “At this rate they... What’s that noise? Isn’t it...” \n“...the starting of a small two stroke engine!!” I say, spinning the crate around to face the doorway, just as the Boss enters to see how things are going – and as a chainsaw wielding bot exits the crate. \n. . . \n“So that’s how they want to play it...” the PFY says moments later as we survey the upended robot at the bottom of the stairwell. \n“Uhuh,” I respond. “And they still haven’t nailed that staircase thing – though perhaps we should keep that to ourselves for now...” \n“So what, fuel it up, reprogram it and send it back to them?” the PFY asks. \n“Sure, but I’d wait till the chainsaw ran out of gas before going to get it.” \n“Why – you think they’d program it to play dead?” \n“It’s what I’d do... Though you realise that we’re up against a bunch of geeks who make robots for a living?” I ask the PFY once we’re back in Mission Control. \n“Uhuh.” \n“And have probably secretly been waiting for the opportunity of a war like this?” \n“And I haven’t been?” the PFY asks. \n"}

So then he got his boss on the phone...” \n“And you told him to get stuffed too, right?” \n“Yep, and then he got his boss on the phone...” \n“And you told him to get stuffed as well, right?” \n“You bet. And then he got our boss on the phone...” \n“And you definitely told him to get stuffed, right?” \n“I did. And then he started going on about how if I didn’t watch myself I wouldn’t be working for the company much longer.” \n“Which is where I came in?” \n“Exactly!” \n“So what’ve you done – deleted his records from HR, Salaries, Security, the Website, the Phone system, Active Directory and updated his swipe card details to read ‘Stolen’?” \n“All but the phone system – because it’d drop the call.” \n“There’s no time like the present!” I say. \nA few clicks and a few seconds of processing delay later the caller details on the PFY’s phone revert to UNKNOWN just before the call drops... \nHalf a minute later the PFY and I have a few chuckles as we hear a swipe card being repeatedly denied at the entrance to Mission Control. A furious hammering starts moments later, followed by a long silence. \n“Wait for it...” I say, nodding at the PFY’s phone. \n>ring< \n“Hello,” the PFY says, in answer to a call from the bloke in the office next to the Boss. \n“What the hell have you done to my swipe card?” the Boss yells – with the tell-tale echo of hands-free mode from the other end. \n“Looks like the Boss is looking to make an example of someone,” I murmur to the PFY. \n“That makes two of us,” the PFY murmurs back, before adopting a louder tone. “Who is this?” \n“You know very well who this is – and if you don’t enable my card immediately...” \n“I’m sorry, I don’t recognise you.” \n“You won’t recognise me from the unemployment line,” the Boss snarls. \n“I’m sorry; I don’t know who you are or where you’re ringing from.” \n“I’m ringing from Dave’s office.” \n“Dave?” \n“Dave Greenwood.” \n“There’s no Dave Greenwood working for this company,” the PFY replies as he taps away furiously at the keyboard, just before the phone goes dead again. \n“Ooh – don’t forget to delete the scanned images of their employment contract – and their home directories - from the SAN!” I blurt. \n“Check!” the PFY says. \n>ring< \n“Sharon who now >clickety<?” the PFY asks as the phone goes dead once more. \nAnd about then it starts to dawn on the IT masses outside Mission Control that this is serious... \nWith only two days remaining till payday – and given the slovenly nature of the company’s HR processing – even if the staff member could prove that they were really working for the company and that their deletion was some form of data error there is NO WAY they’ll be getting any money in this month and mortgages, etc, will probably go unpaid... \nOff in the distance the PFY and I hear several doors slam and lock as people act to protect their pay packets from the Boss’ minus touch... \nA few minutes later the phone rings once more. \n“You can’t possibly think you’re going to get away with this,” the Head of HR burbles smugly down the phone line at us – calling from yet another hands-free phone in the Security offices, no doubt called down there by the three ex-members of IT staff. \n“Sorry – it’s Simon here – Steven’s out of the office running a few errands, I say, while simultaneously texting the PFY “What can’t he get away with again?”. \n“You don’t seriously think that you can simply delete someone out of the system and suddenly the company will treat them as persona non grata!” \n“Really?” I ask, “I think our HR system is a fairly authoritative source for information on who is and isn’t a staff member – and I think our Head of HR would agree.” \n“I don’t think he would...” \n“I do. In fact I’ll check this with him shortly.” \n“You’re talking to him now...” \n“No, I’m talking to someone at security. James, the real Head of HR is bound to agree with me.” \n“James is the assistant head of HR.” \n“Really? That’s not what it says in the HR database.” \nThere’s nothing quite like the sound of a penny dropping from a great height. A penny with the image of the person who jealousy craves your job on the obverse face. That’s the tragedy of a powerful job – there’s generally a queue of envious figures behind it, all waiting patiently... \n“You’ll never get away with it! I have printed documents – my employment contract, my health insurance documents, my annual leave forms!” \n“Health Insurance, hmmm – thanks for pointing that one out. >clickety< Yes, I think you’re right, printed documents do have an air of authority to them. Unless of course they were perhaps kept in the lockable bottom drawer of the desk unit that you get issued with - if you were in fact employed by the company – a lock with a single master key that only my assistant has.

And if I haven’t I’m sure there are people waiting to be promoted into the positions of those that I don’t completely see eye to eye with. Now if you don’t mind I’ll have to ring off now. I need to call security and tell them about the imposters in the building. They’ve been looking for a chance to see how the dogs react...” \n"}

The second series is where Harry and Hermione bring their kids up at Hogwarts.” \n“No, Harry marries Ginny!” \n“Oh that – that was a dream sequence from when Harry doesn’t die. In actual fact the all the Weasleys are all killed at the beginning of the second series.” \n“B... by the spirit of Voldemort and the Cruciatus Curse?” \n“Nah, Harry by accident. He accidentally switches a tanning booth on and the poor Weasleys go up like ants under a magnifying glass.” \n“You’re lying!” \n“No, it’s true!” the PFY says. “I’ve got a mate who does typesetting for the editor’s preview editions of books. He told me about it - and he’s even sent me the whole preview set.” \n“Where?” our user gasps. \n“They’re in this crate here. Hang on, we’ll go and get a crowbar and we’ll get them out for you,” the PFY says, as we head to the door. \nSeconds later the sound of creaking wood can be heard as the Potter-spotter pries away at the crate anxiously, not wanting to wait... \n. . . \n“Railgun powered Shuriken launcher,” the PFY says thoughtfully, a few minutes and a loud crash later. “Interesting.” \n“Not as interesting as this,” I say, cautiously prodding the bot at the bottom of the stairwell before removing several security screws in the bot’s lid. \n“What?” \n“Tadaaa,” I say, withdrawing a small video camera hidden in the base of the bot. “This baby was timed to start the moment the bot was activated...” \n. . . moments later at Mission Control . . . \n“So they unpacked it in an empty carpark building,” the PFY says, gazing at the video footage. “What a sneaky idea!” \n“Yep,” I say. “And see how they use the armoured window in the stairwell doors to observe what happens when they push a store dummy out on a wheelie chair. Ingenious! This calls for some serious thinking. Get me some lager!” \n. . . a day later. . . \n“So what’ve you come up with?” the PFY asks expectantly. \n“A master plan!” I respond proudly. “Upon activation the Bot does... nothing!” \n“Nothing?” \n“Yep. Then, when it notices a change in light intensity - ie, when someone approaches - it starts puncturing these.” \n“Cans of... cheap.. pepper spray,” the PFY says disappointedly. \n“Yeah. Whadya think?” \n“It’s a little...” \n“Crap?” I suggest. \n“Well... yeah.” \n“Indeed it is. You’ll note that the pepper spray cartridges are a very cheap eastern European variety, poorly secured and will probably fall from the Bot’s grip the moment the first can is punctured. In terms of attack value it’s next to worthless.” \n“So why...” \n“Because when the attack fails the bot will, as we know from our video footage, be loaded into the back of a van and taken back to their labs for some re-engineering.” \n“And will reactivate once it gets into their building – BECAUSE YOU PUT A GPS IN IT!!!!” the PFY gasps. \n“Precisely...” I smirk. \n“I knew...” \n“...precisely what it’s not going to do. No, the robot DOES have a GPS in it which IS integral to the plan - but it’s not triggered by locational information.” \n“Not triggered by locational information...” the PFY says thoughtfully, knowing that if he can’t work it out he’ll be paying for tomorrow night’s drinks. “Uh... ELEVATION!” \n“Nope..” I reply, thinking happy free lager thoughts. \n. . . \n“The BLOODY BLACKWALL TUNNEL,” the PFY says disgustedly as he hands over a fistful of notes to the Barman. \n“Yes indeedy,” I say. “Nothing quite like the absence of all GPS signals to indicate that a vanload of robo-geeks – in a confined space – has just entered a busy road tunnel with no safe means of escape.” \n“Which is where the non-eastern-European tear gas canister came in,” the PFY sighs as the barman gestures for some more notage to cover the ridiculously expensive imported hand-fashioned lager that I’ve just become accustomed to... \n"}

Any sane programmer would check for the presence of sandpaper instead of a polishing mop.” \n“Or a 150mm, 72 tooth milling cutter, spinning at 2500 RPM. For instance,” the PFY adds. \n“This can’t go on,” the Boss snaps. “They were already threatening legal action after the accident in the tunnel.” \n“How’s that our fault?” I ask. “It’s simply irresponsible to build a robot with a tear gas canister in it in the first place!” \n“They say they didn’t!” \n“Next they’ll be saying that they didn’t build it with a sonic cannon in it either – but we know they did because the windows in their building disintegrated yesterday.” \n“They say that you did that as well!” \n“How could we do it?” the PFY asks. “We’re software people!” \n“They claim that they’re the victims of a systematic campaign of violence and that you are the perpetrators,” the Boss says, seeming to warm to the topic. \n“THEY’RE the victims?!” the PFY bleats. “Have you forgotten the chainsaw incident, the shuriken attack and yesterday’s attempt to burn down our offices?” \n“They think that might have been the grease in the bearings spontaneously combusting after a heavy use.” \n“By heavy use I take it they mean when the thing went berserk in the office and repeatedly launched itself, full speed, in random directions?” I ask. “And that the bearings were ‘greased’ with about a gallon of diesel?” \n“I don’t know about that – but they claim that grease loss is quite common in some bearings, though they assure me they’ve made a note to utilise different bearings in the future. They even pointed me to a couple of websites which discuss the issue at length.” \n“There’s websites which discuss all sorts of issues at length,” the PFY points out. “It doesn’t mean that what they say is in any way truthful.” \n“Oh, like the We-Love-Vista fan site?” I ask. \n“Exactly!” \n“Or the Kindle-will-survive-ipad-clones site.” \n“That too...” \n“Or the Duke-Nukem-is-coming website.” \n“NO NO!” the PFY gasps. “That one is true!” \n“Really!?” I gasp. “Say it’s so!!!!” \n“It’s so!” the PFY chirps happily. \n“IN ANY CASE,” the Boss interjects, “they have agreed to take the unit with the lubrication problems back, refund us, and work on ironing out the bugs.” \n“Oh I already ironed out most of them this morning,” the PFY says. \n“Yes, it was a 1 iron wasn’t it?” I ask. \n“I started with a 1 but moved onto a 2 when the handle broke. There was a bit of a tricky lie halfway down the stairwell but I managed a nice shot with a sand wedge.” \n“I’m a wood man myself,” I add, turning on the sleaze, “just ask ‘de ladies’.” \n“I...” the Boss says, wheels spinning in the sand. “They want the machine back!” \n“Well we still have to bring it up from the bottom of the stairwell” the PFY says, “but I suppose we could do that this afternoon?” \n...Later that day... \n“So it’s all there then?” the Boss asks dubiously. \n“Yep,” the PFY says. “Goodish as newish.” \n“Sorry?” \n“The covers were a little dented,” I say, indicating the PFY’s very sparse set of golf clubs. “So we had to bash up some new ones from some metal we had laying around so as ‘not to void the warranty’ - but apart from that it’s exactly the same as it came in.” \n“But you haven’t tampered with the software at all?” \n“My assistant wanted to, but since we’re assured of a refund if we returned this unit I thought it prudent not to risk it.” \n“Excellent. There’s a courier downstairs now!” \n...Ten minutes later... \n“It was brilliant,” the PFY says, burbling on once more about the master plan that I’d not let him implement prior to sending the robot back. “We could have put image recognition into it so it would hunt down geeks but leave normal people alone.” \n“Yeah, but you know that by now they’ll be checksumming the ROM and x-raying for new parts before powering it up.” \nOur conversation is interrupted by the prompt arrival of the Boss. \n“I’ve just heard,” he said. “The robot company’s had a fire.” \n“A QUICK BET!” I say. “ON WHAT TYPE OF FIRE IT IS – LOSER BUYS DRINKS!” \n“DIESEL OIL LUBRICANT FIRE by any chance?” chirps the PFY. \n“Survey says no,” I say, turning to the Boss. “You want in – loser pays for dinner??” \n“FLAMETHROWER!” the Boss says, caught up in the excitement. \n“Survey says no,” I say. “And the winner is....” \n“Bloody magnesium fire,” the PFY says ungraciously as he drags three pints over to our table. “And we ‘just happened’ to have some 1mm magnesium plate ‘just laying around the office’ did we?” \n“I know, it surprised me as well,” I say. “And who could have known that once that stuff gets going the rivets holding the plates together melt like butter, leaving flaming pieces of white hot metal in the wake of a robot programmed to bounce off walls erratically...” \n"}

They’ve got complete building maps, including the locations of all power & network outlets as well as coffee and vending machines... \nSimon: Not going to work... \nStephen: They know how to plug themselves in to recharge when the battery is low... \nSimon: Still not going to work... \nStephen: They’ve got high torque drive motors, full 360 degree cameras – including up and down - GPS locational awareness and completely new, and vastly improved advanced neural learning AI capable of ... \nSimon: Starting to sound like Terminator... \nStephen: ( excitedly ) It knows about that! \nSimon: It knows about what? \nStephen: Terminator. See, in order to make the AI more aware I ran through the footage of all its past mistakes – the stairwells, the lift shafts, etc. Then I played it Robocop and all the Terminators except Salvation. Oh, and I loaded the defender MAME rom – for the noises. \nSimon: Defender? Wh... Doesn’t matter, still not going to work.... \nStephen: It will! The AI is state-of-the art and the on-board processor turned out to be a quad core... \nSimon: Still won’t work. Watch... \nStephen: Watch what? ( looking up from the desktop monitor ) Hey, the code’s just reverted! \nAs we watch we see a multitude of LEDs on the front of the powering-up robot flash simultaneously, then three words – ‘booting alternate ROM’ – appear on the LCD panel. A red lamp beside the panel starts glowing. \nSimon: Yep, did the same to me yesterday when I tried to make it do deliveries. It ran for a couple of minutes before some watchdog circuit reloaded memory from a secondary ROM. \nStephen: Bugger! \nSimon: You can restart it but that just gives you another few minutes. I think the bot company did it so they can only be used ‘for good’. \nStephen: Where’s the fun in that?! \nSimon: Indeedy. That said though, it occurred to me late last night that we could clip the Vcc pin of the backup ROM and it wouldn’t be able to load from it. \nStephen: So which chip is the backup ROM? \nSimon: You mean which of the 30 or so unlabelled and seemingly identical chips is the secondary ROM? No idea – But I suspect we can find out with a simple soldering iron. \nStephen: Ah, desolder the Vcc pin of each chip in turn until the reset no longer works! \nSimon: I was thinking more of holding the soldering iron on a chip till it stops working, but we can go with your idea if you like. \nStephen: Nah, I haven’t got any desoldering braid – and besides it’s a multilayer board. \nCut to the inside of a robot’s top cover. A mass of closely positioned chips with the identification numbers erased are crammed onto a motherboard. A large soldering iron of the type more commonly used to solder earth tags onto high current electrical equipment hoves into view, moving from one chip to the next. \nStephen: Eeny Meeny Miney... \n>hhhssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss< \nStephen: Mo! \nCut to LCD panel on Robot. The words TARGETS ACQUIRED flash momentarily on the display. \nCut to a couple of minutes later. We see the two men standing on a desk with a robot shaped hole in the door... \nSimon: High Torque drive motors you say? \nStephen: Uh. Yeah. \nCut to robots-eye view as it approaches the entrance to a stairwell. The word “RECALCULATING” with a circling arrow appears as the picture stops momentarily. The Robot reverses, turns. \nCut to Lift doors opening. Robot rolls into lift. \nCut to Basement. Robot emerges from lift, rolls quietly over to a locked supply then slowly spins through 360 degrees, pausing momentarily to view the flashing red lamp on a CCTV Camera. \nCut to Mission Control \nStephen: Do you think it knows we’re watching? \nSimon: You’re the one who gave it all the building information – What do you think? \nStephen: Oh, it knows... A BIT of a design flaw that – on reflection. \nCut back to Basement, which is the same as earlier with the exception of the robot-sized hole in the door of the supply cupboard. The lift doors close silently. \nCut to Mission Control: \nStephen: Where’s it going?!!! Ground... First... Second... Second. \nSimon: Uh Oh \nCut to robot’s eye view. \nWe see a large extension lead being plugged into the wall by a metallic arm. \nWe see an electric chainsaw being plugged into the extension lead \nWe see the door to Mission Control with a robot shaped hole in it – approaching quickly... \nWe see the spike end of a fire axe approaching even quicker... \nCut to Mission Control. \nA robot with an axe protruding from its top cover shudders to a stop. The red lamp on the front panel slowly goes dark. \nSimon: So the next time you fudge a ROM perhaps you might build in a bit of a failsafe... \nStephen: Yes, another design flaw when you come to think about it. Still no harm done – and still time for a lunchtime pint. \nCut to Pub \nTwo foaming pints of lager are passed to the PFY in exchange for a shiny new note... \nCut to Robots-Eye view. \nRAM OK \nROM O... \nbooting.... \nCut to Mission Control, an hour later. Simon and Stephen enter Mission Control to find the robot gone. The PFY’s monitor has a text editor open with a single line of text \nNOW I’VE GOT AN AXE, HO HO HO! \nSimon: You didn’t happen to play it Die Hard as well did you? \nStephen: Uh... I... uh... Bit of an implementation flaw, that... \nSimon: To the batstairs Robin! But first.. \nWe see Simon take a snapshot of the dormant robot, print it in colour and hold it up in front of the robot while reaching for a soldering iron \n>hhhssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss< \nSimon: You know what they say – send a thief... Now, to the stairwell.... \nCut to... The landing of stairwell, half an hour later. At the top of the stairs we see a robot waiting patiently. At the bottom of the stairs we also see a robot waiting patiently. \nStephen: So which one’s which? \nSimon: Good question. My plan had been just to look for the one WITHOUT the axe hole in the top – but it turns out they’ve both got them... \nStephen: That would be the advanced neural learning AI... \nSimon: Another... design flaw? \nStephen: Well, everyone sees with 20\/20 hindsight.... \nSimon: Oooh look, the top one’s moving... \nT O B E C O N T I N U E D. . . \n"}

Calm. Musical. \n“WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?!!!!”, the Boss shouts, \nAnd back to reality... \nSo the PFY and I are trapped on a landing between floors while a couple of mutant security robots block our exit from above and below. To make matters worse the Boss has inadvertently blundered into the stairwell with us and narrowly avoided being turned into rough-cut schnitzel. The same cannot be said for his briefcase however... \nIt’s looking bad for us. Being trapped in a stairwell over the weekend by two vicious chainsaw wielding robots pales in comparison to being trapped in a stairwell over the weekend by two vicious chainsaw wielding robots while the Boss recounts the high points of his five year project to build an eighth scale replica of Stirling’s Victoria locomotive. \n“What I don’t understand” the PFY says, before the Boss can get started “is how the second robot went bananas?” \n“Easy” I reply “Your ‘advanced learning neural’ crap appears to have enabled your robot to learn how to make other mutants like itself. You know, like vampires, zombies and Facebook users.” \n“Yes, that was perhaps a bit of a d-” \n“Don’t say design flaw” I snap, a little jaded with that particular excuse. “A design flaw is omitting reinforcing between the rear panel and gas tank of a consumer vehicle - which might eventually kill you. Designing a robot whose ultimate purpose is eventually to become so intelligent that it will kill you is something else altogether..,” \n“Designing a..,” the Boss blurts, \n“I...,” the PFY interrupts, \n“No, it’s fine! At this point recrimination is not helping us in any way. We need to address our current situation. We’re trapped by robots with no simple method of escape,” \n“My cell phone battery is flat,” the PFY adds, \n“...and mine is on my desk. The overpowered cattle prod appears to have suffered some form of internal meltdown and the pinch is completely discharged,” \n“The remote control for the building power isn’t working” the PFY says, pressing repeatedly at a button on a small black box on his key ring. \n“In short,” I say, “It’s time to face facts. Technology, like a poorly trained Alsatian, has turned on us.” \n“No!” the PFY gasps \n“Yes.” I respond. “This isn’t some randomly coincidental sequence of events – this is fate. For too long we have neglected the power of technology and taken it for granted – at our own peril. The Gods of Technology are angry. They require...” \n“Human sacrifice!!!” the PFY says. \nActually, he doesn’t say that at all. He just thinks it. \nI know, because I’m thinking it too. \nThe Boss, on the other hand, is probably thinking about the Onion Bhajis on the lunch menu. \n“Exactly” I say. I mean, think. \nThe PFY nods. \n“At times like this,” I say to the Boss, “I like to ask myself what MacGyver would do?” \n“Oh yeah!” the Boss says, “fabricate something from whatever materials are available to solve the current problem.” \n“Exactly!” I respond, “We need to use whatever we can lay our hands on to help us divert the attention of the robots until such time as we can lay our hands on a more suitable solution,” \n“Like an axe,” the PFY adds, \n“What do you propose?” \n“Well firstly, like MacGyver we need to take an inventory of the raw materials available to us,” \n“Oh, ok. Well I have a... disposable lighter, a little credit card torch\/knife combo, and two.. aspirin. Not a lot really,” \n“Well obviously, like MacGyver, we’re limited in the raw materials available to us – however this may not necessarily be a limitation because his real talent was in recognising the potential of raw materials when he saw them. Now tell me, are you particularly attached to the lighter, card or aspirin?” \n“Not really, why?” \n“I’m simply asking because like in MacGyver it is inevitable that we will have to damage the raw materials to create the solution we need”. \n“I see,” the Boss nods. “Fair enough.” \n“So,” I say. “Are we agreed that if we’re going to get out of this, it’s time for each of us to make individual sacrifices?” \n“Yes”, the PFY says. \n>Shove!< \nHalf an hour, several sturdy blows with an axe and one ambulance call later.. \n“You know, I’m not completely sure the Boss realised that he was the individual we were talking about sacrificing” the PFY says \n“Management” I sigh “There’s some things you can’t explain to them, no matter how clearly you put it..” \n"}

Before he can switch to hibernate, I draw him back into the conversation by mentioning security robots once more. Nothing drags a bloke back to the light quicker than 1 part gadget mixed with 2 parts potential danger. \n“I thought they were all broken.” \n“They are” the PFY says “and fraught with bugs. What we’re suggesting is that we build our own security robots – to make sure we record whoever’s breaking into things.” \n“They can’t have weapons!” the Boss cautions \n“No weapons needed” I say “All we really want is a camera and the ability to move around.” \n“No lifts or stairwells!” the Boss snaps again, thinking of the recent past \n“Fine. We could make robots that simply stay on a floor and observe.” \n“I’m not going to spend a lot of money!” he cautions \n“And why would you?” I ask, making a sweeping gesture into the room “When we have all the raw materials on hand!” \n“How?” \n“Oh, just parts from some servers, laptops, printers – plus the odd vending machine – etc. In fact we have three of them up and running in the building already” \n“Where?” the Boss asks \n“Well the first one we activated a few minutes ago” I reply “– the vending machine on the Balcony of level 6. It works like a vending machine but is also a completely mobile surveillance device. Has a 12 sector movement detector along with a wireless lan connection for voice and video plus inbuilt facial recognition. It can transmit a suspect’s movements while monitoring their head movements as well. The moment it detects someone looking at it, it becomes a static vending machine again” \n“You know, like the statues on Doctor Who.” the PFY adds. \n“I... And this is up and running now?” the Boss gasps \n"}

The rest of the department are, but this is one Christmas you’ll not be visiting any of the other departments!” \n“But we always go to departmental Christmas functions!” the PFY protests “We get things going and keep the momentum up. We get the party happening!!!” \n“Yes, that’s the problem. Apparently some of the party games you’ve instigated in the past have been poorly received.” \n“Poorly received?!! THEY LOVE THEM!” \n“They love some of them. And generally not everyone loves them.” \n“WHO DOESN’T LOVE THEM?!” \n“Usually the victim.” \n“The Victim?” \n“Yes, the target of the game ‘Pin the cattle prod on the Board Member’ for instance.” \n“It was dark, the contestant got confused and picked up a cattle prod instead of a self-adhesive tail!” I cry. \n“It’s an easy mistake to make” the PFY concurs “Many’s the time I’ve picked up a cattle prod thinking it was a lint remover as I’ve helped groom one of your predecessors before an important board meeting about slashing the IT budget.” \n“In any case” I add “That was just one game – and only the Beancounters department!” \n“Yes, I heard about the subsequent game of ‘Pin the blame on the Accountant’? He said he thought he was playing a variant of laser strike!” \n“I think he’d been drinking” the PFY says sadly “And all too often people just don’t know when to say ‘when’.” \n“You mean like after the Piñata fiasco in HR a couple of years back?” \n“Look” the PFY says, “it was just two games which met with tragic consequences. The winner of the blindfold wheelie chair race rolled into the piñata circle just after we’d handed out the cricket bats. It could have happened to anyone!” \n“Only he claims he wasn’t playing any game but was duct taped into the chair!” \n“That’s just the concussion talking!” \n“So it was just an accident?” \n“Yes” \n“Like the toaster in the punch bowl?” \n“A warning to us all about placing an electrical appliance too close to a large bowl of liquid during holiday season!” \n“P.R. said you bought the toaster with you,” the Boss counters \n“Of course we did! Some of those hors d'oeuvres are shabbily prepared and woefully undercooked – and when you take into account the Pate and fish fillings it’s only sensible to make sure they’re cooked through! I mean no one expected the toaster to fall off the Lazy Susan!” \n“No one except the Deputy Director of HR who just happened to be wearing rubber gloves and standing on a rubber mat when the Director dipped the ladle in the bowl?” \n“They were his presents from the Secret Santa!” the PFY blurts \n“The Secret Santa in this case being?” \n“I... think it was me!” I say “And I got them for him because I recalled a conversation I’d had with him about how much he enjoys... dishwashing... and... uh.. car mats!” \n“A suspicious person might look at the pre-Christmas financial activity of the company and suspect that there was some form of service being offered to departments with unpopular people?” the Boss hints \n“How do you mean?” \n“Well I see notice that in each of these ‘incidents’ a large order has come from the department concerned yet no IT items appear to have been delivered to them.” \n“That’s the problem with lead times and a 31-December financial close off date,” I say \n"}

Dressed in an elf suit. Two stockings are hung by the Boss' door with care, In the hopes that a bonus cheque soon will be there. \nSecurity is snug in their office – after boozing The Christmas punch overspiked to guarantee snoozing. The Bastard and PFY at a monitor peering To see if the Cayman's Bank transfer is clearing. \nWhen out from the server room a clattering arises \"Sounds like a chiller fan,\" the PFY surmises Away to the viewing screen the Bastard now dashes, In time to see smoke, flame and a few lightning flashes. \n\"That's torn it\" they gasp, as alerts start their bleeping The siren is bound to end Security's sleeping. Then up in Accounting, some figures start squirming As suspicions of larceny get their confirming.. \nDown through the stairwell, the booted feet ring As our two heroes recognise an Accountancy Sting!!!! Shredding the cookies, zapping the cache, Erasing the docs from the 16 gig flash. \nThe door crashing open and lawyers burst in, Along with constabulary flashing their tin. A warrant presented for searching of kit To the casual observer it looks like... deep shit. \nBut smiles from our heroes – it's all a mistake There's no banking transfer, just apologies to make. A test of the audit code, simple as that No money is missing, no need for \"a chat\" . \nThe records are verified, while all remain calm There's nothing amiss, a complete false alarm. The law soon departing, security too, The lawyers leave also, with fuck-all to do. \nThe Beancounters and HR agreed on a plan, of instant dismissals for \"abuse of the LAN\" . Demanding to verify servers on-site, They enter the machine room and flick on the light. \nThe servers all present and working as stated Anger dissolving; job cuts abated. The HR and Beancounter vocal threats cease As a gloved finger presses on \"Halon Release\" . \nAuto door locking, the Halon clouds loom, Preparing to dump into the server room. But wait, HR rushes, vaults over a desk And before you know what, \"Halon Hold-Off\" is pressed. \n... \nHere at a stalemate the two groups are gazing through triple-thick layers of security glazing. Then one HR droid pulls a phone from his coat preparing to dial 9-9-9, with a gloat. \nThe chuckles from HR and beancounters start fading, As \"Santa's elf\" flashes and starts activating. Self-test completed, it blocks off the door, Lifts up a floor tile, pulls up a saw. \n2-Stroke. 125cc. Nice. \nPanic breaks out as the workers avoid A fully cranked chainsaw in the \"hands\" of a droid Ten seconds later, a piezo fanfare, as a crapload of Halon's released to the air. \nThree minutes later the Robot's quiesced, Chainsaw untainted, the workers \"at rest\" .

THE MACHINE!” I murmur to the PFY. \n“Say what now?” the PFY asks. \n“The Machine. Like in Princess Bride . You’ll notice how management’s been conspicuously quiet over the past couple of weeks?” \n“I thought they were still on holiday,” the PFY says. \n“Not at all. No, they’ve been out getting another dose of ‘The work practices of highly effective companies’. One of the CEO’s pals from college has himself a virtual money printing service by pretending to know what made Google and Facebook successful and selling the ideas as a training course for management. I can only assume that team meetings are rated highly ...” \n“Team conferences I think you’ll find,” the PFY says. \n“I sit corrected.” \nA few minutes later ... \n“So, I’d just like to do a quick around-the-room,” the Boss starts, “and I thought it might be good if we could start the meeting by bringing up any workplace safety issues that anyone might like looked into – because a safe workplace is a happy workplace.” \nThe uncomfortable silence that follows this is the same that would happen in any workplace. No one wants to be the one who starts the ball rolling – but if it does start, no one wants to be left out. It’s like watching one of those cycling pursuit races ... \n“Well they could probably look at screwing the bookshelves to the walls,” a pasty geek from the web team suggests to break the silence. \n“And fix the shelves in the photocopier room,” someone else adds. “One day all that paper is going to fall on someone.” \n“The wire on the dishwasher is very frayed ...” \nAND THEY’RE OFF!!! The Boss is positively glowing! \n“You two have been pretty quiet,” the Boss says to the PFY and me when everyone in the room has raised at least one workplace safety issue in the group free-for-all. “Nothing to add?” \n“The coffee mugs,” I say, trying to get this over with as quick as possible. “They’re the same colour as the carpet. Someone might not see one and trip on it and have a nasty accident.” \n“Really?” the Boss asks disappointedly. “Is that it?” \n“I like to think we’re problem-solvers,” I say. “Like for instance the woman that says that her air-conditioning sensor makes crackling noises when she bangs it. Not banging it seems to be one of the more effective ways of eliminating that problem ...” \n... \nBecause of our reticence, the PFY and I end up leaving the meeting with a pad of orange workplace safety forms to fill out – because the Boss is sure that we’ll find something hazardous if we just look hard enough. And to make matters worse, we’ll be having \"Team Safety Conferences\" every morning for the next two bloody weeks! \nTruth be told, I happen to share this opinion – it’s just the ideas themselves I’m not keen on sharing ... \n“So how are we getting on?” the Boss asks a couple of hours later. “Got your thinking caps on?” \n“Not really,” I admit. “In fact I’m a bit stuck. I mean accidents are accidents – they happen out of the blue. If you were to think about them in advance wouldn’t that almost fall into the area of, I dunno ... planning?” \n“Well if you can’t think of anything, you can’t think of anything,” the Boss responds, hastily realising he’ll need to add a couple of names to his hazard list ... “We’ll just work on the issues we have.” \n“Oh good, so we’ll stop banging thermostats, avoid loaded bookshelves in earthquakes, etc, and things will be back to normal?” \n“Oh no. Each department has agreed to commit resources to fixing safety issues so that staff realise their opinions matter. We’ll be fixing things immediately.” \n“And by resources you mean?” the PFY asks, smelling gravy and looking for the train. \n“It’ll come out of the operational budget.” \n“ Our operational budget?” I ask. \n“The IT operational budget, yes.” \nAnd this is where it gets personal. Your average web page hacker sucks about twenty quid of operational cash in your normal financial year – 25 if he drinks decaf. Screwing all our bookshelves to the wall in an approved manner with earthquake rated restraints is likely to increase that figure by 100 – and I hate to think what a new aircon system will cost. \n“Perhaps the issues that have been raised aren’t real issues?” I suggest. \n“What do you mean?” the Boss asks. \n“Perhaps they’re just problems with user education. I mean we can reduce the risk from bookshelves simply by giving them a low centre of gravity. If people just put all the heavy stuff on the bottom shelf they’d be next to impossible to topple.” \n“And the aircon sensor. If the user simply set it to the correct temperature and wore sensible clothing there wouldn’t be a need to change it at all.” \n“So you think you can educate people and eliminate some issues?” the Boss asks. \n“Absolutely.” \nThe next morning at the Team Safety Conference ... \n“Okay, should we get started?” I ask the Boss. “Busy day ahead.” \n“I’m just waiting for everyone to get here,” the Boss counters. \n“I ... err ... everyone is here,” The PFY says. \n“No, I mean the rest of the team.” \n“This is us,” the PFY says. \n“No I mean the rest of the staff from the meeting yesterday.” \n“Oh them. Well, some of them might be in a little later – busy day yesterday and all that.” \n“In what way?” \n“Well the bloke who was talking about the photocopier paper stacked on those crap shelves ...” \n“Jeff” \n“Yes, well he was showing me when the paper actually fell of the shelves. Onto him.” \n“And the guy who was talking about the dishwasher,” I add. \n“Roger.” \n“Turns out the wire WAS frayed, the earth WAS disconnected and when you slammed the door shut the whole thing became live. Just some minor burns and a bit of a fright.” \n“And I suppose Jane’s air-conditioning remote caught fire did it?” the Boss snaps. \n“I don’t know, you’ll have to ask her I guess.” \n“I’ll do that!” \n“But you might want to wait a couple of days – she was rushing down a corridor and banged into a bookshelf and it fell on her.” \n“Right,” The Boss snaps. “And the rest of the staff can’t remember the things they thought were hazardous I suppose?” \n“Well we talked to them, but apparently they don’t think it’s that big of a deal any more,” I say. \n“Well we’re still going to address the issues we know about – the shelves, the bookshelves, and the aircon.” \n“The aircon’s not a problem!” the PFY chips back. \n“And yet I think it is,” the Boss snaps, getting up to leave. “I’ll be putting in a requisition today to sort these issues out, ASAP. Our staff need to know they’re valued and that we take their issues seriously!” \nMy calming words are drowned out by the slamming of the door as the boss fumes out. \n“Wait for it ...” I say \n“Wait for wha ... >CRASH!< \n“Goodness, that sounds like someone tripping on a coffee cup and faceplanting a pallet of servers awaiting recycling,” I say. “You know – I pointed that out yesterday and the company did nothing about it.

Memo two thousand and eleven dash one dash one,” I reply, “workplace resiliency.” \n“Yes, I can read the title, but what is it?” \n“It’s a memo outlining the things we should be addressing for systems and networks resiliency.” \n“And you expect me to take this seriously?” \n“Of course. You asked us to identify areas of risk in the company so we worked through the issues at length over the past two days and considered the changes we might make to ensure the company is protected both from disaster and accident.” \nWhich is a complete lie. In actual fact we hastily cobbled together a variety of randomly selected Google documents about disaster planning, disaster recovery into a semi-coherent investment guide for senior management. Then went to the pub for two days… \n…Earlier in the week… \n“I don’t get it,” the PFY says. “We’re recommending dual UPS units with dual generators, fed from dual supply circuits via dual redundant switching? It’d cost millions!!!” \n“Probably not millions, but certainly more than the company would want to spend,” I reply. “I’ve not even got to the terabit backup network linking us to our hot site.” \n“They’ll never go for it!!!” \n“Of course they won’t – that’s the point.” \n“What is?” the PFY asks. \n“It’s the Big Buck Pass,” I sigh. “The insurance company wants to reduce their risk so they’ve upped the premiums claiming we don’t have a policy document which outlines how we mitigate risk - using this year’s terminology. The auditors – who should have seen this coming – raise it with the board as an ‘audit issue’ a couple of nanoseconds before the insurance bill comes in. The board raises the audit issue with the CEO, the CEO passes the buck to senior management, senior management pass it to middle management, middle management to line management and line management to us.” \n“Yes, I get all that, but what are we doing?” \n“We’re pushing the risk back up the food chain by suggesting the most expensive solution possible.” \n“Why?” \n“Imagine we have no offsite backups but decide we’d get by if you took a portable drive home every night.” \n“We don’t have any offsite backups. And the only hard drive I take home is full of completed torrents!” \n“That’s why I said ‘Imagine’. Now if the drive fails when the company really needs it we’ll be held responsible for not protecting the data to the best of our ability. If, however, we recommend an offsite disk storage solution that’s outside of our spending authority then the Boss has to authorise it before we can proceed. When he says no then we’re in the clear – buck shifted.” \n“You’re losing me…” the PFY says. \n“The Secret to the Big Buck Pass,” I say, “is in recommending a solution that someone further up the chain will say NO to. So the more outrageous the solution the better, because as it gets more expensive it needs to go further up the food chain to get approved or denied. Then, when disaster strikes we’ll say we always knew this might happen and had recommended a good solution but it got turned down. Buck passed.” \n“So why don’t we just recommend the offsite disk storage idea?” \n“It’s not expensive enough. See, if it’s something we can afford they might agree to it - and undoubtedly axe part of our ever decreasing operational budget to pay for. If, however, it’s something ridiculous that we couldn’t possibly afford it’ll get vetoed by someone up the food chain and we just keep the veto memo for... insurance… purposes.” \n“And they wouldn’t try and implement it over a couple of years – part this year and part next?” \n“Not if it’s ridiculously expensive,” I say. \n“But won’t the Boss just say we have to do something cheaper?” \n“He would – but to counter that we embellish the risk with fake numbers – like the 103 reported cases of UK companies losing over a million quid as the result of poorly backed up data in 2010 alone. And those are just the reported cases!!” \n“And the real number?” \n“Who cares? The Boss will hear “103” and “a million quid” and crap himself. By the time it gets to the IT Director it’ll be 153 and 2 million. But he’ll change “reported” to “apparently reported” just in case the IT Director checks.” \n“Will he?” \n“Course he won’t. IT Directors check numbers for accuracy about as often as they check their faeces for fibre – i.e. only when it’s in their face. He’ll pass it up and it’ll get axed somewhere below the CEO.” \n“And this will work?” \n“Sure, everyone does it!” \n“Like when?” \n“Like when the HR person was complaining about how much liability the company was carrying from accumulated leave from the Beancounters who never take leave. And someone suggested pushing the worst offenders down the lift shaft.” \n“And were you the one who suggested pushing them down the lift shaft?” \n“Hell, I was the one who pushed them down the lift shaft! But who could have known their grandparented contract gave them unlimited sick leave. So then someone suggested maybe the company should stop paying for their life support and maybe the problem would solve itself...” \n“And that someone was you?” \n“It might have been.” \n“This has stopped being about passing the buck and just become a brag session hasn’t it?” the PFY asks unkindly. \n“I’m trying to teach you about the machinations of a large company!” I counter. “Machinations that take years to learn. Like the time the Boss vetoed a workplace resiliency proposal and someone suggested we take him to the pub, feed him absinthe till he thinks he’s Conan the Barbarian, hand him a sword and let him out of the lift at the Beancounter’s floor.” \n“I think I’ve seen that movie!” the PFY says. \n“How did it end?” \n"}

The November 2010 assault shut down servers and deleted data, causing damage and lost productivity costs estimated at $200,000 in the process. \nGucci lost access to documents and email for nearly 24 hours, while other documents and emails were permanently lost. The attack relied on the use of a fictitious VPN access account allegedly established by Yin while still on Gucci's payroll. \nThe rogue employee tricked his former colleagues into activating a token associated with this account in June 2010, a month after his contract of employment was terminated by Gucci for unrelated reasons in May 2010. \nThe fashion house called in investigators after the November assault, who tracked the attack back to Yin. In Monday, the alleged hacker was indicted on a 50-count rap that includes computer hacking, identity theft and falsifying business records charges. The most serious charge – computer tampering in the first degree – is punishable on conviction by up to 15 years behind bars. \nThe case is being prosecuted by the New York County District Attorney's office, which put out a statement on the case here . \nRegardless of the outcome of the case, the incident serves to illustrate the importance of managing user accounts, particularly in cases where a worker leaves the employment of a firm. \nMore commentary on this aspect of the case can be found in a blog post by Sophos here . ® \n"}

We don't have systems codes or operational availability and the last person who tried to force us into a service level agreement is rumoured to be very close to being able to touch a lightswitch without crapping himself. \n\"So what's Magenta mean?\" the Director's PA asks, in the same hushed tones I'm sure she'll use to pass this on to the rest of the IQ-challenged crowd at lunchtime – in between salacious gossip about the royal family and this week's reality TV recap. \n\"Magenta means operational reversion standby,\" I say, cranking up the seemingly technical importance of Code Magenta without actually giving any useful information away. At this point operational reversion standby could mean I'm waiting outside the toilets to take a dump or I'm ready to press the power button on my desktop machine. \n\"Really!\" she gasps. \"Is that bad?\" \n\"Bad's a relative term. Code Hot-Chilli-Red is worse, and Code Victim Orange is better – but all of them are worth looking into.\" \nI could talk crap like this for days, but I'm not going to. We're at Code Magenta! \nCode Magenta, as the PFY and I both know, is the code for hostile takeover. Not of the company, but of the IT services. In these days of Cloud Computing, SAAS, and mobile workspaces, the streets are littered with smooth-talking types in casually precise business clothes talking the words we all like to hear – simplicity, redundancy, and of course, lower cost. \nThe same people who used words like \"synergy\" , \"enterprise solution\" and \"Total Cost of Ownership\" five years ago are still using words like that now, only this time they've added to their vocabulary with the catchphrases-de-jour of the cloud mentality. \nSure enough as my conversation with the PA dies a natural death from three-syllable word poisoning, two smooth-looking sales types rock on up to see the Director. \n\"Simon!\" the Director gasps guiltily, noticing me outside for the first time. \"How convenient. I was just going to listen to a presentation about some potential areas for savings in our IT budget and I thought you might like to sit in!\" \nNow sitting through a sales pitch from some clean-shaven charmer fresh out of MBA school is about as appealing to me as performing my own testicular surgery with a hole punch and a 100watt soldering iron, however I know the Director doesn't want me there, so right away I’m starting to warm to it. \n\"Fantastic!\" I say, faking enthusiasm, and shaking hands all round. \nTen minutes later we're in the thick of it, and I'm hearing how data abstraction has never been so good and how RAID comes a poor second to clouded duplicated RAID spread out over the globe. The iPad2-rich media presentation has the desired \"shiny bead\" effect on the Director and by the end of it he's almost begging to sign up. \n\"We've already got that,\" I say to the Director, before he can whip his pen out. Well I assume it's a pen he's fumbling around furiously in his trouser pocket for. \n\"I ... thought all your data is in the server room,\" Smooth Guy 1 says. \n\"No, it's in our own Cloud,\" I ad-lib. \"Well, when I say 'our own' I mean we signed up to a partnership agreement with several companies all over the Globe to each backup the other's services in a multi-homed data centre cloud,\" I reply, turning to the Director. \"Surely I told you about that?\" \n\"Uh – no...\" \n\"Oh. Well I meant to. Yeah, we have a five-year contract with each other to make available a stack of virtual resource. We use freebie sync and schedule software to ensure redundancy amongst all the member partners and to our systems it just looks like it's hosted in the server room like a normal system.\" \n\"So your data is totally protected?\" Smooth Guy 2 asks, too professional to cough \"*bullshit*\" . \n\"Absolutely,\" I say smugly, knowing he can't prove me wrong. \n\"And your data sits?\" he asks, trying to find a weak spot in my lies. \n\"All over the place,\" I lie. \"I know we had some problems after the recent tsunami, so I can only assume that part of one datacentre was partially deployed in Japan but I'm fairly confident that we'll be back to full 100 per cent redundancy once our local data is completely resynced and verified.\" \nSmooth Guy 2's a little put out at my answer, which can only mean he was going to suggest we power-down the data centre to test our redundancy, but he knows that any outage would immediately be blamed on Fukishima. \n\"Well it looks like you're all covered, what with the global network and that 'contract' and all,\" Smooth Guy 1 says with just a dash of sarcasm. \"Though I'd really like to see that contract – just out of professional interest.\" \n\"I don't see why not,\" The Director agrees. \n\"Sure,\" I say, dialling the PFY on hands-free. \n\"Systems,\" the PFY answers. \n\"Hey, it's me. Can you bring over a copy of that Global Cloud contract that we signed with those overseas companies to share each other's resources to create our own multihomed Cloud? You know the one with the freebie sync and schedule software?\" \n\"I think it's in the document safe,\" the PFY lies. \"I'll just dig it up.\" \n\"Yes, make sure it's the latest version – the one with the five-year term.\" \nThe next five minutes pass quietly.

By the time of sentencing, he'd already been in prison for two years. Lawyers demanded the money as restitution to pay back the council for money spent trying to regain access to their own network. \nChilds said at the time that he did not trust officials who demanded access. He finally handed over the phrases to San Francisco's mayor Gavin Newsom during a prison visit. \nAt the time of sentencing, San Francisco claimed the downtime had cost the city $900,000. Childs, 46, was arrested in July 2008 for preventing access to the city's FiberWAN network, which carried about 60 per cent of the network traffic for city departments.

We later find that the gnat in question only lives in a certain house in a certain street in a certain city and that the composition of the fart indicates it sampled the vindaloo cooked by the suspect only moments prior to the murder.” \n“No, I didn’t know that. But it was short-lived, you say?” \n“Yes, I think things started going downhill when my assistant pointed out that no one in the audience was retarded enough to believe that even the best image enhancing software could pull the license plate of a vehicle 27 blocks away from the reflection in a shop window caught by a 640 by 480 CCTV image in an off-licence.” \n“Or that every hacker in the world had a secret way of translating email address to home address,” the PFY adds. \n“Or that you can copy the entire contents of a 1 Terabyte hard drive to a USB stick with 2GB stamped prominently on the side in 14 seconds.” \n“And they cancelled the show?” \n“Yes, but if you like we can use our television script based IT skills to determine who damaged these computers?” \n“Well... yes, if you think it will work?” the Boss burbles. \n“You bet. We’ll have it sorted inside the hour. Or 16 minutes if we don’t stop for adverts.” \n“So you want me to run up a GUI interface using visual basic to track the killer’s IP Address?” the PFY asks. \n“Yes do that – although we already know the first number in the address is 324 dot something.” \n“Ah, so it’s from downtown,” the PFY nods knowingly. \n“You could get all that from an IP address?” the Boss says. \n“Oh yeah. If we’d had the second number we could have twittered the blog and found out what floor they were on by reverse polarising the bit pattern,” I say, shaking my head sadly. “But it looks like we’ll have to do it the slow way.” \n“What?” the PFY asks. “You mean we’re going to have to...” \n“Yes” I say. “Low-level format the BIOS to update the surface computing then find the timestamp from the IRC!” \n“But won’t that mean that they could reverse-hack the router and feedback our access matrix into the algorithm!?” \n“That’s just a risk we’d have to take!” I say, tapping away on my cellphone. “Right, I’m jacked into the web!” \n“What do you mean, risk?” the Boss asks nervously. \n“If they reverse-hack the router while he’s jacked in and feedback the access matrix it’s only a matter of time before they could corrupt the vector of the database algorithm – and we’d be powerless to stop it!” \n“Couldn’t you just unplug the network from the wall?” the Boss suggests. “Or turn the power off?” \nThe PFY and I look on in disgust, shaking our heads \n“Once they’ve hacked the matrix…” \n“Reverse-hacked the router,” the PFY corrects. \n“Yes, the router matrix.” \n“The access matrix,” the PFY mumbles. \n“Yes, well, once they’ve done that it doesn’t matter what you do – you could unplug the machine from the wall and pull out the power supplies – but the program will keep running.” \n“Yes,” the PFY says. “And if it’s still running it would spread throughout the whole building in a geographically sequential manner, room by room, floor by floor…” \n“And there’s no way to stop it?” \n“The only way to stop it is to find the machines with the orange network warning lamp flashing and destroy them before they can pass the virus on at orange baud – which is what I think happened here.” I say \n“You mean...” the PFY says. \n“Yes, someone jacked into the net already - then, when they realised what they did, tried to stop the spread of infection.” \n“So did they manage to stop it?” \n“We may never know,” I shrug. “The new nanovector viruses hide themselves in the parity handshaking. The only time they ever show up is in the orange network warning lamps. But I suppose we should check. I’ll take the floor below us, Ray, you take this floor and Stephen you take the floor above us. If you find a machine with the orange network warning lamp flashing, yank it off the desk and smash it on the floor – THEN MOVE ON. We don’t have time to explain. Once the access matrix has been double hacked we’ve only got seconds before the 32bit Ramdrive is digitally streamed to the mainframe!” \nTen minutes later… \n“Completely bananas,” I say to Security, as they drag Ray away. “He just went nuts, said something crazy about personal privacy and then started smashing the place up.” \n“Blog me!” the PFY adds sadly, shaking his head. \nAnd… \nOne minute later… \n“Two pints of your finest and a couple of bags of salt and vinegar crisps,” the PFY says. \nAnd we didn’t even stop for an ad break… \n"}

You know, how the viscosity of time is inversely proportional to what you'd like the viscosity to be.\" \n\"You’ve lost me.\" \n\"Okay,\" I sigh, opening an Excel chart. \"Here, on a Monday morning, when there's lots of interesting stuff happening, time flows reasonably well. Friday afternoons however, time flows like road tar on a cold morning.\" \n\"What's that then?\" the PFY asks, pointing at another section of the graph. \n\"Ah, that was Wednesday evening.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And I was having a couple of drinks with that nice woman from the inkjet company.\" \n\"And time flowed...\" \n\"Like water out a firehose.\" \n\"I take it she didn’t know that we don’t have any inkjet printers at that stage?\" \n\"Correct. You can see the rapid incline of the graph at >this< point when she found out. A section I like to call 'the long walk home'.\" \n\"And yet it's still wasn’t as bad as Friday afternoons?\" \n\"Yes, well-spotted. It seems that alcohol reduces the viscosity of time.\" \n\"So time flows faster when you're drinking?\" \n\"Exactly. So while in real time the walk home took three hours plus kebab stops, to my mind it was five minutes and someone stuffed a kebab wrapper in my letterbox.\" \n\"So it really does speed things up?\" \n\"It does. I checked today by spending lunchtime at the pub. Eight minutes.\" \n\"You were gone for two hours!\" \n\"I know!\" \n\"So were you at a pub in the morning about five weeks back?\" \n\"No, why?\" \n\"The graph says you were!\" \n\"No, the graph says that time was flowing fast.\" \n\"And the difference is?\" \n\"The difference is that was the time I was using my wireless mouse on the Boss' machine to quit without saving every time he tried to send an email.\" \n\"I see. And... two mornings ago?\" \n\"That was when the Boss was trapped in the glass-walled lift of the atrium after unknowingly consuming several pieces of laxative chocolate.\" \n\"So time was moving slowly for him?\" \n\"Exactly. And this is the interesting thing – and where I think my thesis will shine out – in 'The general theory of relativity of the viscosity of time'.\" \n\"?\" \n\"The viscosity of time is relative to each person. Much like Einstein's work, an observer sees time flow differently than perhaps the subject being observed.\" \n\"Ah – so while for the Boss, trapped in the elevator, time was travelling excruciatingly slowly, for you...\" \n\"...watching the Boss crap his strides rather than be seen dropping a grogan in a glass-wall lift, it was all over too soon. Which leads me to believe that the viscosity of time is affected by several things: Alcohol, Romance, the presence of large sums in untraceable five-pound notes and witnessing the misfortune of someone who truly deserves it – especially someone who has crossed you in the recent past.\" \n\"Really?\" the PFY says dubiously... \n\"Really. And to prove it I've organised a very simple demonstration.\" \n\"Uh-oh.\" \n\"No, this doesn't involve you. Well, not as the subject anyway. I have here a suitcase full of unmarked five-pound notes, a table reserved at the pub and a get-to-know-you drink or 10 organised with the new women from the bookshop across the road.\" \n\"How's that relative?\" \n\"You'll have to wait till we get to the pub...\" \nHalf an hour, three pints and the arrival of our guests later... \n\"And how's it relative?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Right. This >twiddle< is the receiver for a remote camera generally strapped to the underside of a model aeroplane to tape flights. This camera, however, is taped to the front of the Boss's rear-view mirror. Now watch very carefully as I trigger the swapping of the digital inputs of his accelerator and brake pedals...\" \n>click< \n\"Nothing happened,\" The PFY says. \n\"And yet the pub is empty, it's dark outside, our dates and money are gone and it's 12:15am.\" \n\"Incredible!\" \n\"I know.\" \n\"And you can't slow it down any?\" \n\"Not exactly. I have been experimenting with operating systems.\" \n\"Operating systems?\" \n\"Yes, Windows ME and Vista mainly.\" \n\"And they slow time down?\" \n\"Well, time certainly seems slower.\" \n\"So you could install Vista on your workplace machine and it would cancel out the effects of time speeding up when you're enjoying yourself?\" \n\"Except that you would no longer be enjoying yourself...\" \n\"So time would slow down even more than if it were normal time. OS\/2?\" \n\"Yes – Remember the last episode of Sapphire and Steel where they’re trapped in the box in the middle of space... That would be an OS\/2 user – where every day is like the last and every little thing we tried to do would take a millennium.\" \n\"Wow, you could do that to someone?\" \n\"Yes, like the bloke from Security who wheel-clamped me this morning who had an Operating System 'upgrade' this morning. Now before I switch to camera 2 remember that, with the relativity of the viscosity of time the victim would experience time flowing slowly, but to us, the observer, it would travel extremely fast.\" \n\"So the first thing we knew...\" \n\"The terminators would be stalking humans, yes.\" \n\"But still, they're computers and we could reason with them...\" \n\"Yes, I suppose you’re right, it's worth a crack.\" \n>Click< ® \n"}

The company has decided to allocate out \"Professional Development\" funds to key areas of the business to permit a staff member to receive advanced training – with a view to the company becoming a leading edge 21st century business. \n>yawn< \nOrdinarily the prospect of free training has about the same enthusiasm attached to it as the 13th pint at the end of a long night; however my careful reading of the proposal has uncovered some fine print indicating that the funding is approved to cover not only the training but also all incidental expenses. \nA fact the PFY mustn't find out about as it might trigger interoffice rivalry given the Highlander nature of the Development fund. \nA fact the PFY does find out about, triggering interoffice rivalry once the \"can be only one\" nature of the fund is determined. \nBugger. \nSo now the PFY and myself are pitted against each other in a battle of wills – and I can see all the top-flight meals and accommodation, room service and \"study aids\" disappearing from view should I fail. \nI cannot have my incidentals stolen by the PFY in the bid to develop my professionalism by \"Divining the working habits of highly successful IT Professionals\" – a two-week tour of IT workplaces, with nightly networking. \nId est: two solid weeks of drinking. \nOf course, threatening the Boss might work in getting him to see things my way, but if carried too far, the Boss will be in no state to approve the expenditure by the 21st – the purely arbitrary date set by the company. So it's softly-softly approach for now. \n\"Just thought I'd drop you off your cup of tea,\" I say to the Boss, popping into his office, exuding subservience from every pore. \n\"Got one,\" he says, indicating the tea and two choccy biccies at his elbow. \"Your assistant was here before you.\" \n\"Of course he was!\" I respond, not breaking my mental stride. \"I'd asked him to drop it off but then I remembered that he tops off any spillage with saliva, so I thought I'd bring you a fresh one.\" \n\"I. Ah… Yes well, fresh is probably better,\" he nods. \n\"And I see you've got new monitors?\" \n\"Yes, your assistant bought them in a few moments ago. He said he'd got them for me yesterday.\" \n\"Did he?\" I say, recognising the monitors in question as the new 30inch ultraclean monitors that actually did arrive yesterday and were, the last time I saw, attached to my desktop machine. \"So what did you do to upset him?\" \n\"Upset him?\" \n\"Yeah. I mean for him to put them in your office. Did you.. I dunno.. steal something of his? A carpark, his lunch, the new girl in promotions and advertising?\" \n\"I... No. But why would giving me new monitors mean that?\" \n\"Well they're the recalls, aren't they?\" I say, wandering over the Boss's desk, moving the teacups aside and tapping on the front of the monitor carefully. \"Hear that?\" \n\"They're recalls?\" \n\"Yeah, you know, the ones that use depleted uranium pins – for strength. There was a whole documentary about it last week.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yeah. About how the US dumps nuclear waste into Tank-Buster shells to expend on countries that don't let them steal all their assets. So they can steal all their assets. Anyway now that avenue is running out they're using the waste to make super-hard components for various appliances – your monitor included. We tried the monitors for a while but it didn't work out.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"The headaches. Do you get the headaches?\" \n\"What headaches?\" \n\"I get such bad headaches. You know, at night when you're driving a car? I don't know, something to do with the headlights.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"He didn't try and give you a chair did he?\" \n\"No, why?\" \n\"Some of the chairs we got last week were found to have a depleted uranium rod in the pneumatic plunger instead of the normal stainless steel kind – chucking about a kilotoken of radbars per cubit – not at all safe – although saying that they have remarkable results with prostate cancer. There's about 10 of them in the basement, safely behind a few inches of concrete until we can get the hazardous materials people in.\" \n\"I...\" \nOur talk is interrupted by the PFY's arrival – with a new chair. \nMY new chair, as it happens, with the plastic I removed this morning reinstalled on it. \nI take a few strategic steps back to add cred to the \"radiation threat\" idea, while the PFY blunders on oblivious. \n\"You probably don't want to sit on that,\" I caution the Boss. \n\"Why not? There's nothing wrong with it!\" the PFY snaps back. \n\"No, no, of course there's not,\" I say, nodding meaningfully at the Boss. \"Just like there's nothing in your cup of tea but tea.\" \n\"There's not!\" the PFY says grabbing the cup of tea he made for the Boss and chucking it down. \nA few short minutes of argument later and the experimental super strength diuretic in the cup of tea (which must have accidentally got shuffled onto the choccy biccy plate during the monitor tapping incident) takes effect. \nOh, if only in my haste to help the PFY in his hour of need I hadn't snapped the door handle off the inside of the boss's office... \nStill, the PFY will have two weeks to shampoo the carpets while I investigate the professionalism of others. Perhaps I'll bring him back some souvenir coasters. ® \n\n"}

No one could survive for eight months in a tiny crate!\" \n\"Yes, you'll notice I used the word someTHING, not someONE.\" \n\"Uh-oh,\" The PFY says, quietly reaching for Steve's unpacking hammer. \n\"Uh-oh, what?\" Steve and the Boss blurt in unison. \n\"Aaaaaah-Nothing,\" the PFY says. \"I think I left the iron on at home. But you're right, it must have been a break-in ...\" \n\"How bad is it do you think?\" the PFY asks as we ride the lift back to Mission Control. \n\"It depends. If it's just a sleeper bot programmed to murder us all in our sleep in the office, it's bad. If it's a sleeper bot with complete updates of our previous defence strategies programmed to murder us all in our sleep in the office, then it's a little bit worse. But at least we know one thing ...\" \n>PING< \n\"What's that then?\" \n\"It's already in the office,\" I say, pointing at the large hole in our wall, \"and hasn't attacked yet.\" \n\"So it's waiting for something?\" \n\"Or someone.

It must have let itself out.\" \n... Two days later ... \n\"Still nothing?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No.\" \n\"What do you think it's waiting for?\" \n\"The trigger? Who knows. We know it can hear and see, but I suspect it's a combination of voice recognition and a timer. So it'll activate on our voices after it thinks we've been lulled into a false sense of security ...\" \n\"Yes, but where is it???\" \n\"I'm beginning to think it's in disguise. You know – made to look like something else. Something that belongs in our office.\" \n\"So it could be ... anything?\" \n\"Anything less than the size of a half-rack – and probably something new in the office ...\" \n... Half an hour later ... \n\"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?\" the Boss shouts, bursting into Mission Control in a fury. \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Why the hell did you put an axe into the new water cooler?\" \n\"Oh, sorry about that,\" the PFY says. \"I was just showing Simon my backhand when the axe slipped.\" \n\"What, and he was correcting it when HE put an axe into my new wheelie drawers?\" \n\"No, no, I'd removed the axe from the water cooler but the handle was a bit wet and quite slippery and I dropped it.\" \n\"TWICE?\" \n\"Three times actually – I'm a bit of a butterfingers.\" \n\"And that would explain the document shredder too?\" \n\"Uh, no, that was my assistant. He didn't realise how slippery the handle was.\" \n\"The potplants?\" \n\"Ah well, that was a simple misunderstanding. My assistant was just doing his bit for Global warming.\" \n\"How would that stop Global Warming?\" \n\"Oh, are we supposed to be STOPPING Global Warming? Well, it appears we got the complete wrong end of the stick on that one. A nice stick too – used to be a potplant.\" \n... And so it goes. I think the low point came when the PFY claimed he set fire to the Boss's new armchair because he was protesting against animal cruelty, but in the end we managed to placate him by assuring him that he wouldn't come in on Monday to find the place still in disarray. Obviously the second half of that sentence was completely redundant. \nTwenty minutes after he's left Mission Control, I change his password and remote restart his desktop. Five minutes after that he's back. \n\"Oh yes, it's a routine password security feature we activated a couple of days ago,\" The PFY explains. \"If you ignore the 14-days-to-set-your-password warning, it sets it to one of the list of 100 random words.\" \n\"Can't you change it back?\" \n\"System security doesn't permit 2 Administrator-made changes in a day – to stop administrators changing your password hacking into your mail then changing it back,\" the PFY lies. \n\"Oh, I see. Well what are the words?\" \n\"I think I have them on my Dictaphone,\" he replies \n\"What, you don't have a list of them?\" \n\"No, they're in the computer – I read them out off the screen onto the Dictaphone in case I ever got trapped by it and couldn't login to view them.\" \n\"Oh ... I ... see. Can I borrow the Dictaphone then?\" \n\"Sure.\" \nAnd the rest is history. \nWho could have known the successful trigger was Friday Afternoon and the word \"LAGER\" in the PFY's voice? \nTarget Acquired ... \nWho could have known a hitherto insignificant wheelie chair (with a suspicious stain on the seat to discourage occupancy) could sprout a small saw where the backrest used to be? \nWho could have known the PFY was waiting behind the Boss's door with an Axe? \nCamera Fault. >crash!< Mic Fault.

(Pointing out that technology can only do so much doesn't help the situation.) \nAnd so it is that the PFY is helping the Boss with his videoconference call – which of course isn't working because the firewall has dropped a smoking fat one. \nAdmittedly the firewall outage is completely my fault. I foolishly assumed that the latest bugfix firmware from a leading network manufacturer was actually a bug fix and not a bug install – and that the management software which was released with it was actually compatible with the firmware. My mistake! \nAs it happens the Boss's problem ended up being nothing to do with the firewall outage after all, but a fault with his machine. To the casual observer it might have seemed that he'd simply forgotten to plug his cheapie USB camera into the USB socket, but the PFY assured me that there was definitely a fault with the machine. A fault so bad that it actually damaged the Boss's screen. And his wheelie chair. And stole the cash from his wallet – which was left carelessly on the desk just asking for a hardware error. \nTen minutes of feverish activity on the router serial console later (because if you're going to release some buggy firmware that disables the management software, you may as well go the whole way and stuff the SSH server as well), I'm back in Mission Control in time to catch the Boss attempting to swap his monitor with one of ours. \n\"Security bolts,\" I say, pointing to the large hunks of steel drilled through the monitor's plinth. \n\"But you've got three screens!\" the Boss sniffs. \n\"Because we need three screens,\" I counter. \n\"Three screens minimum,\" the PFY adds, putting the spadework in for when we ask for four in a couple of months' time. \n\"Why would you possibly need three?\" he whines. \n\"We have one each for network and server monitoring,\" I say, pointing at the multi-coloured icons on the monitoring screen, \"and two for general work.\" \n\"Surely you could work with two screens – they're big enough!\" \nEven I have to admit the Boss has a point. We do have three of the largest, most expensive panels on the market. If they'd been CRT screens I'd probably be suffering from radiation poisoning by now. But they're not – and I'm not, so it's win-win. \n\"He's not happy,\" I murmur to the PFY as the Boss leaves. \"He'll be annoyed by the time he gets back ...\" \n\"As annoyed as a Beancounter who has had his background picture changed to a still from Planet of the Apes ?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes, but not quite as annoyed as those Beancounters were when someone pepper-sprayed a sack of rats and tossed them into their Friday afternoon drinkies.\" \n\"Oh?\" the PFY says. \"When was that?\" \n\"This afternoon.\" \n\"I ... You mean Friday ...\" \n\"What, and lose the element of surprise?\" \n... One squeaky girly-screamfest afternoon tea later ... \n\"Oooh, now they're really angry!\" the PFY coos happily, looking up from his screen as I rock back into Mission control and toss an empty can of pepperspray in the bin. \n\"Alright who did it?\" the Boss snaps a few minutes later. \n\"Did what now?\" the PFY asks casually. \n\"Threw some rats into the Financials office!\" \n\"Rats? Financials Office?\" I ask. \"We've been trying to source you a new desktop monitor.\" \n\"With an inbuilt camera,\" the PFY adds. \nQuicker than you can say \"Look at the Shiney Shiney,\" the Boss has reprioritised the situation and is helping us look through an online catalogue of PC monitors. \n\"Shouldn't we be investigating this Beancounter thing?\" I ask. \n\"No, no, I'm sure it'll sort itself out,\" the Boss counters without looking away from the PFY's screen. \"Go back to that page with the one with stereo speakers.\" \n\"Isn't that the fire alarm?\" the PFY asks, testing the theory a little further. \n\"No I'm sure it's not. Scroll down a bit.\" \n\"Oooh look. Free chips at the pub with every pint ordered.\" \n\"Well perhaps we could look at this on Monday,\" the Boss says, mincing to the door at 1.2 speed. \nSo it's sorted then. Chips, then new monitor, then possibly death by fire, then angry potentially plague-infested zombie Beancounters. \nIt's good to know where the priorities lie. ® \n"}

Agreed Goals,\" the Boss starts, leafing through last year's review, \"Centralised Licensing Project.\" \n\"Yeah, I never did that.\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"Because of the review.\" \n\"What review?\" \n\"I think you mean 'which review', not 'what'. So there was the review about standard remote workplaces that was supposed to talk about USB security and VPN access but actually talked about monitors and background images, the review of storage policy that wanted to know if we should use the cloud for storage or not, the review about network speed now that all our storage was in the cloud in some third world nation connected at blistering dialup speeds and which probably stores data in wooden platter hard drives because it's carbon neutral, the review about backup strategies and how wood mightn't have been as safe a media as we might have thought in a building fire, and finally the review about workplace safety in the light of the tragic accident that befell the man charged with starting the six former review processes. Then the conversation about the second tragic accident involving the reviewer working on the workplace safety review.\" \n\"So which one was this?\" \n\"Was what?\" \n\"The review that stopped you achieving this goal?\" \n\"Oh, that. Technically it was half a review actually. So we started reviewing our licences and as part of the review process the reviewer guy audited all our printed licence media but tragically fell in front of a Circle line train in rush hour. Well, when I say fell I mean ...\" \n\"... was pushed?\" \n\"I mean we all said it was a tragic 'accident', but he'd been under a lot of pressure recently.\" \n\"I see.\" \n\"And to make things worse, he claimed to have proof that a lot of the licences we'd bought had actually been sold on eBay and that the company was instead running on completely pirated licences!!!\" \n\"And what came of that?\" \n\"Nothing. We gave him the licence documents and I guess the ... shame ... of making such a ludicrous claim ... uh ... drove him over the edge.

No. So you're saying you spent some money improving safety?\" \n\"We certainly did!\" I gasp. \"Let me show you!\" \nThe Weed follows us in to the Server Room and I start pointing out the improvements we've made. \n\"Okay, so just follow me and walk where I walk!\" I say. \n>Crash!< \n\"Are you all right?\" the PFY asks, helping the Weed up. \n\"I...\" he stammered ... \n\"... didn't walk where I walked,\" I finish. \"See, we realised that a lot of the near fatalities in this room are caused by people blundering in to areas that were potentially dangerous – so to prevent this we've installed trips in the raised floor.

So the next one would be 1 as well – and then 2, which would mean *this* one ...\" \n>Crash!< \n\"Yeah, I think you're thinking of the Fibonacci sequence, which is something different altogether. We were talking about the distribution of pepperoni on a pizza at Fabinocci's across the road ...\" \n\"So you mean it's random?

Well, while we're here can we discuss the Halon system?\" \n\"Sure,\" I say. \"What would you like to know?\" \n\"Firstly, why're you still using Halon?\" \n\"Ah, right. The Halon system was in the building when we took it over, designed to flood both levels of the basement area. When the company found out how much it would cost to dispose of the Halon they realised that repurposing it for the server room would be vastly cheaper – as it wasn't technically a new installation. Then, when the Halon was all used up it would be replaced with a different system. See, it turns out that if Halon's discharged in response to an emergency there's no disposal fee or penalty – however if we just vented it to air ...\" \n\"So ...\" \n\"Having fire-based emergencies is the cheapest way to get rid of Halon, yes.\" \n\"I, uh...\" he stammers, lost for words. \"Moving on then. Sixteen incidents involving broken limbs – 12 of which occurred in stairwells.\" \n\"I put that down to panic,\" the PFY says. \"People rushing to stairwells etc – and we recently did something to address that!\" \n\"Really, what?\" \n\"We fitted electrochromic glass in strategic positions in the office. The windows turn opaque during an ... incident – like so >click< – which, in combination with their multiple-glazed noise-deadening construction means that the staff don't witness things which might make them upset or fearful, resulting in a situation of calm.

They only need a ¼ of a turn and they pull out of the cage nut in the back – exposing the bus bars.

But unlike your standard demo, the occupiers rely on the internet to get their message across, provide protection for demonstrators, and to counter the deafening barrage of silence from much of the media – which is such a contrast to the acres of coverage at Tea Party events. \nThe US media only really started to cover the protests about two weeks after they started, after video footage of police teargasing non-violent protestors on Wall Street was broadcast around the world. \nThe videos were up on YouTube within hours, and forced people to recognize that there was a protest going on, with mainstream commentators castigating the police for their attitude. The Register spent Thursday morning chatting with the volunteer admins who maintain the city’s most ad-hoc computer network, to see how they were managing to pull it off. \nThe key problem for the group is power. At present the OccupySF crew is keeping systems running almost entirely on pedal power. A bicycle generator donated by Rock the Bike runs 24\/7, with volunteers usually lasting 30 minutes before handing off to the next fresh set of legs. \nThe electricity thus generated runs into three car batteries to maintain a backup power supply, but the amount of juice that a single bike can generate is only enough to power a single laptop. \nProtestors pedal to power the OccupySF group's communications \nTo deal with the power famine, the protestors have devised some interesting hacks. The batteries are about to be shifted into a dedicated shopping cart, giving the group more mobility. Recent rainstorms have also proved a problem. \nBut with the admins trying to power both phones and batteries, power conversion has become a major issue. The group were having to run a 12 volt supply, convert it to 150 AC and then back down to five volts for phones and the portable radios used to maintain emergency contact. \nThe conversion process is highly inefficient, however, and the admins reckon they were losing over half the available power in the process – power that literally cost blood, sweat, and tears from the peddlers. \nHowever, one bright spark managed to cobble together a new converter that downstepped the 12 volt supply directly to five volts much more efficiently, using mail-order parts and a bit of ingenuity. \n“Another bike generator or two would be really useful,” said one of the admin team. “If we had that we’d be rocking and could build a system that would revolutionize the way these protests work.” \nTo keep the power running, the OccupySF group needs some tools from outside. There’s a crushing shortage of inverters, and more batteries for power storage and dispersal would also be useful, they told us, but the real need is for more computers. \nThe encampment has a rolling population of second-hand netbooks, laptops, and tablets, strung together with ad hoc networking, and carefully power managed. For what some in politics and the media are portraying as feckless dropouts, the protestors are almost religious about saving power: users check their email, slurp some juice into their phones, or post material online, and then shut down as soon as possible to save power for others. \n"}

And the Boss was only at Tier 1...\" \n\"Absolutely. And the sad and pathetic thing is that he did it for something as trivial as a discount on a ride that the company's picking up the bill for - instead of placing a technical product in an effort to get a free one from the manufacturer.\" I respond, moving my iPad 2 into a drawer before the PFY can catch sight of it. \n\"Hey - where did you get that iPad 2?\" the PFY asks. \n\"This?\" I ask, holding the aforementioned pinnacle of design excellence up so that it gleams nicely in the fluorescent light. \n\"Yes. Where did you get it?\" the PFY asks enviously. \"It looks great!\" \n\"It IS great!\" I respond. \"And it's so easy to use with its intuitive touch screen interface!\" \n\"And I bet it has fantastic battery life too?\" the PFY says, looking longingly at it – as most people do. \n\"The battery life IS pleasantly surprising!\" I remark. \n\"But you know what I like?\" the PFY asks. \n\"The 3G connectivity and 64 Gig of internal storage - or the dual core Apple A5 high performance low power processor?\" I ask. \n\"No, I meant my new Alienware M18X!\" the PFY says, pushing me out of the game slightly. \n\"Really?\" I ask. \"Is that the one with the i7 extreme processor and 18.4 inch display?\" \n\"It is – and I think it's great!\" \n\"I'm sure you do – it certainly does sound like extremely good value for gaming money!\" \n\"Uh. I didn't mention the price,\" the PFY says, being new at this. \n\"And nor should you have to. I'm sure that the folks at Alienware - and Apple for that matter - have put vast amounts of work into giving us a superior product at an embarrassingly low price!\" I say. \n\"Yes, yes, I'm sure they have. And who better to optimise products for consumer affordability and product excellence than them?\" the PFY asks. \nOur impartial analysis of current hardware offerings is interrupted by the arrival of the Boss from the position-of-lurk outside the door of Mission Control where he's been quietly observing us for the past several minutes. \n\"Hi guys!\" he gushes, pulling a brochure from out of this briefcase. \"I noticed in our budget planning for the coming months that you've put in a project to replace some of the virtual server platforms with newer gear and thought that this might be a good opportunity to look into getting some of our Intel hardware from an old and trusted supplier.

As a punishment, we have kept all the free iPads and Alienwares for ourselves and given him none. \n"}

Then they start wondering if the change to the font is affecting how quickly Word loads – because that uses fonts too, and it's been slow recently. \nAnd actually, come to think of it they've noticed that there's a warning message when they start Scrabble – and maybe the problem's affecting letters as well as words. \nMaybe it's a virus!!! \nMaybe they should shut their machine down?! \nMaybe they should shut everyone's machine down – to stop the virus spreading?!! \n... \nIt's my own fault really – I should never have suggested memory upgrades. Actually it was the PFY's fault for pointing out that the desktops we were dumping had the same memory as half the desktops we were keeping and so if there were free slots on the keepers we may as well use them. \nOnce Pandora's Box is open though – and it IS open – the nightmare begins. \n\"I'm trying to send you email and it's saying that the address is unknown.\" \n\"You've got the wrong email address,\" the PFY reports, once he's ascertained it's an in-company address. \n\"No, it was working yesterday – before the upgrade,\" the user whines. \n\"Uh, we didn't upgrade your machine,\" the PFY says. \"We only did the HR and Beancounters' machines.\" \n\"Yes, but I'm sending an email to HR!\" \n\"Oh right, you're suggesting that a memory upgrade on their machine makes them disappear from Active Directory.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Well, there's a slight chance,\" the PFY says, \"and by a slight chance I mean about the same slight chance as there is of you being hit in the head by a moon rock after being run down by a dwarf on a tandem while crossing the street.\" \n\"So you don't think it's possible?\" \n\"No. I think it's more probable that you're using the wrong address.

We'll release 6.8 and then realise that we haven't actually got many revisions left before we have to change to 7, so we'll release a 6.81 a 6.83 mandatory service pack, a 6.834 services service pack, a pre-release 7 upgrade verification utility (which will just tell you that your machine isn't capable of running the new software with the current hardware)...\" \n\"I..\" \n\"WE WILL RELEASE VERSION 7, THE CULMINATION OF ALL THE LESSONS LEARNT, ANOTHER COMPLETE REWRITE, but it will run like that guy who won the hotdog eating competition – over a marathon – slow.

Meanwhile we'll look up idiot savants on Google, see if any of them can count matchsticks quickly and see if we can employ them to think outside the box. We have no shame.

Rainfall – its full name being 'Rainfall and the Desert Oasis, Millennium Onward Edition' – will be the penultimate release: it will change the way we do business – or at least that's what we tell people. We will have a launch party with lots of big names. We will tell people that we have already implemented beta releases of Rainfall on phones, tablets, UMPCs, car computers and GPS units. There's even a TV with Rainfall embedded in it, but we're calling that a 'Home Rainfall total immersion experience unit' now.\" \n\"VERSION 10 will have us stuffed. We can't add any more features to the product because the only feature left to add is the function that adds umlauts to every other character – a feature which is needed by no one and serves no purpose whatsoever, but one of the savants suggested it back in Version 7 but we shelved it after we found him eating carpet. No, Version 10 is going to be another one of those change-the-way-we-do-business releases where we make things harder to find but nicer to look at.

A base rod licence will permit you to fish without reel, line, sinkers etc. On dry land, into dirt. You can buy the equipment addons, the streams and rivers addon, the salt water addon which, if purchased with the streams and rivers addon permits you to fish from land into the sea, but not from on a boat into the sea – because that requires the open water licence addon.\" \n\"Why would I buy a salt water licence by itself then?\" \n\"Because you might want to fill your tub with salt water and fish in it. We don't know why you'd want to, but we're sure people do that, and this permits them to do so. Oh, and fishing is a trademark of ours now, as is saltwater, salt, water, streams, rivers, any wavy sign that doesn't look like that of a popular carbonated beverage, etc.\" \n\"But...\" \n\"Of course if you want to keep the fish you catch you'll need a fish acquisition licence, and we have four different levels of this: Personal, Home, Fishing boat and Fishing Company.\" \n\"What's the...\" \n\"It's based on the average daily requirement, so a Fishing Company might be permitted several boatloads, a fishing boat would be permitted a boatload, a home maybe three fish and a personal user ½ a fish\" \n\"½ a fish?\" \n\"Yes, the recommended fish intake for a person says two fish meals a week, so that works out to one every three days or which is ⅓ of a fish a day. We rounded up to ½ because we care.\" \n\"So I'd only be licensed to catch a fish every couple days?\" \n\"No, you'd be licensed to catch ½ a fish a day. Catching a whole fish would be a violation of your licence.\" \n\"So to be within the licence terms I'd have to buy the Home licence.\" \n\"If that's the way you wish to fish yes. But we like to give you options.\" \n\"So I'm licensed to catch and keep fish then?\" \n\"Absolutely.

A 350W unit should do the trick. \n“So no one checked it?” \n“I guess not,” the PFY says, “but I’m pretty sure the testing tag and seal were intact on it. Perhaps you should check with the boss?” \n“Yes, I will, once the aftereffects of smoke inhalation have worn off. Now do you know how the fire in his office started in the first place?”  “I’m not sure,” the PFY says. “He said something about his laptop, so maybe that was it?” \n\"This laptop?\" he asks, holding up a mangled mess of melted plastic, electronics and metal sealed in a large ziplock bag. \n\"It could be, I guess. Though it looks like the fire has pretty much ruined any chance of finding out if the laptop was responsible given its condition.\" \n\"Yes, so I suppose you'd suggest that perhaps the battery had a thermal runaway, which we hear so much about these days, and spontaneously ignited his blotter pad?\" A perfectly believable situation. Far more believable than, say, a small network-addressable incendiary device inside the boss’s “4-port switch”. \n“So if we can go back, did you notice anything unusual beforehand?” \n“Aaaaahhhhmmm, let me think, \" I respond. \" We were in his office about 10 minutes beforehand – we had a meeting about how the overtime rates were being cut from double time to 1.25 time, along with the requirement to work public holidays when requested.” \n“And the meal allowance,” the PFY adds. \n“Yes, that’s right, they dropped the meal allowance for anyone in the office for more than 10 hours in a day.” \n“And I assume that you weren’t too happy about this?” \n“Oh no – I mean these are tough times and the company has to make savings wherever it can,” I sniff. “So we just realised it was for the good of all, and that there comes a time when individual sacrifices need to be made. No doubt those policy recommendations will be adopted once the boss is back from sick leave.” \n“So they weren’t actual policy as yet?” \n“No, not just yet. It was part of some recommendations he was working on. I think he’d suggested all contractors should pay for their car park spaces and lunches as well.” \n“...and?” \n“Well it was all perfectly reasonable. After all, they were struggling to be able to give IT middle management a Christmas bonus and needed to make some savings somewhere – which it looks like they’ve done.” \n\"So it wasn't started by something far less technical - your assistant for instance?\" \n\"Surely not?\" I ask, feigning a lack of knowledge - well, truth be told, I had noticed the pronounced curved scar in the plastic lid debris which can only have been made by a fire axe.  The same type of fire axe the company had removed from the building months ago.  The same type of fire axe that the PFY stole several of prior to the arrival of the removal agents. \n\"I'll think you'll find it was him!\" the H&S geek cries. \n"}

The prospect of holidays ahead always puts people in a good mood which in turn leads to generosity, indulgence and poorly-thought-through dalliances in front of recording devices. \nBut more than that, in the season of goodwill those in the service side of the company get some recognition for the hours of devotion they put in behind the scenes. \nIt's our time. \nAnd so in the spirit of goodwill I send a couple of bottles of whisky to George, our faithful and ancient cleaner - our Alfred, if you will - with a card from the PFY and myself before despatching the PFY get a carton of Christmas puddings for security with so much brandy in them they're probably liable for excise duty... \nYes, on cheery days like today the internal mail typically comes in a trolley or sack barrow as people remember the good service they've had over the past year - not being locked in a toilet over a bank holiday weekend with only paper to eat; not having the lift power cut when they're on their way home; not finding a picture of themselves worrying a sheep in the middle of their PowerPoint presentation to the board, and not slipping on a greased stair in a darkened stairwell.. \nI can't wait. \nI mean I can take the thankless nature of IT - the hours spent in designing an infrastructure that is reliable, redundant and resilient - all things which the punters remain completely oblivious to so long as their Facebook page loads and they're able to tweet their friends about the texture and consistency of their latest grogan, but it IS nice to know that at least one day a year we get something back. It's reassuring to know that if nothing else, browbeating the Boss and board to get dual redundant generators, UPS and switchboards, redundant network core and multiple network feeds has paid off with a bit of Christmas cheer... \nI'm busying myself by clearing a space on a desk to put the incoming contraband on when the Boss interrupts my work with a few last minute concerns. \n\"So what happens if there's a power issue over the break?\" he asks. \n\"The UPS kicks in, the generator starts, the UPS kicks out. Later, the power comes back on the UPS smoothes the transition between supplies and the generators stops.\" \n\"So the power doesn't go off?\" \nIt does, but not to the server room. Or Mission Control. \n\"The espresso machine?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Oh yes. If we're called in to work to resolve a problem we can't be expected to work without refreshment!\" \n\"I.... and so we've done a UPS test?\" \nOr the espresso machine. I add. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And the generator has been serviced?\" \n\"Check!\" \n\"And we have sufficient diesel?\" \n\"Uh-huh. I ordered a couple of drums just in case.\" \nA white lie. Every year I 'order a couple of drums' around Christmas time to pay for the drinks that the PFY consume on the last day. That's the beauty of the purchasing anonymiser service the PFY recently discovered. You select what you want to buy, select what you want it to be billed as, and make your orders. \"2 x 20 gallon drums of diesel\" is ordered and a day later four cases of lager arrive. \n\"So we're all sorted then?\" \n\"Indeed we are. And rest assured that once the internal mail's been here, I'll be checking the breakers on the UPS and generators to make sure they're all ready to go!\" \n\"Uh, the internal mail's already been...\" the Boss says \n\"No it can't have.\" \n\"Yes it did. I got rather a nice bottle of red from security and a box of chocolates from HR.\" \n\"Really? Well, I'd better go and collect our booty!\" I say. \n\"Oh, I've got it here\" the Boss says, handing over a couple of cards. \n>scratchy< >rip< >fumble< \nA couple of empty cards... \nI... am disappointed. \nYes, that's the word, disappointed. \nI mean it's not that I'm completely unprepared for this eventuality - because there might be a later delivery. \n\"Oh, and there's no second internal mail today.\" the Boss says. \nBut people will probably stop by in person... \n\"Are you going to drinks in the cafeteria at 11?\" \n\"Drinks?\" \n\"Oh, did you not get...\" the Boss mumbles, tailing off. \nSo that's how it is then. Slaving away over weekends, offline defragging a mail store so as not to interrupt our users, performing overnight recoveries to get the place back up and running in as short a time as possible... \n>sigh< \nThe Boss leaves and I slowly type in the PFY's cellphone number. \n\"Yep,\" he answers, moment later. \n\"Plan B,\" I say \n\"Really?\" he gasps \"Nothing?\" \n\"A couple of cards.\" \n\"I see. Well I'll be dropping the puddings off in a minute or two.\" \n\"Righty ho.\" \nTrue to his word the PFY drops the puddings off a few minutes later. Plan A called for them to be wrapped in Christmas paper and handed to grateful recipients. Plan B was much the same, the only difference being they were tossed, flaming into the offices concerned. \nThe resulting evacuation provides more than enough time for the PFY and me to rifle through company offices for the Christmas cheer we so sadly missed out on. \nAnd list a couple of generators on eBay... \n"}

Also, he does drink a lot,\" I say \n\"No. I think I should just explain. He was talking about servers.\" \n\"Oh, you mean how manufacturers never standardise on power supplies because they want to screw you over with spares - so a 1000W power supply for one server isn't interchangeable with another server, because while it's the same internally, the plug, size and mounting holes are completely different. Yes, they do love slipping it up your date when you're not looking at the fine print.\" \n\"No. Look, I'm trying to explain. We were talking about maintenance contracts.\" \n\"Oh, you mean how they SAY next business day but don't answer calls after about 3:30pm. And they say \" business hours \" but really mean business hours in Bangladesh or whereever they've outsourced their call centre to. And when they say 'Phone Support' they mean some poor bastard who's never even seen one of the servers, who doesn't know the meaning of the words 'YES, I ALREADY TRIED THAT' and 'I CAN'T RUN DIAGNOSTICS IF IT WON'T POWER UP' and 'WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THE BLOODY OPERATING SYSTEM MAKE IF THE BLOODY SERVER HAS SMOKE POURING OUT THE FRONT OF IT?!\" \n\"No, I mean he was talking about extending our maintenance contract.\" \n\"Now that's a good idea. Extend your maintenance contract – only they won't do it because suddenly all your server hardware is discontinued and only available for already extended service contracts. Then one day you find out that parts are discontinued automatically by the online ordering process and unfortunately the only power supplies they have left are the ones which won't fit into your chassis – but they do have a forklift upgrade option...\" \n\"No it wasn't about power supplies.\" \n\"Good, because that's where they get you. My favourite was the 2+1 supply. You had to have two of three supplies running for the server to stay up. So the one which always smoked out and shorted phase to ground was bloody ALWAYS the phase that you'd unfortunately slapped two plugs into because you only put two phases to each rack,\" I fume. \n\"Yes, well I think perhaps we should probably, uh, talk about this some other time,\" the Boss says, creeping back towards the door... \n\"Don't talk to me about time.

That they have no clue of what the f$*# they’d use it for, but their kids think they’re great and they can’t be stuffed forking out the money themselves for one so they figure the company should just get one and save them the expense. \nBut no. Instead the Boss'll read up on the latest gadget, then drop hints about how his laptop\/cellphone\/PDA\/kindle\/tablet\/home-machine\/desktop-machine\/space-age-watch (all paid for by the company) doesn’t have some particular function – and wouldn’t it be good if there was \"something\" that would coordinate your tie colour with the company’s current stock price (Half-Tea for going down, British Racing Green for holding steady and Royal Blue for on the rise) as well as giving recommendations about how many layers (and what type) of clothes one should be wearing. \nOn and bloody on, until at last some keen-and-green geek on the helldesk will say: “You know I think there’s an iPad app that does that!” and the show begins. Before you know it, the Boss is rabbiting on about how he can’t possibly meet anyone anymore because his tie’s always wrong and before you bloody know it half the other department managers also have a tie-selection problem. Of course you point out that we could write an app that would send him a text message if he liked, but his iPad will have images of ties in case he needs to pick one up on the way to a meeting... \nThen some fuckwit in HR will produce about 10 bloody graphs from some hitherto unknown research company \"proving\" : a) Companies with proactive tie selection tend to do better fiscally b) Tie selection has a 99 per cent chance of engendering a favourable response from first-meeting engagements (failing to mention that the 1 per cent unfavourable time was when the tie concerned was the bright pink penis tie – always a favourite at the company family picnics.) \nOf course no one ever checks this research out to find that the ‘rigorous’ study was undertaken by a rat-eating madman who also publishes horoscopes based on turd divination. \nAnd then there’s the cost. The budget for the company’s 50-odd retail-priced iPads has to come from somewhere... and because everyone from the Boss up feels it’s crucial IT material and so shouldn’t come out of the department’s expense account – and since the Corporate Wasting-Money-on-Pointless-Shit account doesn’t exist – they just raid the IT Budget instead. \nEven this wouldn’t matter if I didn’t know, deep down in my heart of hearts, that I’m going to find half of these devices with about quarter-of-an-hour's worth of use, stuffed into the back of a cupboard with a dead battery three years from now. \nI’ve seen it happen many times. Some crusty from upper management retires, steps in front of a bus (or is helped in front of a bus by a friendly IT professional) and then suddenly a box full of IT detritus turns up in Mission Control in case we \"want it for something\" . \nAnd before I even open the box, I PREDICT I WILL FIND: \nAnd, only three years from now, there’s going to be an iPad in there as well. An iPad and an external Blu-ray drive for reading extra capacity media that no one ever sent him. \nI despair. \n\"So anyway, about this iPad3,\" the Boss says, walking into Mission Control looking confused. \n\"Hmm?\" \n\"I think the screen's broken.\" \n\"No the battery will be flat,\" the PFY proffers. \n\"No, the screen's broken, see?\" \n\"Oh yeah, it is,\" the PFY says \n\"Do we have any spares?\" \n\"No, we ordered as many as we needed.\" \n\"Well I'll need a new one quite quickly - I've got some meetings tomorrow.\" \n>sigh< \n\"Okay,\" I say. \"We don't have any here anymore so you'll have to go with the PFY to a retail outlet.\" \n\"Can't you just get one delivered?\" \n\"We could, but then it won't be here today.

How do I do that?\" \n\"Record a message saying you're a bit out of sorts at the moment, that you're taking medication and that you'll get back to them if you feel up to it. That pretty much covers any illness.\" \n\"Including me appearing to go loony before I throw myself off the top of the building?\" the Boss asks suspiciously. \nHe's good... \n\"Oh puleese!\" the PFY says. \"We have hours of digitised voice for you from the voice recorders. If we wanted to do something like that we'd create a truly awesome message. One about how you can't eat anything but fishburgers since the aliens probed your uterus.\" \nBut the PFY's better... \nAnd just like that the Boss's mind goes into overdrive as he recalls the seemingly odd conversations the PFY has had with him over the phone in the past few weeks. The words \"fishburger\" , \"aliens\" and \"uterus\" have probably made him aware that the PFY was lying when he said he was getting him to 'train Siri to respond to his voice over a landline'... \nIt's almost a shame really - I quite liked this guy. But that's the danger of an underutilised IT professional. \n\"Hey, who wants a pizza?\" the PFY asks, interrupting the Boss's thoughts. \n>tappity tap< >click< \nAs we listen the Boss's voice echoes out of the conference phone, orders two supersize thick crust pizzas with the works – on the Boss's personal credit card. \nTo the wrong address. \n\"Whoopsy,\" the PFY says, making some alterations and ordering another two. \n\"You won't get away with this! I'll call the police!\" \n\"Really – after the call you made this morning where you threatened to shoot the prime minister? In the uterus?\" I ask \n\"I didn't.\" \n\"Oh but you did,\" the PFY says, tapping away on the keyboard furiously, before the Boss's voice echoes out in Mission Control once more. \n>slam< \nI thought the bit about \"Never taking me alive, coppers\" was a bit over the top, but I have to trust the PFY's judgement on this one. \nPartly because he's the expert but mostly because he had me train Siri on my voice this morning... \n>sigh< \n"}

Some idiot in senior management buys a crap bit of software online - with functionality that's already built into Outlook, but is just slightly different - and it has to be installed right now. \nAnd the moment you double-click on the installer you know you're in trouble when it tells you that it's confirming the version of Netscape Navigator you're running. \nThe installation fails of course, possibly because you don't know the correct advanced settings to use, but more likely because it wants you to 'upgrade' to the SE edition of Windows 98. \nYou ring the support line – which you suspect is a pay phone in a minicab office – and they say they'll have to send their expert out – an independent contractor who is the sole support person for this product in the entire UK. And probably drives a minicab part time, because business is so brisk ... \n\"He's going to have a beard,\" the PFY says, as we try and guess the expert they'll be sending over. \n\"Yes, a beard - but not a goatee,\" I concur. \"That would be way too hip for this software. Almost '90s. No, I'm thinking full-on beard, sideburns and mo. And ... a cardigan.\" \n\"And those slacks that have a belt sewn into them with a crest or something on the buckle ...\" the PFY adds. \n\"And ... tan shoes. Drives an immaculately cared-for Ford Granada - Daytona Yellow, if I'm not mistaken - with the protective plastic still on the back seats,\" I add. \n\"That's a little precise isn't it?\" the PFY says. \n\"Not really. He's just pushed the call button on the car park intercom,\" I respond, tapping a picture on my monitor. \n>Minutes later< \n\"Nice Granada!\" the PFY says, almost blowing a circuit breaker on his sarcasm suppression circuits after Gregory introduces himself. GregORY - not Greg. \n\"Thanks. It's the classic Mark 2 model - the same model they used in The Sweeney . I've had it from new!\" \n\"Of course you have.\" \n\"I've had tons of offers on it because of its pristine condition and low mileage,\" our expert burbles. \"Blah blah blah blah blah ...\" \nWhich is why you never engage 'experts' in non-technical conversations ... \n\"So what do you reckon is going wrong with the install?\" I ask. \n\"It'll be a browser incompatibility thing,\" he responds. \"But I've written a plugin for Firefox which replicates all the original functionality of the Netscape Browser. It was quite a job too, because blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah ...\" \nWhich is why you never engage 'experts' in technical conversations ... \n\"Blah blah blah blah blah blah interface,\" he finishes. \n\"Sounds very interesting,\" the PFY lies. \n\"Yes, it turns out that the original HTTP spec had options to blah blah blah blah ...\" \nWhich is why you never say anything that intimates that you might be interested in what 'experts' have to say ... \n\"Blah,\" GregORY adds. \n\"Yes?\" I say, eyes glazing over. \n\"I know it sounds like gobbledygook to you, but to technical people it's really quite ground-breaking,\" he sniffs. \n\"You know we're running hundreds of virtual servers, state-of-the-art distributed Net-RAID clusters, six different versions of Linux, three versions of Windows and have developed our own in-house security and tracking system?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Uh-huh. So if you could just show me where the problem machine is,\" GregORY asks, unrolling one of those flexible rubber keyboards that look so cool in the movies but are such a pain in the arse in real life. \n\"There's already a keyboard on the machine,\" the PFY says. \n\"Ah yes, but this one has been ergonomically adjusted to my hand span,\" he says. \nA quick glance at the keyboard concerned shows that it has indeed seen the business end of a heat gun and a stretching loom, or – taking GregORY into account one more time – a hairdryer and the back of an armchair. \nWhile GregORY sets himself and his USB floppy drive up, the PFY foolishly engages him in some idle chit-chat. \n\"I'm more a Cortina man than the Granada. Lighter frame, which means you can overspec the suspension and shocks, fill the boot and doors with cement and have a vehicle that you never have to worry about in heavy traffic. Sure, you have to be careful going down hills because the brakes are a bit crap, but they're a great ride nonetheless!\" \nI leave as the various merits of the aged Ford stable are discussed at length, returning to find GregORY waxing lyrical about his browser modifications. \n\"So you just rename the browser image file & directory and get it to report that it's Netscape?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"That's it?\" \n\"It's a little more complicated than it sounds,\" GregORY says, more than a little offended. \"It's a lot trickier than changing tapes and looking at CCTV. You could train a monkey to do that.\" \nThe PFY stalks off - which is never a good sign. \n\"I think I offended him,\" GregORY murmurs with a tinge of remorse. \n\"Oh, I wouldn't worry about him, he tends to bounce back,\" I say. \"So tell me about these browser mods?\" \n\"Blah blah blah,\" he replies. \n\"Oh right, I see. That sounds very interesting,\" I mumble. \"BUT WAIT, can you identify THIS mystery sound?\" \nI turn up the volume on my desktop as GregORY listens intently. \n\"I don't know,\" he admits. \"It sounds a little like rubbish bins banging together.\" \n\"COLD.\" \n\"Rubbish bins being emptied? I can hear metal, and glass.\" \n\"STILL COLD.\" \n\"I give up.\" \n\"Well, I'm no 'expert', but doesn't it sound a bit like a cement filled Ford Cortina repeatedly backing into a Daytona Yellow Ford Granada?\" \n\"Gosh,\" I add, flipping the basement car park monitor around. \"You could teach a monkey to drive like that!\" ® \n"}

You know, the ones who can't do anything, don't know anything, but try and cover it up by making a voicemail upgrade project sound as mission critical as faked moon landings. Then there's the Emperor's new verbs and the verbifying of nouns that make it all sound like we're talking space age stuff. I think they may even be paid by the word. \n\"I don't think it's by the word as such,\" the PFY says later when I mention this to him. \"I think they're paid by the proportion of their words to yours.\" \n\"So if I say 10 words?\" \n\"They'd have to say 15. Or 20. Or - let's be honest - 50.\" \n\"Yaaasssss,\" I concur, the shadowy mists of modern-day project management parting in front of me. You know there was a time when a project manager was a bit like the captain of the Titanic , and if the project looked like it was going down the crapper they'd just grab a couple of rolls of four-ply and dive into the hole. \n\"These days though, they tend to be a little more like the captain of the Costa Concordia - not too aware of the size of the crapper they're heading towards until it's too late - but still having enough of an instinct of self-preservation to make sure they step off before the brown stuff arrives.\" \n\"They want to meet me later to 'touch base on some tangential deliverables',\" the PFY adds. \n\"Yes, the boss said he thought this voicemail system upgrade would be a good time to make everyone change their voicemail passwords,\" I answer. \n\"He doesn't know that the old system is completely incompatible with the new one and that a mandatory password change was going to happen anyway?\" \n\"I think we're the only two who know that,\" I say. \"Wouldn't it be tragic if the email server warning everyone of the PIN reset were to disappear down a lift shaft overnight, and the voicemail server defensively locked itself out of the network after receiving 10,000 wrong passwords in under an hour the following morning?\" \n\"I do love a budget system!\" the PFY says. \n\"Yes, we can thank the project managers for that security recommendation too. The whole thing cost a couple of grand - but with the PM fees and the cost of getting the voice prompts translated into English the bill should be no less than 20k - twice the price of the one we proposed.\" \n\"And his one is open source,\" the PFY says, echoing the Boss's main reason for going with the PM crowd. \n\"When's the next meeting?\" I ask. \n\"Meetings, I think you'll find. We've got 'pre-implementation phase planning' 2 till 3, 'contingent implementation timelining' 3 till 4, and 'post implementation evaluation procedural steps' 4 till 5.\" \nGasp! \n\"So by looking at this cross complimentary overview matrix we can see that the implementation thread management shows a major task concurrency at these three points which will require retasking of the experience support personnel to offload the feedback burden,\" the head PM blathers. \n\"So what you're saying is that when we make the change we'll both be too busy to take user enquiries?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, but the divisional compatibility matrix we showed you earlier identifies that the project lacks the key skill matrix requirements to assume that role, so we'd need to task that to a specialised services resource provider.\" \nI look over and see the Boss is just eating this crap up. \n\"You're going to get contractors in to answer the phone and tell people that voicemail will be back in a few hours?\" I gasp. \"In the middle of the night, when no one's going to be calling about their voicemail anyway?!\" \n\"We're being paid to manage this process from start to completion with no negative outcome events.\" \n\"Okay, I have a counter proposal for you. How about my assistant and I streamline the Project Management process by strategically engaging some recreational projectile modifiers amongst the current Project Management resource?\" \n\"I think he's talking about hitting us with a bat of some sort,\" the lead PM murmurs to the Boss. \n\"..then implement an incentive-based contract revision process in a building resource free of distraction,\" I add. \n\"…torturing us in a basement,\" he translated. \n\"and round off the project by getting my assistant to reenergise the unusable resources at a non- strategic site resource,\" I conclude. \n\"..and then burn our bodies on some wasteland.\" \n\"Or you could just fork off now and we'll implement the server we were going to in the first place.\" \n\"I don't think...\" the Boss starts. \n\"Now where did all this cricket gear come from?\" the PFY asks, pulling a large bag out from under the desk. \nAnd just like that, the project is back on track! \n"}

Not that any of our toilets actually have an automatic cleaning cycle, but it's impressive what you can improvise with a hole saw, a gallon pail of degreaser and a firehose while PFY's got a screwdriver jammed in the \"Vacant\/Engaged\" keyway... \nIn any case, the new Boss is NOT a technical manager. Despite an \"extensive career encompassing all areas of IT\" (according to his CV) he barely has the technical wherewithal to interact with a parking meter. \nWhich leads to his favourite things: diagrams and KPIs. If you're going to lose sight of the underlying business then you may as well have some nice charts to keep you company, and this is where we come in. For instance, I tell him we're going to the local curry house for a team-building exercise and he'll ask me to whip up a quick diagram of who's going, what they'll do when they get there, how it will affect morale, and then ask for some KPIs to measure whether the whole thing was a success. \nBy the time we're halfway through giving ourselves vindaloo and lager poisoning, the Boss will have a Visio diagram and Microsoft Project document prepared, along with an Excel spreadsheet and graphs plotting Morale v Course, with X-Axis values of Pre-Meal, Pre-Meal-Drinks, Entre, Pre-Main Course Drinks, Main Course, Post-Main Course Drinks, Dessert, Post Dessert Drinks, One-for-the-road Drinks, Every-Pub-on-the-way-back-to-work drinks and finally Post-Meal drinks. \nUsing the Excel prowess he got from having someone read Excel for Idiots to him, he will interpret the trend line of the above graph, realise that Morale reaches a peak at the point just after Post-Main drinks and just before people realise that they're going to have to go back to work when this is all over. \nWe'll have a meeting about it where he will present his findings and then have a round-table discussion about how we might achieve the same morale boost without the lager and someone taking a dump in the pot plant inside the company foyer... \n\"Okay, so this box is our site, the box inside it is the area protected by our firewall,\" I say. \"The box inside that represents our domain and these lines represent the types of connection we will let through. Think of it like if we wanted to let someone outside the company phone you or send you snail mail, but prevent them from emailing you – whereas we don't mind what people inside the company do.\" \n\"I'm not sure I'm with you. Perhaps you could use some different-coloured pens.\" \nYep, different-coloured pens will crack this baby... \n\"How about I try?\" the PFY asks, pulling up a chair, grabbing some sheets of paper. \"These boxes here represent the phones in this building.\" \n\"There's more phones than four in the building...\" \n\"Yes, but see there's a dot-dot-dot and a gap between the third and fourth box? That's so I don't have to draw 300+ boxes.\" \n\"Ah.\" \n\"So maybe we want to allow people to phone in for a financial reason to the company - so we let calls come in to any of the finance people, but block calls coming in to the rest of the company.\" \n\"I think I got a call yesterday,\" The boss chips in. \n\"Yes but this is an analogy,\" The PFY says testily. \nThe PFY's first mistake was in getting involved in the discussion when he didn't need to. The second, and larger, mistake was adding an analogy to someone who is patently overanalogised. It's a bit like flushing a blocked toilet – you think the extra water might help clear things out, but in reality you just end up dealing with someone else's crap. \nI sit an wait patiently while the PFY pulls the proverbial chain another couple of times. \n\"Ok, say you lived in a house with 300 entrances.\" \n\"That would be a castle, not a house, surely?\" \n\"Okay, what about a maze with 300 entrances.\" \n\"Why would I live in a maze?\" \n\"I didn't say you LIVED in a maze, I SAID what if there WAS a maze.\" \n\"No, I think...\" \n\"Perhaps I could help,\" I say, directing the collective view at some documents I've hastily tapped into the Boss's computer. \"I've just typed up a rough outline of the K-Project, which I fear is about to be triggered.\" \n\"The K Project?\" \n\"Yes, the K Project. Here's a Gantt chart outlining the timing of the major steps. You will note that the tasks 'Anonymous purchase of a 40lb bag of quicklime', 'Location of a roll of carpet & shovel' and 'Identification of a landfill destined to remain untouched for 40 years' are already marked as 100 per cent complete...\" \n\"Ah,\" the Boss gulps. \"What are you suggesting?\" \n\"I'm suggesting we instead activate project L.\" \n\"Project L?\" \n\"Yes, that's your project, so I'll let you take the keyboard. >shuffle< Okay, so if you go New Project and in the resources I want to add your name.\" \n\"Yes. And?\" \n\"AND, that's it.\" \n\"But I'm not doing anything.\" \n\"Precisely. Actually, create a new task called 'Sign anything put in front of you', assign 100 per cent of yourself to that task and make the length 365 days.\" \n\"Then what?\" \n\"Then, when 365 days expires, extend it for another 365 days. If it helps, put a line in for Project K and make it's Predecessor Project L. So Project K starts when Project L stops...\" \n\"I'm not sure I follow.\" \n\"I didn't think you would, which is why I prepared this Excel graph >clickety< of your life expectancy against the PFY's annoyance level. I suspect we're at this point on the graph, and you'll see that we're very near the point where the plot line crosses the X-Axis. Activating the K project.\" \n\"100 per cent of my time to Project L you say?\" the Boss says. \nWho says I can't use diagrams to explain things... \n"}

UPS failure,\" the PFY says calmly, glancing up from his monitor briefly. \n\"Well aren't you going to do anything about it?\" \n\"I am,\" he responds. \"I have to shut down everything on the working UPS units so that I can synchronise and start everything up again from scratch. If I just bypass the broken UPS there'll be all sorts of problems.\" \nWhich, on the Pinocchio scale of lies, is a sixteen-foot piece of dowel with some nostrils cut in the end. The only true thing the PFY said is that there is a UPS failure... \n\"What sort of problems?\" the Boss snaps back. \n\"Well the server-client systems will be all out of whack for a start but the replication of data is bound to fall over - then there's the electrical problems - phase imbalances, hysteresis loops, the possibility of brown-outs and spikes, not to mention the power factor correction that we'd need to put in place.\" \nUtter bollocks. None of the crap is going to happen and the PFY knows it. In actual fact, all that's happened is a cheap UPS in a comms cupboard two floors above us has failed, and instead of failing into bypass – like any reputable UPS that you paid more than three shiny beads for – it just turned off. \nAll because the Boss, in his wisdom, decided that instead of \"wasting\" all that money upgrading the UPS feed from the server room to the comms risers for the increased POE switch demands, he'd simply order some standalone UPS units for every comms room in the building. \nAnd so it was that a box of 20 3KVA UPS units arrived late last week. \nThat's right, a box, not a pallet. That's the first concern. Your average 3KVA UPS weighs enough to have the courier driver dousing himself in Brut 33 before attempting to haul it out of the back of his van, but the whole boxlot of these babies was easily wheeled into Mission Control on a sack barrow. They've probably got the life expectancy of a box of chocolates at a Weightwatchers weigh-in. \nOne of my personal warning signs on gear is when I get a brand name the same as the device – ie, with this UPS brand UPS from UPS Ltd, I'm fairly sure I'm in trouble. Perusing the copious documentation (a sheet of badly photocopied paper in poorly worded English warning me about supplying the connector of the utility in the reversal format), I note the complete lack of company name, model number or service information. \nThis should be good. \n... \nWhere your average UPS would have bar graphs to indicate battery capacity and load, this one appears to have a bulb behind a piece of green plastic with boxes crudely stencilled on it. \nThe supply transiting operator (power switch) had just the sort of tactile response you'd expect from a thin piece of plastic breaking under finger pressure as the device fired up (without the fire, surprisingly). \nAnd they were installed. \nIt was only later that the PFY that discovered that if you liven up the network monitoring port from a PoE switch, the thing would overheat and crap out in about five minutes... \nIt's probably a design feature. \n\"Well what are you going to do meantime? We're trying to give a presentation to the board! It's very important!\" \n\"I know it is,\" The PFY says. \"You told me that three days ago and so I've made all the infrastructure you need super-reliable by putting UPS units inline for all the gear. There's one in the ceiling powering the datashow, one at the distribution switch, one on the fibre transceiver and even one on the fridge that's keeping the drinks cool - although according to nagios that one stopped responding late last night.\" \n\"Which one is broken now?\" \n\"When you say now do you mean now or 10 minutes ago when you were in the boardroom? >clickety<\" the PFY asks. \n\"I... 10 minutes ago.\" \n\"That would be the UPS on the distribution switch.\" \n\"And... what.. about now?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Ah, well, the Datashow one stopped responding about a minute ago.\" \n\"Damn it!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"Everything on the 6th floor is working OK if you wanted to move everyone up there?\" the PFY suggests. \"You could put get them to meet you up there while I put your presentation on a USB stick.\" \n\"Yes! Yes, let's do that.\" \nThe Boss makes a quick call to the 4th floor boardroom while the PFY drags some mundane PowerPoint files onto a USB drive. \n\"Right, 6th floor!\" the Boss says, dashing for the door. \n\"Oh there's no hurry,\" the PFY says. \n\"No hurry? Why?\" \n\"It looks like the UPS unit on the lift controls has stopped responding so it will have stopped. Looks like it's in between 4 and 5.\" \n\"WHY THE F*** DID YOU PUT A UPS UNIT ON THE BLOODY LIFT CONTROLS!!!?!?\" \n\"Because the lift is critical infrastructure. You wouldn't want the lift stopping between floors because of a panel failure and trapping someone in there. Especially between 4&5, because the 5th floor door has the broken emergency access lever so they'd have to put a ladder down from 6 to get the board members out.\" \n\"Can't you put it in bypass?\" \n\"Yes, well, I tried that on the one that failed yesterday but the unit just started smoking and an orange Ghostbusters light came on. Besides, it's on the roof of the lift car and that's stuck between 4&5 and I'd need a ladder to get to it...\" \n\"Ffffff...!\" the Boss blurts again, dashing to the door Mission Control \n\"So the lift really is stuck?\" I ask. \n\"Oh yeah, It's as stuck and the automatic door release on our d... >crash< ..oor,\" the PFY says, and the Boss slumps to the floor. \n\"Yeeeeeessss,\" the PFY continues, firing up the console port of the basement distribution switch. \"We're about 12 power inline static max commands away from a complete building shutdown.\" \n\"Time is awasting!\" I yell, noticing the impending approach of lager o'clock. \n>clickety!< ® \n"}

As far as poorly thought-out pickup techniques this one has far outlasted his patience. The moment an orange light goes on, the whirring noise gets a little louder or someone suggests the air is a little bit 'ozoney' (my personal favourite) she's down here like a shot to give the PFY a heads-up. \nCourse after the first 20 visits the PFY latched onto the old faithful leave-me-alone excuse of: \"Yes, I'm actively monitoring that with SNMP traps\" , but that didn't help because she could still beat a non-existent SNMP monitor to Mission Control, so then she started helping with the diagnosis of the SNMP fault. (ie, \"Loose wire?\" , \"No network?\" , \"Wrong type of paper loaded?\" ). \nThis would all fade into irrelevance except that she's also communicated our interest in the state of printers in general to the rest of the staff, who have now started emailing us about the state of their printers. \nAnd let's face it, the quality of a printer is inversely proportional to it's distance from organisational power. So while the CEO has multicolour production quality monstrosity which can fax, scan, staple, bind, double side, laminate and make coffee, your average beancounter's 'laser' printer is an inkjet device which starts losing print registration about halfway through the original colour cartridge. And we'll make the poor bastard use it for three years before we replace it. (Again, as opposed to the CEO's printing unit which will be upgraded to the new model moments after he's printed the latest brochure about it. (single-sided, greyscale, unbound, unlaminated, unstapled and he'll get his PA to make a coffee). \nSo anyway, the Inbox at Mission Control is getting a little swamped with helpful observations about printing idiosyncrasies. So much so that I append another bullet point to the Company's anti-spam policy and direct emailers to it. \nThe Director's printer, though, is a whole different kettle of rats. It's going to have to be fixed. Luckily that printer is a per-page rental unit, complete with management card which allows it to communicate errors, printer status, toner levels and waster toner levels to the printer company so that they can ship new consumables and engineers as needed. \nThat said, the PFY and I have started to suspect that the management interface concerned is simply a randomly blinking LED and that the printing company just ships toner cartridges at us every month or so and bills us some large amounts of pages. Whatever it's doing, the engineer only turns up when you call them... \n\"It's a driver problem,\" he says, pulling a crumpled piece of A3 out of the guts of the printer. \n\"It's NOT a driver problem,\" the PFY responds tersely. \n\"Yeah, it is. If they update their driver it'll sort it out.\" \nI bloody hate talking to printer engineers. \n\"HOW can it be a bloody driver problem?\" the PFY asks. \"It only jams on A3.\" \n\"Oh. It's probably a humidity problem - your paper will be too damp. It curls,\" he responds. \n\"No, we tried that - we got new paper, put it straight in, and it jammed,\" the PFY lies \n\"Oh. Well it's a driver problem.\" \n\"IT'S NOT A F***ING DRIVER PROBLEM!\" the PFY says, losing his rag. \n\"Look,\" the engineer says, tapping in the secret code that they only use for maintenance and pulling 'chicks'. Sad, sad 'chicks' who are impressed by photocopier stories. \n>bip< >bip< >bip< >whirrrrrrrrrrrr<. \n\"See, perfect,\" he says, holding up an A3 test page. \"And if you go Print a Test Page from your printer it'll work too. Just not this printout - because it's a driver problem.\" \n\"How can it possibly be a driver problem?\" I ask. \n\"Well,\" he says, looking around carefully in case undercover agents from another printer company (did I already say \"sad, sad 'chicks'\" ?) is listening in. \"There's a 10 mil margin around the page that you can't print into, because the printer was designed around the Egyptian A3 standard.\" \n\"The Egyptian A3 standard?\" \n\"Yes!\" he replies with thinly disguised disgust. \"The Egyptians invented paper - and the paper standards. The Egyptian A3 standard is slightly smaller than the common A3 standard - because it's metric.\" \n\"Have you ever heard the phrase: 'Don't bullshit a bullshitter?' I ask, pulling out the cattleprod with a newly upgraded inverter.\" \n\"I... What's that?\" our engineer asks nervously. \n\"This? This is a management interface. You plug it in and push the button and you get told the state of things. Admittedly it's not guaranteed to work first time, but after four or five goes it usually pays for itself. Or someone pays you to stop using it. Either way, it's money well spent.\" \n\"It's a driver problem!\" he whines \"NO! WAIT! If you update the driver the pages will print!!!\" \n\"Somehow I don't think I'm getting the full story...\" I hint. \n\"It... Chops the top off your pages.\" he blurts. \"It's a design fault - the feeder pages are too near the toner deposition and so the page skews if you print too close to the edge. If you upgrade the driver it'll chop the top and bottom of your page off and print OK.\" \n\"Finally, the truth!\" the PFY says. \"So you'll be replacing the printer with one that works?\" \n\"Yes, yes of course. But you'd have to sign up for another two-year term. And...\" \n\"And?\" \n\"You'd need to stock up on some Chinese standard A4. The latest printer uses the Chinese A4 standard. After all, they were the first people to use wood derived paper and they set the original standard for A >KZZZZEEERRRRRT<\" \n\"Wow!\" I say as the PFY and I help the engineer back into his van a few minutes later. \"That prod is getting bloody warm. Do you think it's a driver problem?\" \n\"No... THAT,\" the PFY says moments later as the van mounts the pavement and stops halfway into a bollard \"is a driver problem\" . ® \n"}

People want us to bend the rules.\" \n\"But it's just some letters!\" the Boss replies, feigning reasonableness, if there is such a word - and as if it could be applied to the Boss anyway. \n\"And there's the tell-tale sign!\" I snap, beating the PFY to THAT exclamation by nanoseconds. \n\"The.. tell-tale sign?\" \n\"Yep. The word 'JUST'. By using it you assume that what you're asking for is a reasonable request - a couple of simple clicks of the mouse, a tap on the keyboard, and everything's hunky-dory. But it's bloody not!\" \n\"But look, isn't changing the password strength rules for one chap just a couple of clicks?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Of course it is, but that's not the point,\" I say. \"You do that and it affects the security of the entire domain. A longer password makes it unlikely that someone will use their initials twice. Forcing them to use at least one number stops them from just using a plain password, and forcing them to use at least one letter stops them from using their home phone number. But it's not about the password, it's about domain security.\" \n\"Could you just make an exception for them?\" the Boss asks. \n\"You did it again,\" the PFY observes. \n\"Did what?\" \n\"Used the word 'just'. Remember, if the word 'just' is in a sentence it's an unreasonable request. And we don't make exceptions.\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"BECAUSE EVERYONE'S A BLOODY EXCEPTION!\" \n\"You said that, but what does it mean?\" \n\"Look, I change one guy's password complexity and the next thing I know someone else will want me to change their password complexity.\" \n\"But this is a special case!\" \n\"THEY'RE ALL SPECIAL CASES!\" the PFY SHOUTS. \n\"What my assistant is trying to communicate,\" I say in calm tones, \"is that if I make an exception for this bloke some other basket case will want me to change their password complexity - for a reason they think is a special case too - like they're allergic to using number keys or they've got some special-needs keyboard that makes it harder to use the shift key. Then the next person will come in saying that they can't mix upper and lower case on religious grounds and before we know it the only password people will be able to use is 'A'.\" \n\"Or Enter,\" the PFY says. \n\"I don't..\" starts the Boss. \n\"Then we'll get some dorky bean counter who wants us to increase the size limit on email messages - JUST for a day - to 50MB so he can send some work home. Only he'll want it again next month and the month after that, and twice in March and April, and then comes the inevitable question: why don't we just leave it at 50MB because he needs it after hours too?\" \n\"Is it that unreasonable?\" the Boss asks quietly. \n\"Yes, it is. It never sounds unreasonable at first, but the mess it causes is.\" \n\"I still don..\" \nLet me tell you about access control. We have divisional groups, departmental groups and project groups. We have folders on our file-share machine with hierarchical access control based on those groups. And then we have someone who isn't in any group because he's a contractor. And he's only supposed to have access to one file buried in the hierarchy of files. \nThen there's another file in a completely different location. And another. Then he leaves, but he might come back, but no one knows when and so we make an exception for that special case and leave his account open without disabling or expiring it. \nThe department head concerned says he'll let me know when the access can stop. Then the guy doesn't come back but another contractor does, and he needs access to different files, all in different places - but not the same files. \nThen the original guy comes back - but now he needs write access to files. And web access to our internal portal - but only certain parts. And he's using an iPad with a shite implementation of Excel, and they need him to be able to synchronise his spreadsheet with the data in one of those files he has access to... through Dropbox - but only on the day before the close of accounts for the month. \n\"And then the second guy needs the same thing, but he can't use Dropbox because his firewall won't let him because, oh I don't know, it's green and not a black firewall. And he's got three cables coming out of his box, so anyway if we could just give him FTP access to the server then that would be grand. The department head who originally authorised this left six months ago and no one really knows if the first guy's still working for us or not, but he should probably still have access just in case. THAT IS WHAT EXCEPTIONS ARE!\" \n\"Yes, yes, I see your point, but really this is just about one person's password-\" >kzerrt!< \n\"That was just a bit of voltage,\" I say. \"This is just a roll of old carpet. This is just a spade and those are just bags of lime. This is just a map of abandoned forest trails with vehicle access.

Your RAM craps out and the corresponding LED lights up on the front panel. Everyone loved them until they found out you had to disconnect the front panel to open the lid. The lamps would go out and then you'd realise that the front panel LEDs were numbered 1 to 8 whilst the RAM modules were labelled A1 to A4 and B1 to B4, so then you'd have to guess whether faulty module 5 was module B1 or A3.

It doesn't have to boot from the new firmware, it just has to have it on board.\" \n\"Can't we just disconnect the cable so that the UPS thinks it's standalone?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"No, it's in a cluster.\" \n\"Can't we uncluster it?\" \n\"Sure, we can do that from the interface once it's booted.\" \n\"So... we're going to have to update the other UPS - but NOT reboot it?\" \n\"Yes, it's just a patch, not a restart.\" \n... Five minutes later ... \n\"And this,\" the PFY says to the Boss, \"is what silence is like.

With only the annoyance of finding another job moderating the PFY in the past, he's now completely off the leash. \n\"What?\" the PFY echoes. \n\"She didn't give me a disease!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"Oh, what then?\" \n\"I got an IPAD Mini!\" the Boss screeches. \n\"I thought you said it wasn't a disease?\" the PFY says. \n\"What?\" \n\"What?\" \nThis could get ugly... \n\"It's a Mini!\" the Boss says. \"It's like an iPad but not as bulky.\" \n\"Oh yeah,\" The PFY says \"I looked at one of those but it's still a bit large for me.\" \n\"A bit large?\" \n\"Yeah, I wanted something a bit more portable - with a bit more functionality. I got an iPad Micro.\" \n\"An iPad Micro?!\" the Boss asks casually, showing all the signs of device envy. \n\"Yes - smaller and more convenient.\" \n\"Really? Did it cost much?\" the Boss asks \n\"Nah, not really - on a par with similar devices.\" \n\"Should we... uh.. get one in to review them?\" the Boss suggests, then realises that it would be seen for the deliberate toy-grab that it is. \"Perhaps get several - one for all the staff. We're well under the budget forecast for this quarter so you may as well order a bunch of them.\" \n\"Which model do you want?\" \n\"I... Uh... Whatever's the cheapest,\" the Boss says, feigning nonchalance \nAnd so it is that the PFY orders 10 iPhones... \n\"But they cost nothing!\" the PFY tells the Boss the next day. \n\"They're not iPad Micros at all!\" the Boss shouts angrily. \"They're just iPhones!\" \n\"Well *I* call them iPad Micros,\" the PFY responds defensively \"They're smaller than iPads and have more functionality. You can even make phone calls on them!\" \n... \n\"Well he's not at all happy!\" I say as the Boss storms out. \"Imagine how unhappy he'll be when he finds out you signed up for an extortionate 36-month term because it was the cheapest option!\" \n\"Not half as unhappy he's going to be when he finds out I bought them with East European SIMs and the data roaming charges for the UK kick in at the end of the month!!!\" \n\"Yes, it's a pity he's not on our contract isn't it?\" \n\"Perhaps we should start sending him whiskey-bottled shaped packages.\" the PFY hints. \n\"Or just leave the empties in his rubbish bin.\" ® \n"}
{"Date":1361491200000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2013\/02\/22\/","Title":"BOFH: Climb the corp ladder - and use your boss as a bullet shield","Link":"\/2013\/02\/22\/bofh_2013_episode_1\/","Content":"Episode 1 \"It's like progress bars,\" I say to the PFY during a discussion about the relative merits of the company management as we ride the lift to the CEO's office to fix some laptop crisis. \n\"All too often the bar itself bears no relationship whatsoever to the amount of time you're going to wait. In the same way the salary of a manager in this company has no connection with their worth.\" \n\"You mean like when it says there are 13 minutes left for the install time but in reality there are either 7 or 34?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes, but in terms of salaries,\" I reply. \"See salaries are linked to an organisational chart, so what the HR beancounters like to see is that everyone on the same tier gets paid roughly the same money - within a range.\" \n\"So if I wanted to earn more money..?\" \n\"You would take another job. Or, within this company, you would need to do two things: A. Move your immediate boss up the organisational chart, and B. Change your job description somewhat to introduce an element of doubt into your work.\" \n\"I'm not following you on the second bit,\" he says. \nOK, so you've grasped the bit about cleaning up the organisational chart - which is basically get a bunch of middle management axed in the name of greater productivity, reorganising working teams for greater efficiency, or enhancing interoffice synergies to reduce operating costs - you know, any old shit that sounds great when it's read out at an unfair dismissal hearing. So now you've got a director at tier 3 who reports to the Board at tier 2 with the CEO at tier 1. \n\"You're tier 8, say, because the company had more chiefs than Indians, but now there's nothing between you and tier 3. You will be sucked into the void, along with all the other tier 8s and before you know it he'll be looking for someone to manage the tier 8s. A better idea is to preserve the person above you - if they're not a complete air-thief - and clean out the rest. A quick organisational defrag and your boss is tier 4 and you're tier 5.\" \n\"Yes, but that still doesn't explain..\" \n\"The second bit: you have to enhance your job title to a point that HR have no idea what you should be paid before they'll accept you at tier 5.\" \n\"No, you lost me,\" the PFY blinks. \nOK so you're the guy that replaces the toilet lollies and bog rolls every night and you suddenly get defragged 4 levels up the food chain. They'll still only pay you at level 12 rates because you're doing a level 12 job. What you need to do is change your job to one of those fancy schmancy ones so that HR has no idea what you actually do. \n\"You construct a 10 page position description full of Key Performance Indicators - or even more pathetic, Key Success Indicators - or you can generate your own special terms by picking one word from these 3 groups and putting them together: Essential, Directed, Measurable; Vision, Service, Delivery; Targets, Metrics, Outcomes, and before you know it your role is described in terms of Directed Delivery Metrics.\" \n\"But what does that mean?\" \nNothing, that's the point. And the other thing you do is go wide and abstract - never actually describing anything in any detail. 'Sanitation engineer' is barely sufficient to get you up a single tier because everyone sees it for the euphemism it is. You don't work in the fields of hygiene, disinfectant or porcelain skid marks - you're level 5 material now! You're the Corporate Holistic Wellness Coordinator - responsible for the on-going delivery of wellness in the workplace. Your 'measurable vision metrics' are tied to workplace attendance which you can fake by offering sickies a free bowl of chips for breakfast on a Monday morning. \n\"Sure, they'll die of heart disease sooner, but by then you'll be another tier up the ladder and it'll be someone else's problem. Speaking of which - because no one knows what the hell it is you do, you'll find that you have a stack of tier 9 to 12s suddenly working for you. You'll let a few of the lazy ones go to give the impression you know what the hell it is they do, but really you're just killing time till you're found out - which you can put off for years.\" \n\"Uh... so how does this help me?\" asks the PFY. \n\"Well say there was a big defrag in IT management. You'll want to have a tier 6, say, job, because obviously I'd want a tier 5 job and who needs the hassle? We'll keep the Boss because he has no idea how his mobile phone works, let alone how we do. We write him a primo Job Description, write ourselves something similarly bewildering, and then... slip into the hole. You'll want to think of a JD with the word Architect in it. They bloody love that word these days - and it's not like the old days when you had to eat pencils or have a goatee. Solutions Architect is maybe a tier 7 at best, but a Corporate IT Integration architect is a 6. Workplace Systems Architect is a 5 and before you know it you'd have half the beancounters working for you.\" \n\"So according to your plan I'd be on the same level as a beancounter.\" \n\"Good point, the boss would have to go as well,\" I say tapping on the CEO's door. \nTwo minutes later the CEO's problem is found - the adapter wasn't plugged in and he missed all the warning messages about battery remaining. \n\"It's not your fault,\" I say to the CEO. \"I've recommended making those warning messages bigger for months now but it looks like all the good ideas filtered out by management.\" \n\"Good ideas? Like what?\" asks the big man. \n\"Well I suggested one about your laptop saying good morning to you when you start up - but also saying good afternoon and evening to you, depending on what time it was.\" \n\"Really? It could do that?\" the CEO gasps while grasping onto an idea so appalling the PFY is probably going to punch me in the face on the way back down in the lift - except that I happened to hear the CEO burbling about the very same thing at lunch a couple of weeks back. \n\"Of course. I suggested it but apparently someone above me thought it was a stupid and dumb idea that only a cretin would think of. But I think it's a great plan. We could roll it out through all the company machines!\" \n\"It's a shame how all those middlemen get in the way of things that could make our company great,\" the PFY sighs. \nVIVE LA REVOLUTION! ® \n"}

Not. \n\"Uh, the abandoned call and unanswered calls numbers. They're really quite worrying.\" \n\"Why do they worry you?\" the PFY asks, in a thoughtful and engaged manner that could only be enhanced by the presence of a pipe and a comfy couch. \n\"Because they reflect badly on the department,\" the Boss says. \"Our department average for abandoned calls was 8 per cent, but with you two included is 37 per cent and our unanswered called were 11 per cent but are now 51 per cent!\" \n\"I think the reflection's all about how the figures are presented,\" I say. \"Perhaps you should take a leaf from the Health System's book and instead of using a phrase like 'People who died on the waiting list for an operation' use 'People whose date of death preceded their date of operation'.\" \n\"How's that different?\" he asks. \n\"Because in the first case the onus is on the health system for not getting the person to an op, but the second case is definitely the patient's fault for choosing to die before they could be operated on,\" I reply. \n\"I'm not sure I'm with you.\" \n\"Why not title columns 'Calls where the user solved the problem before needing technical attention' instead of abandoned calls, and 'Calls where users were given the option to seek an alternative solution' instead of calls we didn't answer?\" \n\"Yeah, I don't think that would work. It's a bit transparent,\" the Boss sniffs. \n\"Only if you look carefully - and no one does that with statistics,\" I respond. \"Anyway, what's the margin of error?\" \n\"What?\" \n\"The margin of error. You know, like when they take a phone poll and tell you how accurate it is. It could be that the margin of error is so high in these stats that we're actually doing a bloody good job.\" \n\"You're not, and no one cares about the bloody margin of error, they only worry about the numbers. I think we should just try to improve our service,\" the Boss snaps. \n\"You say that now, but I know you'll be back in a week with more problems...\" \n[FLASH FORWARD TO ONE WEEK AGO] \n\"Yes, but I thought you were actually going to do something about the numbers?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I did,\" I confirm. \n\"Changing all the row names doesn't help,\" the Boss barks. \"Changing a row to 'calls abandoned when the user realised they were being a slack lazy bastard who should have done what they were told two weeks ago' doesn't help. Nor does 'calls where the user had insufficient information available to make a successful support call because the internet is running slow is a stupid thing to call up about'.\" \n\"Are you sure it doesn't help?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"No. And I'd like it changed. I want these numbers >gesture< down to acceptable levels,\" the Boss says. \n\"OK, but you'll only be back in a week wanting us to make more changes.\" \n[FLASH FORWARD TO TODAY] \n\"What's wrong with the statistics?\" I ask. \n\"They're zero,\" says the Boss. \"According to the numbers you answered 100 per cent of your calls last month, so you got no one hanging up inside the 1st wait period let alone the 3rd wait period.\" \n\"You're welcome,\" I say. \n\"Yes, but I don't believe it, because I rang you and you didn't answer,\" replies the Boss. \n\"Sometimes we forward the phone to another number when we're working away from the office,\" the PFY interrupts. \n\"Oh. I must have misdialled the forwarding number,\" I mutter. \n\"Three days in row?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Possibly.\" \n\"Misdialled a 4-digit extension number with a 9 digit external number.\" \n\"Yes. I lose count sometimes,\" I sniff. \n\"So these figures are a complete sham?\" the Boss sighs. \n\"No, someone answered so technically we're covered. AND they have 24-hour service too, so it will really lift the department average!\" I say, triumphantly. \n\"It's all rubbish!\" the Boss cries. \n\"No, it's statistics with a very high margin of error - which no one cares about,\" I remind him. \n\"Well we can't keep it like this!\" \n\"Why not, who's complained?\" \n\"No one's complained, but the data isn't right. We should be reporting correct data. I WANT it fixed and I want the calls answered,\" he blasts. \nSigh. \nMeaningless bloody statistics will be the end of me. \nNot as soon as it'll be the end of the Boss, though, I think, as I watch the PFY prepare to increment the \"Projects for which the proposer had a serious workplace accident prior to implementation\" figure. ® \n"}

We ran out of paper and ribbon for the machine years ago so we just taped over the paper-out and ribbon-out micro switches and feed stuff in it to be destroyed. \" \n\"Stuff?\" \n\"Oh you know, paper, cardboard, body parts. It's a bit like a chipper, only messier. Then you just tip isopropyl in the top to clean it.\" \n\"I... I'm not sure our users really care about the resilience of 40-year-old printers...\" the Boss ventures. \n\"They should,\" I sigh as the PFY tromps off up to HR. \"The gears of new printers are made of the cheapest nylon so print registration is a crapshoot. They update the drivers a couple of times then discontinue the model for another model - exactly the same - only the inkjet cartridge is minutely different and completely incompatible with any other one.\" \n10 minutes later... \"But people need desktop printers for quick one-off jobs!\" the Boss says, still trying to win me over. \n\"Turns out he doesn't,\" the PFY says popping back into Mission Control. \n\"Really?\" the Boss asks \n\"Really. I showed him the value of new technology compared to old...\" \n\"You fed his printer into the drum printer, didn't you?\" I ask. \n\"Sure, but he saw up close how old-tech was quality gear and he was completely convinced.\" \n\"And then you fed his tie into the printer.\" \n\"Yes, but only for nine seconds\" \n\"And he decided to flag the desktop printer when you let him out?\" the Boss asks drily. \n\"Let him out?\" the PFY says. \"Yes, I should probably do that. I mean if he were to accidentally put it back online again...\" \n\"That would be pretty much problem solved...\" I say, as the Boss trundles down to the basement at top speed. ® \n"}

We have a backup backup server","Link":"\/2013\/08\/16\/bofh_2013_episode_6\/","Content":"Episode 6 \nI bloody hate SRTs (or Server Room Tourists as they're more commonly called). \n\"And... what does this one do?\" the new Boss asks, pointing at a server front panel. \n\"That would be the frontend of the company portal,\" the PFY nods knowingly. \n\"And this one?\" he asks, gesturing to the panel below. \n\"The redundant frontend for the company portal.\" \n\"And this?\" \n\"The Database frontend for the portal.\" \n\"This?\" \n\"The replicated redundant frontend for the portal.\" \nAnd so it goes. I'm generally happy with a Boss who either wants to know nothing about the hardware and is happily ignorant OR with a Boss who wants to know every little technical detail and is able to provide intelligent insight into our activities, but a Boss who wants to know everything and yet still be ignorant is pushing the envelope as far as my patience concerned. \nAnd all because he wants to actually see the kit he signed purchase orders for. \nSo the PFY's doing the server room tour... \nIf it wasn't for the difficulty of getting black market halon this probably would have been solved with a quick >ca-click< an hour and a half ago... \nI can tell that by the third rack that the new Boss's enthusiasm for seeing our operation is beginning to wane, but the PFY has obviously decided to teach him a lesson and is giving him the full unexpurgated tour. At this point the Boss is just saying \"This?\" and waiting for the PFY to stop talking and move on to the next unit. \nThe Boss is so technically punch-drunk he wouldn't care what he saw any more – he just wants it to be over. I know this because he didn't even bat an eyelid when the PFY introduced him to the master and backup processors for \"The Matrix\" . \nNow it appears the PFY's doing a Excuse-Calendar -like loose triple of: { { primary, secondary, tertiary, backup, redundant, sequentially-paired} { web, portal, financials, backup, authentication, ERP } { server, matrix, frontend, backend, core} } \n\"Hang on, didn't we already see the backup server?\" the Boss interrupts the PFY. \n\"Yes, we saw the backup server, but this is the backup backup server. We have to have a backup to the backup server because how would you recover your data if the backup server was down? You'd still want to recover your data wouldn't you?\" \n\"Uh yes, I suppose so.\" the Boss says, not wanting to appear ignorant. \nToo late. \n\"So we have a backup backup server. It's important. So important that we also have a backup backup backup server.\" \n\"Uh-huh\" the boss says, numbly. \n\"Anyway,\" the PFY says, taking the Boss around the back of a row of racks \"Let's take a look at all the backend servers...\" \nThe PFY then proceeds to introduce the Boss to the rear end of all the servers he's just shown him, pretending that they're the backend servers. \nThe Boss is so mentally taxed now that he's just nodding at NIC lights blankly. \n\"However, this is the one we're commissioning now,\" the PFY says, pointing into an empty rack. \"This baby will do 14 teragigaflops with complete write cached redundant backflow prevention with a combination 2 tetracyclene octacore CPU and quadruply redundant DDR8 RAM. Sure, it's taken a hell of lot of a time to commission, but once it's up and running we'll be able to replace that entire row of backup servers.\" \n\"Really?\" the Boss says, excited by the prospect of savings. \"Where's the machine?\" \n\"I.. In there\" the PFY says, faking confusion and pointing at some empty space. \n\"I don't see anything!\" \n\"Well you wouldn't would you - it's virtual!\" \n\"Yes, but there's still a...\" the Boss says, losing faith in his technical acumen halfway through. \n\"Oh you thought we were using old-style PHYSICAL hardware?\" the PFY says \"But surely you know that clunky old servers cost almost nothing now, whilst the state of the art stuff is all super-small and super-expensive?\" \n\"Uh... yes.\" \n\"Well this virtual server is so small it can't even be seen!\" \n\"... ... Yes, but there's still an actual MACHINE underneath it all, surely?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No. That's what virtual means! The system exists virtually. I mean we wouldn't have spent 30k on nothing! ... Would we?\" the PFY bluffs. \nAnd now the Boss is really starting to get uneasy... \n\"But there still must be some sort of machine, surely?\" he asks nervously, thinking of the audit meeting he might be attending in the near future... \n\"Only on the old models.\" \n\"OKAY,\" the Boss says, preparing to lose his rag. \"You're telling me we paid 30K for what is essentially an empty rack?\" \n\"Yes. An 'empty rack' as you call it - but with 14 teragigaflops, backflow prevention and 2 tetracylene octacore!\" \n\"You're just making that SH*T up!\" the Boss snaps. \"Now I want to see, RIGHT NOW, what the F*** we just spent 30 GRAND ON?!\" \n\"You can't though. It's virtual.\" \n\"DON'T GIVE ME THAT SH**! I WANT TO SEE A BLOODY MACHINE!\" \n\"Like I said, it's virtual.\" \n\"AND HOW THE HELL WOULD I EXPLAIN THAT TO OUR AUDITORS?! THEY WON'T TAKE THIS CRAP!\" \n\"Sure they will. You'll bring them down here, I'll take them on a tour, show them some stuff, and the problems will just go away like magic.\" \n\"SHOW THEM WHAT?\" \n\"Just some stuff.\" \n\"WELL HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW ME 'SOME STUFF'?!\" \n\"Uh, ok. I'll just step outside for a moment.\" \n>Ca-Click< \nSigh. \n"}

It burns...","Link":"\/2013\/08\/23\/bofh_2013_episode\/","Content":"Episode 7 \n\"Where's my car park gone?\" I ask Security as I wander into the building in a very irritated manner. \n\"What car park?\" Security asks \n\"My Car park. Basement level 2. Right beside the lifts. Now apparently somewhere inside a large concrete room.\" \n\"Oh, that. Well we can't really talk about that.\" \n\"How about a hint?\" \n\"I... Well.,. It's the new Secure room and Security Centre.\" \n\"Secure room?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, the Corporate panic room. Where the board members would retreat to in the event of a terrorist attack.\" \n\"Terrorists? Who the hell's going to attack this place?\" \n\"Dissidents. The disenfranchised!\" he nods. \"We're a target.\" \n\"You mean... al Qaeda?\" I ask, using the words that can add a zero to the end of a security budget with the flimsiest of supporting evidence. \n\"Yes. And others!\" \n\"Really? Remind me... why would they attack us again?\" \n\"Because they hate freedom!\" \n\"Of course. And this company represents freedom in what way?\" \n\"I... uh... well we might be a strategic target.\" \n\"We're less strategic than the public toilet down the street - but I do appreciate the cunning involved in scamming a new office by pretending that the corporate big wigs would be able to use it in the event of a terrorist attack.\" \n\"They can!\" Security assures me. \"It's state-of-the-art stuff. In the event of an emergency the lift automatically goes to level 6, does IRIS recognition of board members, then delivers them to the secure room, which then goes into 48-hour lockdown, nothing in or out.\" \n\"They'd starve!\" the PFY says, wandering into the conversation with a set of car keys and a disgruntled expression. \"Is that where my car park's gone?\" \n\"Surely you must have noticed it before now?\" Security asks. \"They've been building it for weeks.\" \nIt's a damning indictment of my attention to company detail. Not only did I miss out on Security's presentation to the board to approve who-knows-how-much for a new hidey hole, I didn't even notice a large construction taking place in my own building! I really should drive to work more often... \n\"Anyway, they wouldn't starve\" he continues. \"It's a fully functioning panic room with enough food and supplies to accommodate eight people for at least a week. A lot of companies are doing it.\" \n\"They'd never last a day. They'd get sick of each other and leave,\" the PFY opines. \n\"They can't. The first 48 hours are complete physical lockout which can't be overridden. Then they can use the external cameras and sensors to decide if they want to extend the lockout for another 48 hours, then another 48 hours, and so on. If there was only two people in their they could stay there for weeks,\" says the Security bod. \n\"They'd still have access to the internet, and phones, and stuff?\" the PFY asks, obviously contemplating – as am I – being in complete isolation from users whilst tucking into board members' food and beverages. Then there's the overtime and meal allowances that we could claim... \n\"Uh-huh,\" Security says. \"They ran a bunch of data cables from the basement a couple of days ago, which was when the cabling guy tried to lock himself in - so they've disabled that until the big demo.\" \n\"The big demo?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah, four of the board members are going to do the 48 hour lock-in as a promo for the safe room design company.\" \n\"With a pantload of food and booze, movie channel and all the comforts of home?\" \n\"Uh-huh. The design company is paying for the whole thing and all they have to produce is a video diary.\" \nPart of me is a little bit concerned I didn't exploit the \"heightened danger\" crap before this. I really have been off my game recently. The rest of me is just annoyed about missing out on that lock-in thing. \nTwo days later and the lock-in has begun. With all the hoopla that's surrounded it you'd think they were embarking on the first manned exploration of space. The board members' entrance has all the pomp and circumstance of The Right Stuff. \n\"This is not a good thing,\" the PFY says, as he rolls out the plans of the bunker once the actual lock-in has been triggered. \"It's pretty impressive. I can't see any way that we can break in - the walls are three armoured tilt-slab layers thick with an oxygen-activated polymer cement in between that fills any cut that's made between the layers. I thought we could just cut the power cables but they've got a standalone generator with enough fuel for three weeks running.\" \n\"Yes, It really would make an excellent Batcave,\" I say, thinking fondly of the chunk of building the PFY and I once kept as our own. \"If only there was a way to both prove it to be a bad idea and discourage reuse. If only...\" \n\"!\" the PFY gasps, seeing I already have an idea.. Ten minutes later in the basement level 2... \n\"Every plan has a flaw,\" I say to the PFY, \"and a quick perusal of the plans yesterday uncovered it. Why do we never put server rooms in basements?\" \n\"Flood risk,\" the PFY says. But the place is sealed! We could flood the entire two basement levels and it would be fine. Besides, they'd turn the water off before it got that bad. \n\"We could\" I say, \"but we don't need to. Behold the comms distribution board for the bunker. Behold this very large stilson wrench!\" >CRASH< >CRASH< >CRASH< >CRASH< \n\"Yeah, so?\" the PFY says, \"so they have no way of communicating with the outside world. Big deal.\" \n\"Behold my large and ugly stilson wrench,\" I say, walking over to a darkened corner of the basement. \"BEHOLD this large and ugly valve.\" >SQWARK< >SQWARK< >SQWARK< \n\"They've got enough water to last them for weeks,\" the PFY says. \n\"Oh, this valve doesn't stop water coming IN,\" I murmur to the PFY \"This valve stops waste water going OUT.\" \n\"And by waste water you mea... Oh you didn't!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Didn't what?\" I ask. \"Didn't isolate the building from the sewer so that the new lowest point for six levels of effluent is in that room? Didn't pay the cafeteria chef 100 quid to have a 'Johnny Cash 10th anniversary memorial chicken Vindaloo' as the meal of the day?\" \n\"The Ring of fire!\" the PFY gasps in hushed tones. \n\"I've not calculated the volume of the room, but I'm fairly sure it won't get higher than knee level.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Thigh if enough people go back for seconds.\" And the rest, as they say, will be history. \n"}
{"Date":1380844800000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2013\/10\/04\/","Title":"BOFH: Welcome to Helldesk, ma'am, may I take your bags?","Link":"\/2013\/10\/04\/bofh_2013_episode_8\/","Content":"Episode 8 \n\"You're looking stressed!\" the PFY says to the Boss, who's behaving more irrationally than usual. \n\"What?\" the Boss responds. \n\"Stressed,\" the PFY says. \"You. Look. Stressed.\" \n\"Oh. Yes,\" the Boss says, looking around in a semi-dazed manner. \"Have a stack of Service Desk Candidate's CVs to look through.\" \n\"What for?\" \n\"For people. For the Service Desk.\" \n\"Yes, I understand that bit, but why are you doing it?\" \n\"Oh. Uh, because in the past there's been a few... problems.\" \n\"You mean the Helldesk supervisor's unspoken belief that IT knowledge is in some way linked to cup size?\" I chip in. \n\"I... wouldn't have put it quite that way,\" the Boss sighs \n\"You mightn't, but others have,\" the PFY replies. \"And the vacancy you're looking at – did it come about as the result of some sort of 'hands-on test of IT ability'?\" \n\"We settled out of court with her and he resigned last week,\" the Boss sighs. \"Only it turns out the woman concerned was the Financial Director's daughter and he's put substantial pressure on the board about the attitudes of IT people to women. As a result we're now implementing a zero-tolerance policy to workplace harassment and now I have to find an acceptable candidate from the 100 or so respondents and be able to defend my selection against future allegations of 'old-boys' favouritism.\" \nA small part of me feels sorry for the Boss, and not just because he's been screwed over by the nastiest director in the building. There are two main ways into a Helldesk Supervisor role, the most common being the rising-through-the-ranks method, by which stage the supervisor is usually so bitter and twisted that they advocate summary execution as the preferred method of sorting out paper jams, or the \"new broom\" approach of appointing someone with no history in IT whatsoever in the hopes that they'll apply the management strengths of their former role to the task of forging a coherent team. \n\"So what made you pick someone from the auto parts industry as a Helldesk manager?\" the PFY asks. \"Surely you'd have realised that that industry was a bit of a sausage fest and the photos of half of them would probably appear in the illustrated dictionary under misogyny?\" \n\"His CV said he had a background in servicing the needs of his team!\" the Boss replies defensively. \n\"Ah. It seems patently obvious that you lack the ability to read a CV,\" I sigh. \"How about we give you a hand?\" \n... 10 minutes later, in the Boss's office, in front of a huge pile of possibilities... \n\"Okay, this is WAAAAAY too many CVs to have to wade through, so we'll apply my quick-cull technique,\" I say. \n\"Which is?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Bin anything that is printed on a different-coloured paper.\" \n\"But you do that to catch the reader's attention!\" the Boss gasps, recounting some morsel from the CV-writing course he went on the last time he was made redundant. \n\"So you're looking for an attention-seeking person?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Oh... I suppose not,\" the boss says, flipping some pink paper into the bin. \n\"Next, anyone who has a picture of themselves on their CV...\" >clunk clunk< \n\"Why?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Because the only people who need a photo of themselves on a CV are pop or porn stars,\" I say. \n\"What about supermodels?\" the Boss snaps back. \nThe PFY responds briskly: \"A. People generally already know what supermodels look like, and B. Give 'em five years and they'll usually fall into one of those two categories anyway.\" \n\"Next,\" I say. \"Anyone who uses some ludicrous font like Comic or Brush Script.\" >clunk< >clunk< \n\"?\" \n\"See, the problem with the Helldesk is it's a boring, mundane, soulless experience handling the day-to-day trivia of idiots, day after day, until you finally crack and turn up to work in your undies, carrying a power saw.\" \n\"And what's that got to do with fonts?\" says the Boss. \n\"Using different fonts or coloured paper, enclosing a multimedia presentation, etc, are all things which indicate people with hope – and if there's one thing a helpdesk person doesn't need it's hope,\" the PFY replies. \nI continue: \"Yes. You want that crushed out of them long ago so that they won't leave after three months when a better role comes along. You want someone who'll keep their sanity after the 20th phone call about a problem which was solved in item 2 of the FAQ – someone who is immune to user incompetence and laziness.\" >clunk< >clunk< >clunk< \n\"I'm still not with you.\" \n\"You want someone whose resume is just Times Roman on plain white – unwatermarked – paper. Someone low-key.\" \n\"And a woman,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"A woman? Why?\" \n\"Anything other than a woman means you're an old-school bigot – which cuts the number of potentials down to...\" the PFY says >clunk< >clunk< ... >clunk< \"...these three.\" \nOur discussion is interrupted by the arrival of the Financial Director. \n\"Just thought I'd stop by and see how things are going?\" he murmurs. \nThe Boss makes some positivish comment which seems to placate him into drifting off. \n\"If he's here,\" the PFY murmurs quietly, \"who's running the Death Star?\" \nWe leave the Boss to contemplate the hopefuls while we take our lunch. On our return, however the Boss's PA informs us that he's had to taken the rest of the day off sick. \n\"Oh, nothing trivial I hope?\" the PFY asks. \nBefore she can respond, Lord Vader glides back into the Boss's office. \n\"How's that vacancy coming along?\" \n\"He made a decision before he left,\" the PA burbles. \n\"Oh yes, and who'd he choose?\" \nBefore I can respond, the PFY has already blurted out: \"He said something about the one with the biggest tits!\" \nSo that'd be another vacancy to fill. \nSigh. \n"}

Rat-eating, coming-to-work-naked, bat-shit mad. \nIt's possible that I'd be mad enough to murder the installers that ask the user some pointless question like: \"I know there's three more hours to go in this install process and you've probably gone back to your desk now, so I'll just pause the install process until you tell me what colour font you'd like on the console session that you'll never use…\" or \"This isn't a stub install, I'm getting everything from the DVD image, but could you just tell me, half way through the process, what your network settings would be – even though you're probably installing this on a firewalled network which isn't the final network anyway. \" \nI might even get off.   And on the murder charge as well. \nAnd so, to calm the raging sea within me, gazing out windows becomes a critical work-sanity activity. \n\"The aircon bloke is here,\" I observe, seeing a downtrodden individual approaching the building who looks more than familiar with the foibles of users. \n\"How can you tell?\" the Boss asks. \"He's carrying a dog-eared service manual that looks a bit like the phone books you used to get in phone booths - only it's not got half the pages missing and doesn't smell of wee.\" \n\"PROBABLY doesn't smell of wee,\" the PFY corrects. \n\"It could be anyone,\" the Boss says, peering out the window. \n\"Nah, it's the aircon guy,\" the PFY says. \"He's got that look about him.\" \nThe Boss asks: \"What look?\" \n\"The look of having to cope with idiots on a daily basis.\" \n\"What idiots?\" \nPeople who say things like 'What idiots?' the PFY says. \n\"People who say, 'The office feels hotter than normal'  or 'Can you just change it so that it's on cold when I'm warm, and warm when I'm cold – except if I've just had a shower, and then it should be warm till I feel uncomfortable?',\" he adds. \n\"PEOPLE WHO SAY,\" I add, warming up to the topic, \"'I know that I share this airconditioning with everyone else in this office, but can you make it so that they can't change the temperature - because I'm the only person who can tell temperature properly?'\" \n\"People who ask if they can have the cool breeze but not the fan noise!\" the PFY adds. \n\"PEOPLE WHO BRING A THERMOMETER IN TO PROVE THAT THE TEMPERATURE AT THEIR DESK IS 22 DEGREES, NOT 21 LIKE IT SAYS ON THE WALL - 20 FEET AWAY!\" \n\"But still he shows up to work, day after day,\" I say. \"Until that day when he finally cracks and takes the bottle with the skull and crossbones on it up to the roof to pour into the fresh air inlet...\" \n\"I..  Do you think he might do that?\" the Boss asks nervously. \n\"I might do what now?\" I ask, returning reluctantly from my daydream. \n\"Uh nothing,\" the Boss says, not wanting to water that dream plant... \n\"Anyway, what can we help you with?\" I ask. \n\"Is the system running slow today?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Day after day...\" the PFY murmurs quietly. \n\"Hmm?\" \n\"Nothing\" I say. \"So by 'the system' you mean?\" \n\"The computer system.\" \n\"You mean the vast collection of computing and networking resource – not the least of component of which is your desktop machine?\" \n\"You know what I mean.\" \n\"I know exactly what you mean,\" I say. \"When someone says 'Hard Drive' I know they mean desktop.\" \n\"When someone says their 'Internet' when they actually mean their browser,\" the PFY says. \n\"When people say 'memory' when they mean 'disk'.\" \n\"When someone says 'My Friends' when they really mean the people they know on Facebook.\" \n\"Yes, well, is it slow?\" \n\"Let me see,\" I say. \"I'll just fire up the system monitor.\" \n>clickety!< \n>...A minute later...< \n\"Well?\" the Boss asks, \"how long does it take to load?\" \n\"It's loaded!\" I reply. \n\"That's just a picture of the Earth from space!\" \n\"Yes - it's actually a picture of 'the system' as you call it.   Now how far do you want me to zoom in?\" \n>slam< \n\"He'll be back,\" the PFY says. \"There was a bunch of them talking about how the system was slow...\" \n\"How many?\" \n\"About five.   Two of the helldesk geeks were complaining about it as well.\" \n\"So with their 'advanced knowledge'...\" \n\"You mean the LinkedIn endorsements from people they barely know?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes…   they will shortly be popping in with some suggestions about why 'the system' is slow...\" I say. \"Undoubtedly,\" he nods. \n\"Okay, pass me that cricket bat and switch the light off on your way out will you?\" \n. . . \nSometimes it feels like my life consists  mostly of waiting. \nLong, long periods of waiting. \nI don't look out the window though. \nI need my night vision glasses... ® \n"}

Occasionally.\" \n\"FROM ANYONE!\" \n\"From anyone - internal or external?\" \n\"Uuuhhhhhmmmm - I think both.\" \n\"When?\" \n\"Just now?\" the Boss says. \n\"Just now SENT or Just now they rung you about it?\" \n\"What difference does it make?\" \n\"It means the difference of how many thousands of lines of mail log I have to search through.\" \n\"Surely you'd just search for my email address?\" \n\"And then filter the thousands of messages to you to find the ones that aren't getting there?\" \n\"I don't get thousands of email messages!\" \n\"HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING THEM ALL?!\" The PFY asks. \n\"Well, I don't. But I don't expect I'd get that many.\" \n\"Fair enough. Okay, so we can check the logs.\" >clickety< >tappity< >click< >tappity< >tap< >tap< >click< . \n\"OK, so this past hour you received 17 email messages. One from your home email address with a subject line of 'Reminder', eight which have a subject line of 'Purchase orders' between you and the beancounters, six from the helpdesk - subject 'email', and two from a yahoo address with the subject line of 'Goat Worrying'.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"I mean 'Travel Information'. So easy to mix those two up. So which one didn't you get?\" \n\"The one from home and the Travel Information ones.\" \n\"Okay, it looks like they were received, so the problem is probably with your mail client. Do you have any rules configured into Outlook?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Have you checked?\" \n\"No, but I didn't put any in.\" \n\"Doesn't mean there aren't any rules. What about antivirus? Have you got something aggressive instead of the company standard?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Home machine - are you reading your email from home?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Phone - are you synchronising with that?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"OK, so we're at the point of 'Whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth'.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well the only thing that's changed is that we added 'Goat Fetish' to the client filters.\" \n\"WILL YOU STOP WITH THE GOAT FETISH CRAP!?\" \n\"No, what I'm saying is that's the ONLY thing that WE have changed with the mail system in the past month-and-a-half. So I suspect that somehow you're triggering this. \" \n\"How?\" \n\"I don't know. But I suggest a trial. How about you subscribe to the Goat Fetish mailing list...\" I start. \n\"I'M NOT...\" blusters the Boss. \n\"LET ME FINISH! Subscribe to the list, then 10 minutes later, unsubscribe - to see if it clears that from your profile.\" \n\"HOW THE BLOODY HELL WOULD IT BE ON MY PROFILE IN THE FIRST PLACE?\" \n\"Who knows, but it's worth a crack.\" \n\"I don't see how it will help!\" \n\"You won't know till you try.\" \nA quarter hour later and the Boss is attempting to explain to the Director why he signed up to the Goat Fetish mailing list (in response to an anonymous complaint) and the PFY is deleting some more of the Boss's messages with the second phone synchronised to his mailbox. \nIt passes the time between coffees... \n"}

We've tried to study him of course but he's much too geeky for our standardised aptitude tests.\" \n\"Mmm,\" I murmur non-committally, following him through pale green corridors and pausing momentarily as he swipes himself into the secure wing. \nHe rattles off the rules: \"Do not reach into his room, do not touch his door. Keep back from the window. Don't pass him anything or show him any IT equipment of any kind. Don't browse to any network addresses on your phone that he might give you, nor read any email messages you may get purporting to be from him at any time in the future - even if they state that he has come into a large fortune and needs help to get it out of the third world nation that it's stuck in.\" \nHe pauses, then adds: And again, do not show him any IT equipment, and definitely do not hand him any IT equipment - no exceptions. Do you understand? \n\"Absolutely,\" I nod. \n\"I'm going to show you why we insist on these precautions. Two days ago as a special reward for good behaviour we gave him a kebab from a local takeaway outfit. He apparently choked and his restraints were removed to permit one of the orderlies to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre. As the abdominal thrust was being delivered he must have felt the smartphone in his carer's top pocket. He did this to it...\" \nThe psychiatrist flips out a picture of a badly brutalised iPhone 5 with a cracked screen with what looks to be half a boot-print on the face. \n\"We couldn't save the iPhone but we did manage to recover our main fileshare after he used the VPN client to somehow insert a virus into our server. His pulse never got over 75, not even when he subscribed everyone on the staff contacts list to several porn and gambling mailing lists. AND he still managed to finish the kebab... \" \n\"Mmm,\" I respond. \n\"I keep him in here.\" \nThe psychiatrist gestures through an observation window in a door looking down a half-lit green corridor. \n\"We'll want to keep to the right,\" he says, leading the way \n...moments later... \n\"Stephen?\" the Psychiatrist asks quietly. \n\"Good morning,\" the pyjama-clad PFY says with uncharacteristic formality. \n\"I've brought someone to talk to you. You remember Simon, don't you? You worked for him?\" \n\"Work,\" the PFY says. \"Present tense.\" \n\"Yes, well, I don't think we need to...\" \n\"WITH, not for,\" the PFY says, gazing upwards at me and sniffing the air. \"You use generic brand contact cleaner - and sometimes acetone for the difficult jobs - but not today.\" \n\"However could he know that?\" the Psychiatrist asks. \n\"HE BLOODY WORKS WITH ME!\" I snap, before turning back to the PFY. \"Did you do all those drawings?\" I ask, pointing to the diagrams at the back of the PFY's room. \n\"Yes, we're very big on art therapy here,\" the Psychiatrist responds. \"Aren't we?\" \n\"Yes,\" the PFY responds. \"This picture is the floor plan of this building - the pastel colours denoting corridors and the foil bottle caps denoting secure doors.\" \n\"I don't think that tha...\" the shrink starts. \n\"THIS picture is a schematic of the security system, cameras in red, different coloured wool for fire, access control, cameras and alarms.\" \n\"I..\" \n\"And this picture is a fragmentation image of the good doctor's desktop machine main drive, and that inset picture is the fragmentation on the secret drive that only appears when you press the switch that you can only get to when the DVD caddy is open...\" \n\"How did you...\" \n\"A telemarketer tried to sell me a 'power conditioner' once. I looked up his home address and ate a chicken Vindaloo with extra spice and kidney beans and a fine chianti then had a dump behind his couch when he went shopping,\" says the PFY, whose eyes have taken on a fevered gleam. \n\"You probably want to ignore most of what he's saying now,\" I suggest. \n\"Where did you get this information?!\" the shrink demands, pointing to the pictures. \n\" Quid pro quo !\" the PFY says. \n\"What?\" says the doc. \n\"He wants a pound. To tell you,\" I say. \n\"No, quid pro quo literally means 'this for that',\" the Psychiatrist responds condescendingly. \n\"You know on second thoughts it was probably 50 quid,\" I reply. \"But you can probably trade knowledge for knowledge if you want.\" \n\"I'm not giving him any information on our security system!\" \n\"I'm guessing he already has that,\" I say, pointing at the pictures. \"In any case, how's his paranoia going?\" \nThe Shrink responds: \"He believes the Moon landings were faked, the CIA killed Kennedy, KFC has addictive chemicals, bottled water is a conspiracy and global warming is being deliberately covered up by large multinationals.\" \n\"Yes, but how's his paranoia coming?\" \n\"Seriously? Anyway, I really can't explain how he knows so much about our security.\" \n\"Perhaps you should ask him?\" \n\"How did you get our security information?\" he asks the PFY. \n\" Quid pro quo .\" \n\"OK\" \n\"What's your earliest memory of computing?\" asks the PFY. \n\"What?!\" \n\"Computing. Your earliest memory?\" \n\"My father had a Portable PC - a luggable they called them,\" says the Psychiatrist. \n\"Tell me about it... and don't lie - because I'll know.\" \n\"It was a work machine. One night it just... died.\" \n\"Outright?\" \n\"No, it just got noisier and noisier for days and then one night the screen just went off,\" the shrink says, sighing. \"I used to play a character-based version of Moonlander on it. And then it was gone. I was 10 years old.\" \n\"What happened next?\" \n\"I went with my father to his workplace when he returned the computer. I... ran away,\" whispers the Shrink. \n\"Why? Did someone show you a Windows Vista pamphlet?\" prompts the PFY. \n\"No, they didn't have that back then.\" \n\"Of course they didn't. Continue. You didn't just run away did you?\" \n\"No. I heard a strange noise. From the technician's room.\" \n\"What was it?\" \n\"It was a screaming. I didn't want to look, but I had to.\" \n\"What did you see?\" asks the PFY. \n\"Luggables - about 20 of them. The room was so hot. The fans - I know that now - they were running so loud.\" \n\"They were stress-testing them to destruction so that they could get them replaced by the company as faulty because they'd never approve upgrades?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And you ran away.\" \n\"Yes. But I took one with me. I got a sack barrow. It was so heavy. But I got it to the elevator. The lift lamp was out. It was so dark, so noisy. I thought if I could just save one...\" \n\"And where did you go?\" \n\"I... I pressed the button for the second floor by mistake. I thought I pressed Ground. It was dark.\" \n\"So you ended up in an office. With a computer on a sack barrow.\" \n\"Yes. They called my dad.\" \n\"And what became of your computer?\" \n\"I... They...\" \n\"Put it in the hottest part of the room and ran endless VisiCalc calculations on it till the fans screamed their last?\" \n\"... yes..\" \n\"You still wake up sometimes don't you? In the dark...\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And hear the screaming of the fans?\" \n\"... Yes.\" \n\"You probably have a mental health issues,\" the PFY says, turning to me: \"Right-o, let's go.\" \n\"You can't. You're under my care!\" \n\"Nah, he's not,\" I say. \"It was all based around a complaint which has since been shredded and all electronic information on it no longer exists... if I know the PFY.\" \n\"It has,\" the PFY says. \n\"In fact, I'd be very surprised if this door was still even locked.\" I say, pulling the door to the PFY's cell open. \"Ta-da! Actually, given that you have no reason for him being here, technically you're a kidnapper.\" \n\"I'll take that 50 quid now!\" the PFY says, seeing an opportunity. \"Actually, make it 100!\" \n\"B...but you were incarcerated for five days!\" the shrink sniffs, handing his wallet over. \n\"Yeah - the flat was getting painted,\" the PFY says. \"Needed somewhere to stay. And besides, about four weeks ago you pushed in front of us at a coffee shop, thinking we didn't notice.\" \n\"But we noticed,\" I add. \"We noticed.\" \n\"Perfect storm,\" the PFY says, extracting some cash and dropping the wallet into the Shrink's trembling hands. \n"}
{"Date":1385078400000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2013\/11\/22\/","Title":"BOFH: Resistance is futile - we're missing BEER O'CLOCK","Link":"\/2013\/11\/22\/bofh_2013_episode_12\/","Content":"Episode 12 \n\"It's quite possibly the worst sound I've ever heard!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"So you've not heard duelling banjos played on the bagpipes?\" I ask. \n\"Or... anything.. on the piano accordion?\" the PFY adds. \n\"It's unprofessional!\" he continues. \n\"No it's not, having NOTHING would be unprofessional - this just implies a lack of concern for quality!\" I counter. \nSometimes the Boss comes up with some staggeringly stupid proposal which simply must be opposed if sanity in the world is to be upheld. Other times a proposal will involve great deal of work for a paltry outcome, and still other times the proposal will involve a great amount of work for a fairly good reason, except we don't fancy the \"great deal of work\" part. \nToday's disagreement with the Boss, however, falls into category 4: Arguing passes the time. \nThe Boss has decided that our on-hold music should be of a better quality - and it's difficult not to agree with him. It really does sound like it was received on an AM radio placed at the far end of a 100 meter drain pipe, fed into a can-and-string intercom, EQ-ed to leave only the worst parts, then A-D converted to a 2 bit signal. It's truly appalling. Having never been on hold long enough, I'd not experienced the true horror of it – but that doesn't mean I'm just going to leap aboard the \"quality art-house music\" ship at the drop of a beret. \nResistance is called for – if only to test the Boss's commitment to this cause. If he folds, it wasn't worth doing anyway but if he doesn't fold... it'll give us something to do till lunchtime. \n\"We're just protecting the company,\" the PFY says, taking one of the more obscure tangents in the conversation. \n\"Protecting us? How?\" \n\"From having to pay royalties. See, any music played IN public or TO the public attracts royalties – so in effect we would owe the artist an amount of money for using their work as our on-hold music.\" \n\"What sort of money are we talking?\" asks the Boss, suspiciously. \n\"It depends on the number of calls that end up on hold, but it could be as high as 150 quid a year.\" \n\"150 quid a year - are you kidding me?! Who cares about 150 quid a year?!\" \n\"Yes\" I say, \"but think of the backlog - all those years we never paid, compound interest, penalty payments, overdue fees.. uh.. vinyl tax. We could be talking serious money. But if we do nothing then we're in the clear. The caller knows we're playing music to them but they can't discern exactly what it is we're playing because the quality is so poor...\" \n\"It's win\/win!\" the PFY blurts. \n\"It's not a win when our clients think we're using technology from the '70s!” snaps the Boss. “They'll think we're backward.\" \n\"Only if they met a board member,” I say. “Otherwise they'll just think we have an old phone system - like half the world. If you want, though, we could put some cool digital beep noises instead of the ringtone so that the caller thinks they're being routed through some sort of high-speed digital network.\" \n\"Why, what does it sound like being routed through a digital network?\" \n\"The same as being routed through an analogue network. Or hung up on. The beeps and crap are just there so that you know what stage your call is at.\" \n\"It must be sending something?\" \n\"Okay, so you ring a number and it doesn't exist. If nothing exists, what's generating the phone number-doesn't-exist beeps?\" \nThis is a \"tree falls in a forest\" situation in the making and the Boss will not like it. If he really starts to think about it, he might even get into some form of recursive loop till he takes a stack dump in his trousers. Better press the NMI now. \n\"BHAJIS!\" I shout. \n\"What?! Uh.. I... don't know.\" \n\"No one does,\" the PFY says, in hushed tones. \"We don't ask. The last person who asked was Kennedy - and you know what happened to him.\" \n\"But aren't digital networks quite a modern thing?\" the Boss asks, seeing the flaw in the PFY's ramblings. \n\"Yes, that's just what Robert said - and you know what happened to him,\" the PFY counters \nYou've got to give the PFY points for being able to think on his feet. Not think well, obviously, but think nonetheless. The Boss is confused and there's only 10 minutes till lunchtime. \n\"You know, what the hell - maybe we should change the music,\" I say, casting a knowing glance at the clock to the PFY. \n\"Actually yes!\" the PFY exclaims. \"You're right. I mean how much could it cost? I might start on that right after lunch!\" \n\"Well... excellent!\" the Boss says, surprised by such an easy victory. \"Actually I had one other suggestion...\" \n\"Yes, yes?\" I chirp, wanting to move this on as quick as possible. \n\"Our access cards - surely the budget could stretch to getting printed cards with people's pictures on them?\" \nA Category 3 request - but plenty of time to be agreeable as even the early lunch break crowd won't be clogging up the bar yet. \n\"Well yes, I suppose that's doable, so why not? We've got a couple of card printers we only use sporadically and all the photos are already captured in the system. Sure, I'll get right onto it this arvo!\" \n\"What about if we had a database that kept the cardholder information in it?\" \n\"You mean like the one already in the security system?\" \n\"Yes, but that doesn't have photos. You could sync it up or something?\" the Boss asks, hopefully. \nCategory 2, but I don't care because if we don't get out of here we'll be three people deep at the bar and won't see a cool lager until half the lunchtime has oozed away between the sweaty folds of beancounters and PR geeks who've slowly been taking over our watering hole. \n\"Premo, can do!\" I snap, grabbing my coat. \n\"Actually, perhaps we should keep the security database in the cloud?\" \nCategory 1! STUFF THE BLOODY LAGER! \n\"So you want to keep data which is local, only ever going to be local, only needed locally, never accessed remotely, not WANTED to be made available outside our building, which can only WEAKEN our security by being off site, hosted offsite.\" \n\"On the cloud. Yes.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Well, because it's the way of the future.\" \n<23 minutes later> \n\"You chaps are late,\" the Barman observes. \n\"Yes, workplace accident,\" the PFY says. \"A couple of the usual, ta.\" \n\"Really - that's the second workplace accident this week!\" \n\"Yes, dangerous business IT - lots of pitfalls.\" \n\"You mean hazards.\" the barman suggests. \n\"No, he means pitfalls,\" I reply. \"He dug the pit himself.\" \n"}

Like make-believe, only sadder.” \n“I don’t see how that’s got anything to do with the smell. If there even is a smell.” \n“Oh there’s a smell,” I say. \n“You can’t smell anything over this food!” adds the PFY\/ \n“It’s subtle, but it’s there. It’s much stronger on the upper floors though,” I say. \n“Overpowering,” the PFY nods. \n“You’re making this up!” the Boss snaps. \n“He’s not,” I say. “Years of working in IT attunes the senses to certain things. Things other people wouldn’t notice. You just know things.” \n“Things like what?” the Boss sneers. \n“I come in here and the first thing I’m doing is I’m catching the sight lines to the chicken jalfrezi.” I say \n“I saw the chicken jalfrezi, too,” the Boss says, “but it’s a bit spicy for me.” \n“I can tell you the Service Tags of all three computers behind the counter,” the PFY says, “AND that one of them has a bad cap on the power supply. C14. It’ll pop within the month.” \n“I can tell you that the guy that served us is left-handed,” I continue \n“Anyone could tell you that!” the Boss blurts. \n“But could they tell you that his thumb was infected so he was keeping it warm in the bhaji bowl?” the PFY asks as the Boss gags and tries to spit out his food. “I can tell you that the HR director weights 120kg and knows how to handle a gas barbecue. But not well.” \nI say: “I know the best place to find an unopened copy of Vista, complete with key, is in the second drawer down, at the back, underneath the Post-it notes of almost EVERY employee in this cafeteria, and on this floor I can run flat out for almost half a minute before I need a lager. And a kebab. Course my hands will be shaking if I did that, so I prefer to walk.” \n“Because he’s a professional,” the PFY adds. \n“This is rubbish!” the Boss says. “There’s no smell.” \n“There’s a smell,” The PFY and I say simultaneously. \n“Alright then, without talking to each other, on the count of three, tell me what the smell is. One… Two… THREE!” \n“Aircon coolant,” we both say. \n“R407c,” the PFY says. \n“Which means it’s a new unit,” I counter. \n“Process chiller,” the PFY nods. \n“What the hell are you talking about?” the Boss asks. \n“The coolant we can smell. It’s R407c, which means it’s one of the newer units that’s leaking.” \n“You can’t smell that!” \n“We can. It’s like a superpower,” I say. “You’ve probably got some similar skill from a lifetime of exposure to stuff you know intimately. You’d be able to detect that smell better than most.” \n“Yeah,” the PFY continues “So if someone ever steals a truckload of lard or a woman with a perm ever goes missing the tracker dogs know who to come to...” \nThe PFY can sometimes get a little cruel when he doesn’t get his bhajis… The Boss ignores him though. \n“Is it dangerous?” \n“Stalking women with '80s power rock hair? I don’t know, you tell me!” the PFY says. \n“The GAS!” \n“Only if you inhale it.” \n“But you’re inhaling it now!” \n“Yes, yes, but superpowers, years of exposure, built-up-immunity, blah, blah.” \n“So it’s on the roof, from the server room then?” the PFY asks. \n“Has to be.” \n“WHY does it have to be?” the Boss asks. \n“Because the aircon for the building is from the Ark, using R22 refrigerant, which is what the yanks use to burn holes in the ozone layer to give people skin cancer,” the PFY replies, lurching onto another one of his many conspiracy theories. \nI add: “So it’s not that. The only other refrigerant is in the server room. But because we can smell it all over the building and not just on our floor means it must be coming in the fresh air inlet, which is up on the roof, beside the only available free space within a short distance of the services riser.” \n“...Which is where the slave unit for the Server room aircon is,” the PFY finishes. “I’ll give the aircon guys a call.” \n“So they’ll be able to fix it?” asks The Boss. \n“No chance.” \n“Why not?” \n“Because it’s Friday, lunchtime. You’ll never get an aircon tech out on a Friday afternoon. They’ll be selling copper at the scrappy to buy after-work beers,” I say. \n“How can you be sure?” \n“Lifetime of IT, superpowers, professionals, etc,” I respond. \n“So what will happen?” The Boss asks. \n“The server room will slowly get hotter as the unit runs out of coolant – because the standby spare that we suggested buying years ago for when this happened – superpower, professional, lifetime of IT, etc – was turned down last year.” \n“And then what – does the server room have a temperature cut-out?” \n“Yes – but it won’t trip,” the PFY says, gazing sightlessly into the middle distance. “Because the server room has hot zones, like all server rooms, no matter how well they tell you they design them. The machines in those hot zones will shut down with overtemp conditions. The remaining two chiller units may just be able to handle the load of the remaining units…” \n“So it’ll be OK?” the Boss asks. \n“For a while, till the lights-out cards reboot the servers – other hot zones will now form. Other machines will shut down. Then restart. Then other machines.” \n“Can’t you do something?” \n“Yes. Yes we can!” \n>… 20 minutes later…< \n“Your phone’s ringing,” The barman murmurs, pointing at the PFY’s phone. \n“Yep. It’s the Boss, it’s nothing.” \n“How do you know?” \n“Because he’s a professional,” I say. “He comes in here and the first thing he’s doing is checking the sight lines to those young women there by the pool table…” \n"}

He messaged me over the break saying he wouldn’t be coming back. Something about photos in his secret Santa packet that he didn’t want to go into.” \n“So you’ve already made an appointment then?” I ask, knowing this answer as well. \n“Yes – in fact TWO appointments!” \n“Two?” \n“Yes. As you may know Roy’s P.A. didn’t return after the break either – having also received some photos...” \n“The SAME photos as it happens,” the PFY adds. \n“In any case, she hasn’t returned and we were recommended a husband-and-wife team who’d come free from a contract.” \n“Oooh, that’s never good,” The PFY says, shaking his head. \n“As a matter of fact it is! They’re a well-known couple with a proven record of problem-solving and thinking outside the box. He does the technical side and she does the program planning and organisation. They’ve helped sort out the IT in a number of companies.” \n“Trust me,” I say. “Sooner or later he’ll wake up the Crazy.” \n“What’s that supposed to mean?” the Director’s P.A. snaps from the doorway behind us. \n“It means he’ll reap the whirlwind of her Crazy,” The PFY says. \n“So all women are crazy – is that what you’re saying?!” \n“Yes,” the PFY says – skilled at defusing volatile situations, but mostly choosing not to. “But then so are all men.” \n“The Crazy lives in us all,” I say “and it’s a light sleeper. Some of us have a little bit of Crazy and some of us have a 40,000 litre drum filled to the brim of the stuff – and you don’t know how much Crazy there is until it’s awake – by which time it’s waaaay too late to try and cram it back in the box.” \n“I’m not with you,” the Director says as his P.A. stalks off – possibly with the half-awake Crazy wandering around in her mind looking for the bathroom. \n“Some things you do will disturb the Crazy,” I explain “Its eyes will open and you’ll see it and recognise it. Then it will go back to sleep and you will experience that deep sense of relief that only comes from dodging a large calibre bullet.” \n“And some things you do,” the PFY continues “will wake up the Crazy, you'll reap the whirlwind and then spend quite some time getting it back to sleep again.” \n“Other things you do,” I add, “will wake up the Crazy, give it 4 cans of Red Bull and unleash it on your world - otherwise known as opening Pandora's box.” \n“Yeah, I’m still not sure I...” \n“Okay, as a for-instance,” the PFY says, “disturbing the Crazy would be saying something offhand like ‘I like your sister’. So long as that’s all you say, you’re probably OK. Waking the Crazy would be saying something like ‘I really like your sister’ – especially if you’ve recently had the is-she-prettier- than-me conversation.” \n“Opening Pandora’s box on the other hand,” I continue, “would be saying 'I might just grab a couple of photos of her when she gets out of the pool’.” \n\"His Crazy might be prodded awake when she asks him: 'Can we really afford that?' or the old classic, 'Wow, this is the seventh time your mother has called you today'.\" \n“And the workplace is a minefield for the Crazy,” The PFY adds. “The separation of work and home provides that necessary barrier so that if hubby casually mentions that he had a working lunch with the new woman from stores about the stock retention numbers, wifey is quite likely to imagine a pasty-faced chip-batty eating bruiser who spends half her day pushing a pallet lifter around a warehouse.” \n“As opposed to an ex-model who spends half her day working wirelessly in the gym reorganising inventory levels around the country from a tablet with gentle movements of her tastefully manicured index finger,” I say. \n“And as this illusion is maintained everyone is happy. But if they work in the same place then she KNOWS exactly what every woman in the building looks like – and he’s aware of every bloke that pauses too long at her desk when her top button has come undone.” \n“Possibly on purpose,” the PFY adds, as an indication of just how lightly the Crazy can sleep. \n“If that were the case they wouldn’t have such a stellar record. These two have been working together for over 10 years and received three industry awards in the process!” \n“Uh-huh” \n“You don’t seem convinced.” \n“There are so many pitfalls,” I explain. “For instance ‘The Pause’.” \n“The Pause?” \n“The Pause between her asking ‘Does my bum look big in this?’ and you saying ‘No’ – because No is the only answer. If you respond too quickly she’ll know it’s something you’ve practised, but if you respond too slowly she’ll know that you’re thinking ‘not compared to a Routemaster’.” \n“Then there’s casualness,” The PFY says \n“Casualness?” \n“Yeah, you have to answer the question with the right amount of casualness. So if she asks you whether you think her sister is attractive, you never say ‘NO!’. That just sounds guilty.” \n“So, for that matter, does ‘WHO?’.” I add “YOU know who, and she KNOWS you know who – so all you’re really doing is stalling,” I add. \n“Which is why the best answer is ‘I suppose so’,” The PFY says. “Casual. Make it sound like you don’t think so but you’re doing her a favour because it’s her sister.” \n“And don’t ever, EVER say ‘it depends what you mean by attractive’ because that’s just stalling, and stalling…” \n“...wakes up the Crazy?” the Director asks. \n“OUT OF BED, ACCIDENTALLY BREAKING ALL YOUR OLD VINYL, CRAZY” \n“It certainly sounds challenging.” \n“You don’t know the half of it. There’s the mind games too,” The PFY says. \n“The mind games?” \n“Yeah – like ‘Which top do you think I should wear, the pink or the blue?’. Obviously you’re not stupid enough to say ‘Who cares?’ and saying ‘either’ is not showing an interest, so you say ‘blue’. \nTo which she will say ‘I think I’ll wear the pink'.” \n“The only reason we’ve come up for this behaviour is that it’s the Crazy wanting to leap bodies” I say. \n“Well I certainly...” \n“And then there’s the danger words.” \n“The... danger... words?” \n“Yes, like safe words, but very, very unsafe. If you hear them you have to fake a seizure and get the hell out of there,” I say. \n“What words?” \n“Words like ‘I just want your honest opinion’.” \n“Or ‘Don’t think of my feelings at all’,” the PFY chips in. \n“If you can’t fake a seizure then pick a finger that you don’t need and slam it in a desk drawer.” \n“Why?” \n“Because those words are actually the sound of the Tractor Beam of the Crazy engaging – to pull you into the abyss.” \n“Yes, well, I thank you for all your... help, but I think this one’s going to work out OK.” \n“Oh if only it weren’t already over,” I sigh. \n“Over?” \n“Yes, the PFY met them in the lift on the way up. Apparently there was some dispute about a webpage he’d printed of \"hottest workplaces in the UK\" with a couple of photographs circled. Fell out of his pocket, apparently – though he denied everything. Pity, I was quite looking forward to that thinking-outside-the-box business.” \n"}

An upDATE is when the system stays essentially the same but and upGRADE is when something is replaced with something perceived to be better – but which also might need updating.\" \n\"Yeah, it's the same thing. Better software,\" he snips. \n\"Think of it this way. An upDATE is when your Missus gets you to buy a new suit and and upGRADE would be when she gets Brad Pitt in whatever clothes he's wearing. She may upDATE his clothes at some stage in the future or she might just be too pleased with the upGRADE to bother.\" \n\"I still think it's the same thing.\" \n\"Yes, and I've been suggesting upGRADING the beancounters for some time now for that reason. It was my mistake trying to upDATE your perceptions. In any case, tell me more about these updates, upgrades or whatever you'd like to call them?\" \n\"These machines here\" he says, motioning to a pile of five desktops abandoned on a desk. \n\"And what update, upgrade or whatever am I applying?\" \n\"I just want them to work.\" \n\"So they're... not... working... presently.\" \n\"No, there's something wrong with them.\" \n\"So you want me to FIX them, then possibly update them, then possibly upgrade them and then possibly update the upgrade to the latest level. Or maybe you just want a partial fix?\" His face reddens: \n\"IT'S THE SAME THING!\" \n\"No, not at all. If we go back to our previous example, a partial FIX would be setting your wardrobe on fire – technically removing the bits that are broken.\" \n\"And a total fix?\" \n\"That would be making sure you were in the wardrobe at the time,\" the PFY says, appearing from the doorway behind me. \n\"What's wrong with them?\" I say, pointing at the deceased boxes. \n\"I don't know,\" the Beancounter says evasively. \n\"Hardware or Software?\" the PFY says. \n\"I guess it's software?\" he says, exceeding his runtime level of ignorance and providing evidence of untruths... \n\"So it's software,\" I say. \n\"Possibly.\" \n\"Did they all fail at the same time?\" \n\"I'm not sure. I just came into work one morning and they weren't working.\" \nIt's a lie of course – and the PFY and I both know it was a lie. If he'd come into work one morning and some machines hadn't been working I'd have had helpdesk calls and follow-up calls up the wazoo in 15 minutes. \"And the... night before they weren't working – what happened then?\" \n\"I don't know, I was at home.\" \n\"So immediately before you went home,\" the PFY says, \"were you doing something – maybe running a ghost server doing some dodgy upgrades? Maybe booted a Hiren disk and excommunicated the machines from the domain so that you could do be Master of all you surveyed? Maybe installed a bunch of software that you shouldn't have. To REALLY break the machine you must have had admin rights – right?\" \nHonestly, it's pathetic. If I had 10 quid for every halfwit who's seized administrative control of their desktop only to COMPLETELY STUFF IT UP I'd have alcohol poisoning by now. Or type 2 diabetes. Or both. The ILLUSION that somehow the access they crave will make them a code-wielding savant able to make group policy calls like a professional turns my kebab-digester. \n\"So which one was it?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I... None.\" \n\"But you stuffed these machines with administrative access, so how'd you get access?\" \n\"You gave me access!\" he shoots back. \"Two weeks ago. I'm... a domain administrator.\" \nSpace aliens, landing in my backyard and using my barbecue to rustle up some hedgehog kebabs is more believable than this. \n\"I did not!\" \n\"Not you, your Boss. He made me a Domain Administrator so that I could administer all our shares.\" \n\"He doesn't have access!\" \n\"No, but I was looking for you in your office and ran into him and he...\" \n\"He used my access to make you a domain admin?!\" I ask, scarcely believing my own voice. \n\"Apparently so,\" the PFY says, flashing his phone screen at me. \"The Boss, the Director, the bloke from H.R. who deals with all the serious-breach-of-conduct crap, and the head of security. All domain admins. And you and me of course.\" \n\"Did anyone just hear a seal being broken – maybe seven trumpets blowing?\" I ask. \n\"No, why?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I...

I'm thinking of a mix of solar and wind generation - low carbon footprint building materials, potable and non-potable water storage and filtration in the workspaces, natural and borrowed light...\" \n\"Sounds fantastic,\" the Boss burbles some more. \n\"Doesn't it?!\" the Architect gushes, stroking his beard happily. \n\"Where would we put the aircon units?\" the PFY asks. \"Only I notice that in the 'roofspace natural retreat environment' they don't seem to be pictured?\" \n\"Oh we'd never compromise the retreat environment for the sake of plant. No, the retreat environment is designed to be a wellness centre - a place of refuge and nourishment, if you will. Planter boxes with small herbs, companion planting, that sort of thing. Besides, we'll be using evaporative cooling in combination with recovered heating and cooling from passive temperature storage units.\" \n\"And the server room?\" \n\"Oh we'd do away with that. Everything's done on the Cloud these days anyway - it makes sense to do it all virtually,\" said the Architect. \n\"I suppose you're right,\" I say. \"So where will the solar panels and wind turbines be going if we're not going to compromise the retreat environment for the sake of plant?\" \n\"Well half the window elements will include solar cells, so the whole front side of the building will be generating power for part of the day.\" \n\"And the wind power?\" \n\"I've not got around to that yet but it may be raised at some height above the roof space - perhaps within an aerial hide - to keep it clear of the retreat environment.\" \n\"You mean a hide like where we could've put the aircon?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No, like I said, we'll be using evaporative cooling - it'll double as a waterfall in the greenspace in an effort to create an isolated environment of peace and tranquillity.\" \n\"You... realise we're in the city, right?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"A city with thousands of cars, noise and carbon monoxide...\" \n\"Planting a layered and tiered greenspace around the outside of the building...\" the Architect starts... \n\"...will achieve very little,\" the PFY finishes. \"Not with the noise and fume levels we get here.\" \n\"I'm sure we could enclose the space with a low-carbon polyme...\" \n\"...reducing the efficiency of the wind generation dramatically.\" \n\"I'm sure we can think of a suitab...\" \n\"And with 1\/2 the window elements being solar panels, won't we have to then put in extra lighting?\" the PFY asks. \n\"We'll be using borrowed light.\" \n\"What - like we'll borrow it from next door?\" \n\"In a manner of speaking. See, we take light which would otherwise hit a dead space on a building and channel that to an area that needs light.\" \n\"Won't that 'channelling' then start using up some of the actual office space?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Like I said, I haven't gone through everything yet but I'm sure we'll come up with a good solution,\" the Boss sniffs. \nLike most people I don't mind entertaining nutjobs on company time but sometimes they do start to get a little tiresome. The Boss has gone completely off-reservation because one of the greener Board members started talking carbon footprints and environmental responsibility. \nInstead of recognising this as the boardroom tangent that it was, the Boss has commissioned some flaky-pastry green architect whose brief seems to be designing an entire building from scratch. \n\"And this will be a printing station,\" the Architect continues. \"Instead of the traditional model of everyone having their own printers, this will centralise printing resource - with green printers using vegetable-based inks.\" \n\"...like architect blood,\" the PFY murmurs. \n\"What?\" \n\"Look,\" I say, interrupting the PFY's murderous threat. \"This company would be the greenest company in the world if - it didn't cost any money, but I suspect that you'll find that the number of board members in favour of this is inversely proportional to the order of magnitude of the cost.\" \n\"I'm not with you.\" \n\"If it cost 1 quid, all six board members would be in favour; 10 quid, 5 board members; 100 quid 4 board members, etc... until it costs a million quid and no one's interested.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yes, except that it's probably more like when it we hit 10,000 quid they'd all abandon ship.\" \n\"Well if you want to be greener perhaps we could look at carbon offsets.\" \n\"Carbon Offsets,\" I say, working up a head of steam, \"are dumb. I could word it better than that but it's so dumb that the people that support it wouldn't understand those words.\" \n\"What's wrong with carbon offsets?\" \n\"Analogy-wise, paying someone in South America to grow trees so that I can burn trees is a bit like me paying someone in Uganda 10 quid to be good to someone else so that the PFY can punch you and the Boss here in the face.\" \n\"I think that's being rather simplistic - carbon offsets will negate the harm you do in the shorter term while you look for better alternatives,\" says the Architect. \n\"Yes, but it doesn't cancel it out geographically. If that were the case I could pay someone in Africa to filter water while I pee in your bathtub!\" \n\"They could pay me to do their carbon offsets,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"You don't have sustainable forestry plantations,\" the Architect blurts. \n\"Yes I do, I have acres of them in Scotland,\" the PFY lies. \n\"Are they CDM approved?\" \n\"Of course.\" \n\"So I could actually go and see them?\" \n\"Absolutely. In fact I would insist upon it. You, me, possibly the Boss, a shovel, some lime - it would make a great day out!\" \nIt appears stupidity does know some bounds as our greenie takes on a little of the colour after doing some mental arithmetic. \n\"I think we'll just stick to the original plan.\" \n\"Well, have at it, maestro!\" I say, gesturing for the PFY that it's time to be moving on. \n\"Nutters!\" the PFY says as we exit the meeting room. \n\"No,\" the Boss says. \"It's very important to the board. They want to be carbon-neutral by 2040.\" \n\"You mean after they're all dead - with some token greenification stuff to happen in the next 20 years and all the major changes left till the last few years?\" I suggest. \"I'm surprised they even stumped up the cash for the consultation.\" \n\"Oh, they didn't,\" the Boss says. \"Our director put up 70k of our equipment budget, given that IT is one of the highest power consumers.\" \n\"70k - of OUR budget you mean.\" \n\"It's not really your money, it's the company's!\" \n. . . \nTen minutes later I'm sending 100 quid to Uganda and the PFY to the Director's office... \n"}

Some I.T. things are now just things that people can do for themselves - like printing documents or burning CDs. As that has happened, tasks requiring more technical ability - like the management of your virtual machines - have replaced them.\" \n\"Oh,\" I say, \"So what you're saying is that while the individual tasks of I.T. have changed over the years, the I.T. department itself still has a tangible place in the organisation - although calling ourselves the I.T. department is actually reflecting a much simpler role than the one we're actually performing?\" \n\"Exactly!\" \n\"So if I'm hearing you correctly...\" the PFY adds, \"there's no scones?\" \n\"NO!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"You'll have to forgive my assistant,\" I say, \"as I believe he's somewhat confused about the change you're proposing. This is not a discussion about scones...\" \n\"Not at all!\" the Boss nods. \n\"...because we'd probably call them, what - gougères? - which are essentially the same thing, but with a stuck-up new name to make it sound great.\" \nThere's a bit of a pause in the room, and then, like a reboot from flash, the conversation restarts from scratch as if nothing had been said. \n\"I quite favour Information Department,\" the Director says, obviously hoping to take over any other department that deals with \"information\" in the process. \n\"Or Division,\" Janice adds helpfully. \n\"Or... Bureau?\" the Boss asks, palming through his phone's thesaurus. \"Precinct?\" \n\"I think Department will be fine,\" the Director decides. \n\"I like the word Synergy. Like Information Synergy,\" the Boss suggests. \n\"Information Synergy,\" the Director says, rolling it round. \n\"What about Synergy of Information and Technology?\" I suggest. \n\"That could just mean Microsoft Word,\" the PFY says. \"It doesn't even mention servers!\" \n\"Synergy of Hardware and Information Technology,\" the Boss says, in breathy tones, quite pleased with himself. \n... \nIt all turned to crap just after the business cards were delivered, but still, it made sure the PFY and I weren't required at the next - emergency - renaming think-tank. \n... \nBut just when you think you're out, they pull you back in. \n... \n\"We've got a name we think you'll like,\" the Boss says. \"Janice wants to know if you'd like to come down and see it.\" \n\"Oh I'd like to go and see Janice but I can't,\" I say. \n\"Why not?\" \n\"Oh, uh, Medical reasons.\" \n\"What medical reasons?\" \n\"I have a nut allergy.\" \nEven though that one went down like the Hindenburg, I still feel a bit pleased with myself. \n\"We really do think you'll like it.\" \n... 5 minutes later ... \n\"Information & Troubleshooting?\" \n\"So I.T?\" \n\"No, not I.T - we can't use that because that would be confusing. We were thinking 'I and T'.\" \n\"Because that will never get abbreviated,\" the PFY quips. \n\"The company pays you actual MONEY to come up with stuff like this?\" I ask, suppressing the red haze. \n\"It's perfect!\" Janice says. \"It's different, but the same.

It's a safe pair of hands in troubled times.\" \n\"Sorry to cut you off mid-ramble,\" I say, \"but is there a new logo to go with this? I mean in the old days we just had an IT in block caps, but it seems like a good opportunity to shake things up a little. Maybe use a different font?\" \n\"I see what you mean, Maybe one font for the 'I' and 'T' with a different font for the 'and'?\" Janice says. \"We could use Blue for the 'I' and 'T' and maybe a Red for 'and'.\" \n\"Well it certainly sounds like you've got a lot to think about,\" I say, making for the exit. \"Keep me posted\" . \n\"So you're OK with all of this?\" the PFY asks, once we're safely back in Mission Control. \"I was sure you'd be out with the box of matches and a couple of magnesium-impregnated chairs?\" \n\"Absolutely. By the time they've finished picking fonts and colour schemes I'll be ready with foreground and background shading styles, then icon orientation and dimensions. When they've decided on that I'll start on proofing sheets for the website launch. HR will eventually run out of enthusiasm about the same time as they run out of rebranding cash. Besides, the chairs are stashed behind a lot of junk in the basement.\" \n\"Uh, I think we're paying for the rebranding,\" the PFY says. \"The Boss was talking about it at the department meeting earlier in the week.\" \n\"Ah. \" \n>BEEP< >BEEP< >BEEP< >BEEP< \n\"Hi, it's Simon in IT - or whatever we're called now.

All it has is about eight macros and a three extra tabs which are used by the macros.\" \n\"So it's probably the data then...\" \n\"But I import the same data every month.\" \n\"What data?\" \n\"Just the financials data.\" \n\"What, like monthly General Ledger summaries, etc?\" \n\"No, the transactions.\" \n\"For accounts receivable, accounts payable or something?\" \n\"For AR, AP as well as GL, Fixed Assets...\" \n\"So pretty much all transactions?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"For that month?\" \n\"No, just for the tax withholding period.\" \n\"So you're replicating the entire financials system for what, 7 YEARS?

You'd write email in excel if you could figure out how to do it in a font you like. \n\"I hardly think that's a deserved comm...\" \n\"Okay, TELL ME you don't have a spreadsheet at home with all your DVDs and CDs in it which orders them by some star rating, the price you paid for them, where you bought them, who referred you to it, what else they referred you to, a convoluted SUM function to tell you the total cost of them all and then an algorithm to tell you their current value, based upon rarity, purchase price, depreciation and movements in the US dollar.\" \n\"I need a record for insurance purposes!\" \n\"And what about the macro that tells you when you last watched\/listened to them?\" \n\"How did you know about that?\" \n\"I didn't - I just said the saddest thing I could think of. No, wait, a movie rating algorithm based on a weighted calculation of... uh.. guns, fast cars, tits... and... uuuuhm... people getting dropped into helicopter blades.\" \n\"It's a more accurate method than R ratings!!\" \n\"So's the bloke at the video shop!\" \n\"Look, this isn't getting my data imported,\" he snaps, getting back to the point. \n\"Because you can't import it,\" I say. \"You've run into one of Excel's many limitations.\" \n\"The main limitation being that it has an inbuilt stupidity limiter,\" the PFY explains. \"When the data reaches a certain point, the stupidity limiter kicks in and you have to do it a proper way.\" \n\"Like learning SQL and using that,\" I add. \"Or using the database's reporting system. Or a third-party reporting system which talks to the database.\" \n\"Perhaps you could use Access?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Access?\" he asks, no doubt in similar tones to those used to say the words \"Musket?\" and \"Shiny beads?\" in the founding years of the Empire. \n\"Yes. It's a Microsoft product. It's a database. You could import all the data into that and then talk to that with Excel.\" \n\"So I could still use my macro and make graphs?\" \n\"Sure.\" \nSometimes, just briefly, my conscience pricks me. But then I suffocate it and bury the corpse deep in my subconscious where no one goes.

I mean I could have probably recovered those Policy Document files and the Budget projection files from six weeks ago and you would never have known because they haven't changed for months...\" \n\"Yes, but we needed to see if the system works. Which it did.\" \n\"It APPEARED to work,\" I say. \"If you'd talked to us about it we could have told you about some files that would have actually PROVED that it worked. Files that had changed in the last 24 hours and that should have been recoverable.\" \n\"But we couldn't talk to you about it. If there'd been some problem with your backups then you might have realised and fixed them before the test.\" \n\"Ah, so the point of the exercise was to catch us out and not check the recoverability of files?\" \n\"Uh. No?\" \n\"But surely if you wanted to prove that files could be recovered you could have just come here and asked us to get back a file from yesterday?\" \n\"Uuuuh, no, we needed to test the system works.\" \n\"Let me make a wild guess. One of the beancounters was on some course or something in the past few weeks where they heard some horror story about a company that hadn't been taking proper backups and when something went wrong they couldn't recover ANYTHING!?\" \n\"I... don't know the specifics.\" \n\"And part of what they recommended was that you run regular backup checks to make sure that your data is safe by deleting files and seeing if your IT people could recover them?\" \n\"I guess so. But it's really important to know that these systems are working! Why else would we have them? The company RELIES on this data being recoverable. It's a huge business risk.\" \n\"Yes, I take your point,\" I say. \"It is a good thing to know and I suppose in retrospect it's good that we know that the systems we have in place are working.\" \n\"I couldn't agree more,\" nods the Boss. \n>> 10 minutes later << \n\"You went a little easy on him didn't you?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yeah well, you know they're going to delete a bunch of new files shortly just to make sure that we're not recovering stuff from 6 weeks ago...\" \n\"Ah yes, of course..\" the PFY says \n>> Two days later << \n\"I was wondering if you can recover some files for us?\" the Boss asks, entering Mission Control with the Financial Director following closely behind. \n\"Which files?\" the PFY asks. \n\"These ones,\" the Boss says, putting down a list of folders and files. \n\"Sure thing.\" \n>> 10 minutes later << \n\"Yeah, I can't recover those. Probably the nearest I can get is an archive from about six months ago.\" the PFY says. \n\"WHAT?\" \n\"Yeah, well after our chat the other day, I realised that if we have all this data from six weeks ago, there's no way to tell if the backup system is working, so I erased all the old backup data. Only problem was the erase took two days to complete and in the process the backup index files were locked so the backup system wouldn't write files.\" \n\"WHAT!?\" \n\"Well we had to be sure the system worked,\" the PFY says. \"So we started with a blank slate.\" \n\"Did you take copies before you deleted all the backups?\" \n\"Well no. I mean the indexes were locked.\" \n\"Why the hell didn't you tell anyone you were doing it - so we'd be careful?\" \n\"But how would we know if the Beancounter system of being careful about deleting files was working?\" the PFY asks. \n\"We'll talk about this some more,\" the Boss says, \"mean time we'll be recovering the data from USB drive - which I hope you'll be backing up tonight?\" \n\"By USB drive you mean the ones that were in the Financial Director's filing cabinet?\" I ask \n\"Ah... yes. Why?\" \n\"Oh, only I broke into his office last night and chucked all those usb sticks into the rubbish bin. I mean the office is alarmed so I just assumed that security would come in and discover them before the cleaner tipped them out?\" \n\"We don't set the alarm at night,\" the Financial Director blurts. \"It keeps tripping out because of the air-conditioning.\" \n\"Surely it's important to know that they alarm system is working? Why else would we have one? Surely the company RELIES on the intruder alarms? It's a huge business risk!\" \nFor a while there things are looking grim, but then a ray of hope... \n\"Actually I took a backup as well,\" the Boss says smugly, \"onto a portable hard drive.\" \n\"A portable hard drive in the top drawer of your office desk?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Ah... yes. Why?\" \n\"Only I slipped into your office this morning and replaced your top desk drawer with a metal one with a small incendiary device. It won't set the office on fire but it will burn everything in the drawer.\" \n>JANGLE!< >JANGLE!< \"WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU DO THAT!?!\" the Boss shouts. \n\"To test the fire system!\" the PFY gasps. \"Surely the company relies on the fire systems working? Surely it's a huge business risk??!\" \n\"Why the F*CK didn't you run this past someone?!\" \n\"I did. I had a chat to security about it and they thought it'd be a good test of our evacuation procedures.\" \n\"BUT THERE WAS CRUCIAL INFORMATION IN THAT DRAWER!\" \n\"Surely we've got a policy about storing crucial information in desk drawers?\" I ask. \"It could be a huge business risk...\" \n"}

They have a variable timer on them.\" \n\"Yes, but we'd like it on for exactly 12 minutes because according to our analysis people enter the building about every 11 minutes,” burbles the rep, “so if it stayed on for 12 minutes it wouldn't turn off and on unnecessarily.\" \nI lean back. \"You mean because the light would be triggered again by the person that comes in at 11 minutes?\" \n\"Yes, though we tried that...\" \n\"And it doesn't work, does it?\" the PFY says. \"Because most of those PIRs can't be retriggered while the light is on - it has to be off, and dark, for the light to be retriggered.\" \n\"Yes, I suppose that's what it is,” concedes the slightly sweaty rep. “So we were wondering if you could do something computerey to make a lighting system that would do what we'd want.\" \nComputerey. \n\"Nah,\" I say. \"It's not possible.\" \n\"Hang on a tick,\" the PFY says, not wanting to contradict me outright but doing it anyway. \"We could link up a light sensor to a Raspberry Pi, add a movement detector on another channel, and then use an output channel to trigger a contactor.\" \n\"Or you could just use a one-minute interval on the timer so that it always gets reset,\" I suggest. \n\"Yes,” says the rep, “but the light has to be on long enough to allow someone to cross the foyer in safety.\" \n\"They couldn't make it across 30 metres in a minute?\" I ask. \n\"They could be carrying something...\" \n\"You could drag a body wrapped in an awkwardly rolled carpet across the foyer inside a minute,\" I say. \"I know that for a fact!\" \n\"I... Yes. Well, they would want lights to get the lift.\" \n\"The lift buttons are always lit.\" \n\"What if the lights were out?\" \n\"They could get the stairs to the next floor – the stairways are always lit.\" \n\"What if they're disabled?\" The rep's coming to the end of his tether. \n\"So we need a system to ensure a disabled person dragging a body wrapped in carpet will be well lit the entire time they cross the foyer, and while they wait for a lift? You realise if they're dragging a body they probably actually want darkness?\" \n\"Why the hell are we talking about bodies?\" the H&S rep snaps. \n\"Well, it's a theoretical situation. Like yours.\" I'm being reasonable with him. For now. \n\"It's not theoretical. One of our accountants had a fall because the automatic lighting in the foyer turned off while he was wheeling his bike across the foyer.\" \n\"You could solve that problem with a bike free zone in the foyer,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"You could solve that problem with a roll of carpet,\" I counter. \n\"No, I think we should explore this pie system you were talking about...\" the H&S guy says. \n. . . \n\"Idiot!\" I say to the PFY once he's gone off to report to his team of freaks that they have a solution to the foyer lighting problem. \n\"Why? I think it'll be great. I've been looking for a use for that Pi.\" \n\"I have no problem with you inventing a cool solution to an interesting problem and am all for you adopting the best of British technology to the task, but I feel you have overlooked one tiny flaw in your reasoning.\" \n\"What's that?\" \n\"Every year or so when someone has a brainwave about a new way of making our passwords even more secure, what do we tell them?\" \n\"The system can't do that.\" \n\"When they want to share a particular folder with a certain number of people, securely – but not using Dropbox or any other commercial utility because the CIA might be reading it – what do we say?\" \nThe system can't do that,” nods the PFY. \n\"And can it actually do that?\" \n\"Well, yes.\" \n\"So why do we tell them it can't do that?\" \n\"Because it's a pain in the arse.\" \n\"YES! It's a PAIN IN THE ARSE! Now, when 12 minutes gets optimised to 11 minutes 45 seconds, who will they turn to?\" \n\"Me.\" \n\"Yes. And when they realise that if it's triggered three times in one minute but that shouldn't mean 24 or 36 minutes but still only 12, who will they turn to?\" \n\"Me,\" The PFY begins to slump in his seat. \n\"When they want the system to turn the lights on during a winter's day where ambient light isn't great, but they want the light to stay on until the ambient light is OK, but they don't want it turning on and off every 12, 24 or 36 minutes, who will they turn to?\" \n\"Me.\" \n\"And when they want this on EVERY FLOOR and ALL WITH DIFFERENT TIMINGS each requiring FINE TUNING, review and further fine tuning, who will they turn to?\" \n\"...me...\" sighs the PFY. \n\"And who will you turn to?\" \n\"You,\" the PFY sighs once more. \n\"And what will I turn to?\" \n\"The roll of carpet.\" \n\"Exactly.

Just found some... uh... anomalies with the asset inventory checklist,\" our friendly neighbourhood Beancounter says to the PFY. \n\"What anomalies?\" I ask. \n\"You didn't fill it out,\" the Boss says. \n\"I bloody did!\" I gasp. \n\"You wrote at the bottom 'all present and correct' and signed your name,\" the Beancounter responds. \n\"In actual fact, I think you'll find that I signed the name Sharon T Pokeworthy, but that's neither here nor there,\" I counter. \n\"Why?\" the Beancounter asks, reading the form again. \n\"I rarely use my own signature. It's a personal security thing.\" \nHonestly, I could make crap like this up for a living... \n\"People rarely check,\" I add. \n\"I... So this checklist then...\" the Beancounter says, handing over some sheets of paper, \"we really need to know what assets we have so that we can get a realistic view of the book value of our assets, the depreciation burden and maybe work out whether our depreciation schedule needs to be more or less aggressive.\" \n\"I'm sorry, you lost me at strippers.\" \n\"I never said strippers!\" \n\"Oh, that must have been the dream I was just having.\" \n\"Look, can we just find out what assets we have!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"Oh, right! Well THAT one is here >tick<, so is that >tick<... and that >tick<... and this one caught fire so we dumped it >cross<, and that one we dumped because it was crap >cross<.\" \n\"Okay, two things,\" the Beancounter says. \"One: you need to physically verify each machine is still there. Two: you need to note down the serial numbers for each thing.\" \n\"Surely you have the serial numbers already?\" the PFY asks, scanning the list. \n\"We do, but it's an anti-fraud thing the auditors want. YOU enter the serial number then WE verify it against the database for that inventory item.\" \n\"You... realise we have access to that database and could just read all the serial numbers?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Or, a far more likely scenario WRITE all the serial numbers,\" I add \"Serial numbers like '1', '2' and 'A'. But in any case there are going to be problems.\" \n\"Oh yes, and why's that?\" \n\"Well here, for instance,\" I say, pointing at a line item. \"A4 gigabyte memory module.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"Well it MAY have cost £760, as it says here – when it was bought, a million years ago – but you should have depreciated it at 75 per cent per year to get an accurate view of its current value. And secondly, it's not an asset. It's INSIDE an asset.\" \n\"Which asset?\" \n\"Who knows,\" I say, pointing at the servers in the list. \"It could be any of them.\" \n\"You'll need to find it – so we can increase the book value of whatever it's in.\" \n\"In which case I'm guessing our bin has a book value in the hundreds of thousands of pounds,\" the PFY chips in. \nSigh... \n>The next day< \n\"How could you just throw it out?!\" the Beancounter gasps. \"It's got a current book value of THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS!!!\" \n\"But a current actual value of about NEGATIVE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS,\" the PFY counters. \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"It was a piece of shit,\" The PFY says. It was a fibre attached SAN which required proprietary fibre cards in the client machines AND proprietary fibre switches to provide a redundant path to it. \n\"It used to pack a spaz every few days and flip back and forth to the redundant path - but only after it had been offline for 360 seconds. Removing the redundant path actually made it slightly more reliable, but it was STILL a white elephant because it was crammed with low capacity disks, could only do RAID 0, 1 or 5, AND required an extortionately priced licence upgrade to make any changes to it. Oh, and the management interface only ran on Windows ME.\" \n\"Tell me you at least sold it?\" the Beancounter asks, praying for the ability to write down the asset. \n\"We... ah... let it go for a song!\" \n\"Really, how much?\" \n\"No – we LET IT GO for a SONG. We told the cleaner that we'd drop it out the window onto his supervisor's car if he'd sing Judas Priest's Turbo Lover ,\" the PFY says. \n\"And it was great,\" I add. \"Some tempo problems, but he got there in the end.\" \n\"So you threw £30,000 worth of hardware out the window?\" \n\"Dropped it – yes.\" \n\"I... What about this?\" he asks, gesturing at another heavily highlighted asset with a red X next to it. \n\"Oh we still have that. It's installed on the sixth floor. But no one uses it.\" \n\"Why not? What is it? It just says survelliance system.\" \n\"Yes indeed. One of my former managers realised we had 10k left in the 'Corporate Security' budget and told us to spend it by the end of the financial year otherwise you beancounters would subtract 10k from next year's budget because we obviously weren't spending everything we asked for.\" \n\"So you just went out and bought something?\" he gasps. \n\"No, no, he was quite specific about what should be bought. In fact, I think we kept the memo in our noticeboard of shame, because sooner or later I knew we'd be having this conversation. >scrabble< >scrabble. Here we go...\" \n\"Motion sensors. You can't spend 10 grand on motion sensors!\" \n\"It depends on what motion you want to sense. And he wasn't that specific. We did it all with transducers because porcelain is an excellent conductor of sound.\" \n\"I...can't believe you'd do that!\" \n\"Ooooh no,\" the PFY says. \"No, I think you'll find that was Sharon T Pokeworthy.\" \n\"People rarely check,\" I add. \n"}

He rubs me up the wrong way - and not just because of his suggestion to move all staff to Surface hardware. \nWhere your seasoned veteran of IT will never touch version n.0 of ANYTHING, will be cautious about n.1 and will possibly dip their toe in the water at n.1.1 the Boss is a far more gung-ho adopter and believer of hype. If the advert says it's good, it must be good. If half the world is screaming out that it's bad and that wireless connection reliability has gone into the toilet after the upgrade, all it takes is a quick newsbite from the vendor saying it's perfectly OK to convince the Boss that it's green light time. \nIf we keep him on we'll end up with cupboards crammed with expensive fad-rubbish that people are too embarrassed to fess up to buying. \nLadies and Gentlemen, I give you The Newton, The Ipaq, Vista, Windows Me, Macintosh TV, The Apple III, Office Assistant, Lotus Notes, SSA Disks, dbase iV, the JAZ Drive, IBM \"deathstar\" drives, Timex Sinclair 1000, The PCjr or ANY Trackball\/ \"advanced\" mousing device. \nThe Boss, however, is unlikely to learn from these mistakes, having no grounding in the good and bad of IT. Like a simple-minded relative, he must be protected from harm and gently guided. \n\"I'll need a brick, some earmuffs and the plastic wrapping that those 2 racks came in last week,\" I say. \n\"Really?\" the PFY asks. \"Is that what you'd do to... >scrabble< 'The UK's foremost authority on deduplication strategies'?\" \n\"Say what now?\" \n\"It says so here - in the Expert Opinion column\" \nI snatch the mag off the PFY before the rays of the Boss' smugness turn gamma. Sure enough, in the \"technical\" section there's an article about backup deduplication strategies. Admittedly it's brought down to the mag-reader mentality by illustrating the basic principles using scantily clad identical triplet models... \n\"How the hell did you get to be an expert?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I am an expert. My dissertation was on backup system redundancies and deduplication strategies. What I don't know about deduplication strategies isn't worth knowing!\" \n\"No, I think you'll find what *I* don't know about deduplication strategies isn't worth knowing,\" the PFY replies... \"and I don't know ANYTHING about it.\" \n\"It's ridiculously simple!\" the Boss says. \"Did you know that deduplication can substantially reduce your backup times - especially if you do it at source?\" \n\"What about if we take VM snapshots?\" \n\"You're copying a lot of data. It takes time. It wastes time. By deduplicating your data you can save time.\" \n\"We don't need to save time. It happens overnight.\" \n\"But as data gets larger, backups get larger and take more time.\" \n\"It doesn't and they don't,\" I say. \"As time goes on, disk speeds increase – which is where we're backing up our data. And data isn't really increasing all that much anyway.\" \n\"I think you'll find it is.\" \n\"And *I* think you'll find it isn't,\" the PFY says. \n\"Of course it is; it happens everywhere!\" \n\"Everywhere without a data decreation strategy,\" I counter. \n\"What the hell's a data decreation strategy?\" \n\"It's ridiculously simple!\" I gasp. \"You encourage people not to create data – and that's really doing it at source!\" \n\"That's no strategy!\" \n\"Course it is. We turn on every possible data integrity check on the OVER-RAIDED, DUPLICATED, CONFIRM-AFTER-TOTAL-WRITE-COMPLETED disk pool which is so glacially slow and that tends to encourage people to keep their personal rubbish on USB stick. Also, we AGGRESSIVELY remove financial data greater than 10 years old, along with the data of people who have left or have been seconded to another site.\" \n\"That's no strategy!\" \n\"Yes it is! Although that's not the complete strategy. There's more. For instance: your email auto-archive - that doesn't exist,\" I say. \n\"It never has,\" the PFY adds. \"And any large file in someone's folder that they haven't touched in ages,\" the PFY continues. \"That doesn't exist either.\" \n\"You told me you used tiered hierarchical storage!\" \n\"We do. Tier one is Solid State Disk, Tier Two is normal disk, Tier Three is crap disk and Tier Four is nothing.\" \n\"That's not hierarchical! Hierarchical differentiates on data availability and access time.\" \n\"Sure it is. Access times are: super quick, pretty quick, reasonably quick and infinity.\" \n\"Surely people notice!?\" \n\"Occasionally people look, but we've found that if we link their content to some porn they've viewed on company time they just quietly delete the files, suspecting they'd accidentally overwritten it.\" \n\"And you think that's some sort of strategy?\" \n\"Indeed it is.

You want to sell us some antivirus software?","Link":"\/2014\/11\/08\/bofh_2014_episode_11\/","Content":"Episode 11 \n\"Yes, but with our antivirus software you can be guaranteed that we will track and locate 98.97 per cent of all known viruses,\" the caller says. \n\"Tell me, where did you get the 98.97 per cent from?\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well you say 98.97 per cent - not 99 and not something like 96, so you've obviously got a reason for it.\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Obviously it has two significant figures, so it's pretty accurate, but how do you know?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"I mean it's not like it's some bloody MEANINGLESS STATISTIC that you'd just roll out like some mindless telemarketer that's never actually asked the question. Is it?\" \n\"The... 98.97 per cent is our estimation of the number of virus attacks that our software would protect you from.\" \n\"So it's an ESTIMATE now?\" \n\"I beg your pardon?\" \n\"Well just a few moments ago you were guaranteeing 98.97 per cent and now you're ESTIMATING 98.97, so I'm just wondering how accurate that number is.\" \n\"It's a number based on our lab trials of the software on all the known virus vectors to date.\" \n\"So in reality you ESTIMATE that the software will pick up APPROXIMATELY 98.97 per cent of the viruses THAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT?\" \n\"Our database is updated daily to reflect each new vector!\" \n\"Each new vector you know about?\" \n\"Well of course. If we didn't know about it we'd not be able to update the signatures.\" \n\"So what you're really saying is that you ESTIMATE that you'd get approximately 98.97 per cent of the viruses you already know about. Then, when you know about a new one, there's a one-day delay while you update the signatures file, then probably a year's delay in updating because – like half the antivirus vendors in the world – your update is set to 3am in the morning of the 29th of February, IF the machine isn't being used and only if I've pressed the left shift key 17 times while clicking my mouse button to the beat of Yellow Rose of Texas ?\" \n\"Uh... do you have some problem with antivirus software?\" \n\"No and Yes.\" \n\"No and Yes?\" \n\"No, not really... and yes, absolutely.\" \n\"I don't follow.\" \n\"Well my experience with antivirus products is divided into two main categories: the Free and the Not Free.\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"In the free version you get something that is either next to useless - let's ESTIMATE that it's 43 per cent accurate or you get something that is such a resource pig that the only way a virus could POSSIBLY infect a machine is if it managed to strangle a tiny bit of CPU from the software which only appears to differ from the IDLE process in that the IDLE process serves a useful purpose, OR, something that tells you it needs 'urgent updating' every month and a half, then slaps in a bunch of crippled malware it calls 'addition security features' the moment you tell your users that it's alright to OK the update.\" \n\"Well I can see how that mi...\" \nOR, there's the stuff you pay for. The stuff that you get a choice about whether you want it to be 45 per cent effective or you want it to consume every available piece of resource. The stuff that will prompt you to renew about three months before the licence is due to expire - prompt you with a jacked up pricing because it's excruciatingly painful to install, requiring 17 clicks to complete - WITH VERIFICATION - then leaving its spoor all over your hard drive unless you EXPLICITLY tell it to remove it. \n\"AND when the renewal comes around it's also added a PANTLOAD of additional programs that you never wanted, still don't want, but can't figure out how to unbundle. I call this pensioner extortion software, because they're the sort of people you prey on!\" \n\"I think you...\" \n\"OR there's the third category, the pre-installed crap which says it's got a 12 month licence, except that the only component that is licensed for 12 months is the bloody BANNER, with every other piece of functionality crippled out after 30 days, prompting you for renewal, prompting you to add features and then spamming the living crap out of you for the rest of your life because you were stupid enough to put your email address in the registration line. Another pensioner extortion thing.\" \n\"As I was trying to say, I think you'll find that our software is an ENTERPRISE level solution...\" \n\"GOOD POINT. ENTERPRISE CLIENTS – the FOURTH category. This is where we install a distribution server that pushes out software which is harder to remove than a nun's knickers, is incompatible with half the back-rev machines on site, updates itself aggressively (and usually unsuccessfully) every 20 minutes, interrupts almost EVERY BLOODY OPERATION with a potential virus warning, and then, to top it all off gets increasingly expensive and decreasingly reliable, year after year?\" \n\"I can see you've had some issues, but I assure you...\" \n\"Please don't assure me! Don't do anything to me. Pretend that I've seen it all and that I am so bloody jaded by antivirus vendors that I would rather give money to the virus writers themselves than contribute to the economic wellbeing of a parasite!\" \n\"I... think that's a little harsh.\" \n\"Really? So if I built a house and one of the outside doors didn't work properly and you came an told me that you'd pay someone to stand in front of the door and stop burglars - INSTEAD of coming to me and telling me to do my job properly...\" \n\"I think that's a rather simplistic...\" \n\"Simplistic as in ridiculous or simplistic as 98.97 per cent?\" \n\">CLICK<\" \nWell, I call that a success. \n"}

Half the time I'm looking at some bleeding edge technology wondering what the hell it does, who would want it and whether it's worth the effort. All too often the answers are \"No idea\" , \"no one\" and \"no\" . \nStill, it grates a bit when a consultant is called in because some beancounter, board member or auditor wants to be super sure that we're making the absolute most out of our IT investment whilst also ensuring that we're keeping a weather eye out for future trends. \n\"It's no slur on you professionally,\" the Boss says as we traipse along to a meeting with our new consultant. \"It's just the company wants to be sure that we're able to meet the future needs of our clients AND that we're not spending money unnecessarily.\" \n\"Like money on expensive consultants?\" I ask. \n\"So we'll meet with him and outline what we're doing?\" the PFY asks, moving on. \n\"Meet with HER, outline where we are, where we want to be, the technologies we use, the technologies we don't and also the technologies that we aspire to use into the future.\" \n\"Here, the pub, my iPad Mini, most Android tablets and a TARDIS,\" the PFY says, \"so I can go back in time and execute Simon Cowell.\" \n\"I mean technology for improving the workplace,\" the Boss chips back. \n\"It would be an improvement!\" \n\"Uh... I think we should go in now,\" the Boss says, reaching for a door handle. \nWe dutifully enter and are met by a woman whose outfit makes our dress-code appear \"third world casual\" . \n\"Gina Barker - Lightfoot, Barker & Ellice\" she says, extending a hand. \nWe introduce ourselves and I pass the time during the initial questions about Corporate Vision, Client Base, Aspirations for the future, etc. by updating the Boss's Facebook profile which he was foolish enough to use an old password on. \nI'm just updating his relationship status to \"It's complicated by my gender reassignment surgery and my burning passion for cast iron garden furniture\" when the topic of \"IT technologies and their effect on brand recognition and the adoption of client loyalty\" comes up. \n\"I'm glad you brought that up\" I counter, buying myself a little time to think of some answer to whatever the hell it was the Gina was asking. I decide to tentatively grope at Gina's technical knowledge to see whether she's the real deal or a just a posh suit with a wardrobe full of school chum references... \n\"Ideally I feel the company's direction is shaped by the desires of our client base and yet we've really not done any in-depth work - as a discovery exercise - on what THEY will be looking for from US. Whilst we have some idea about what attracted them to the company in the first place, it's difficult to know whether the technology adoption we've currently got in play is tailored to their future needs without some form of rigorous investigative process. Otherwise, REALLY, we're leading a horse to water before we shoot it in the head.\" \nIf anyone can make anything out of that load of swill they've got my vote. \n"}

It's got the lot. Pantone Colour verification...\" \n\"Yeah we mostly do black and white,\" the PFY chips in \n\"Automatic stapling...\" \n\"One or two pages mostly...\" \n\"Wireless Printing.\" \n\"Which could actually be useful,\" the PFY says, \"we get a few laptops in occasionally...\" \n\"... over infra-red.\" \n\"Ah, so we can print from our TV remote controls?\" \n\"Automatic fax redirection.\" \n\"For the three faxes we now get a year...\" \n\"Facility for large paper bin to hold 10 reams.\" \n\"Well THAT will be useful.\" \n\"Oh, it's just a facility - you'd need to get an upgrade to get the bin installed.\" \n\"Of course we would, how silly.\" \n\"Remote Administration and Print Accounting - an upgrade from the last version.\" \n\"THANK F***!\" the PFY snaps. \"That last printer had the sh***est interface I've ever used.\" \n\"Sorry, the interface is the same, but the accounting has been upgraded - you can have up to 64 boxes now.\" \n\"We had 99 boxes before!\" \n\"Yes, but you can put names on the boxes instead of numbers.\" \n\"And doing that comes with a 35-box penalty?\" \n\"Oh, I'm not sure about the ins and outs of it.\" \n\"What about duplexing speed?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Duplexing speed is 48 pages per minute, and if you want a duplexer we can install one within 10 working days.\" \n\"What do you mean IF WE WANT ONE. WE ALREADY HAVE ONE!\" \n\"Well yes, but this is an upgrade, and not everyone wants duplexers so they were left out of the quote.\" \n\"So let me get this straight, you're giving us a printer with a bunch of features we're unlikely to use, a web interface which was probably developed as a prop for Blake's 7, which, if you go back in ANY submenu immediately logs out AND has a hierarchical menu organisation which was probably designed by a dyslexic moron with Alzheimer's, you've dumbed down the user accounting AND IT DOESN'T EVEN DO DUPLEXING!?\" \n\"Well, it was in the contract. We worked out the per page printing costs based on the contract.\" \n\"You can take it back!\" the PFY snaps. \"We don't want it!\" \n\"I can't take it back,\" he sniffs. \"It's been delivered to site. I've filled in the delivery complete form.\" \n\"Unfill it in...\" the PFY suggests \n\"I can't, I did it online.\" \n\"If that interface is as crap as the one on the printer you've probably just ordered a pizza and joined an online discussion site on yak herding! So take it back.\" \n\"Even I could, I couldn't, because your old printer will shut down soon.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Well when I send the delivery complete form in, it connects to the printer remotely and deletes all the users. So that you don't get charged when we install it in another site.\" \n\"Another site... that needs 99 users and duplexing?\" the PFY asks. \"Another site that perhaps wanted to offload their crap printers on someone?\" \n\"Uh...\" he responds, getting the guilty hunted look that you usually only see in post-sales support people. \n\"Okay, we'll deal with that later. Meantime, plug the new one in before we start getting support calls.\" \n\"Sure. Now do you have a list of all your old users and their PIN numbers and account codes?\" \n\"Don't you have that? Remotely?\" \n\"Not after I fill out the delivery complete form.\" \n\"So we'll have to make up new ones and enter them by hand - on a touchscreen with a keyboard that's half the size of the last one?\" \n\"There's a removable keyboard too.\" \n\"Oh good.\" \n\"But that's an upgrade. We can probably get one in five working days though.\" \n\"OK, get a move on, we'll do it by hand!\" \n\"I...\" \n\"I what?\" I ask. \n\"Is that a Cat-7 cable?\" \n\"Yes,\" I lie. \n\"It doesn't look like a Cat-7 cable.\" \n\"It's Cat-7 – see, it's purple.\" \n\"Well I'm just warning you, if it's not Cat-7 the automatic feed probably won't work and you'll have to feed all your pages manually.\" \n\"So that other site was having paper feed problems as well?\" the PFY asks quietly \n\"I...\" \n... \n\"And anyway, apparently he couldn't wait for the freight elevator and decided to take the new machine down the stairs to get the paper feed looked at,\" the PFY says, directing the Boss's attention to a long red smear down the wall of the stairwell... \n"}

I scratch his name off the Christmas kicking list as Gina apparently prefers to do her own work. \n\"So what are we looking for in a director?\" \n\"IT savvy,\" the PFY says, once he's tipped half a water cooler down his front, \"but not so much that they think they're smart enough to make decisions based on their 10 year old technical knowledge.\" \n\"Must be able to work as part of a team,\" the Boss babbles, jockeying for position. \n\"Should be able to sign a purchase order without unduly delaying the purchase process by reading it first,\" I add. \n\"Should be able to work well with all genders, religions and nationalities - as I myself do,\" the Boss adds. \n\"Should be able to insulate technical people from idiotic management decisions,\" the PFY snaps. \n\"Has an open door policy to staff wishing to improve the company's image,\" the Boss fires back, pointing at his door. \n\"So if I can stop you there... in basic terms you want someone with enough IT skill to get the job done, not get in the way and to smooth over any tricky issues that might arise in the interface between IT and the rest of the company?\" \n\"Exactly!\" the Boss exclaims, closing his meeting diary and gesturing us to the door. \"I think you've got a perfect handle on it. Simon tells me that you're going to Champagne this weekend, and it just so happens that my brother-in-law has an interest in a place in Troyes. Perhaps I could give you his number and he might be able to put you in touch with some people?\" \nGina, disappointingly, seems quite taken by this idea, which disturbs me somewhat. That said, I'm sure her professionalism and idiot detection will win out. \n... \nBarely a day later the PFY and I are called into a quick meeting with the head of HR. Gina and the Boss are there already, along with the overpowering smell of rodent. \n\"So we considered all the issues that you raised,\" Gina said, \"and when we went out to the market we didn't really find all the characteristics you were looking for in one candidate. However, we've had some very fruitful discussions and are now able to make an appointment of a new director.\" \nThe Boss couldn't look smugger if he'd stolen my chicken jalfrezi. \n\"Gina Barker, formerly of Lightfoot, Barker and Ellice,\" Gina says. \nI think the Boss, the PFY and I have just been put on the Christmas kicking list... \n"}

Who doesn't love Christmas?? Most of the company as it happens! \nIt's true, many of the staff here have an element of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder when it comes to Christmas - and not just because of the PFY and myself. The last day is always one full of trepidation, alcohol and a little sprinkle of emotional scarring. It's the alcohol that does it, I think. \nI really should stop putting it into the non-alcoholic punch. \nA typical last day starts slowly with staff slipping into work seemingly ready to crack on with whatever project they were doing the previous day - but this is all a subterfuge. By the time morning tea comes around, the place is a veritable cornucopia of excess fuelled by the alcohol that people have smuggled in to make the day pass quickly. \nSeasoned veterans of the last-day-carnagefest generally have two things on their person - an Oyster Card with a bunch of credit and, as a backup plan, 4 fifty-quid notes in a zip-lock bag along with a note telling the cab driver how to deliver the incomprehensible person home. Carnage. \nBy the time I've rolled into work people have usually exhausted their smuggled-in booze and have started working their way through all the gift-booze that their managers have been foolish enough to not take home the day before. \nThe worst - and I mean the worst - is the executive PA group who, year after year, get four large bottles of tequila from an anonymous supplier. \nI have asked the PFY to stop doing this several times, if only because George - our almost fossilised cleaner - is tired of the mess that it generally generates. \nStill, it's Christmas, and there's a sort of familial feel to the place as all the departments settle in for their huggy-feely moments before trolling the building in search of fun and alcohol. Or vice versa. \nThe I.T. department's secret Santa goes off like a bomb - i.e. there are hurt people everywhere. \nA couple of the presents are not tasteful at all and the \"secret\" nature of the Santa was undermined somewhat by the accidental emailling of the Santa-Recipient matchup list. Things couldn't have been worse if the PFY and I had actually waited for all the presents to be stashed in the grotto and then snuck in overnight and substituted them with other presents. \nWhich we did. \nSee, You take Geoff's present for Mary, carefully peel the tape off, remove the canvas mini-print of \"The Lady of Shalott\" and instead substitute it for something of pretty much the same dimensions - in this case a videocassette of some grainy '80s borderline legal porn. Now everyone in the office saw Geoff put that exact parcel in the grotto, so there's no point in him trying to deny it. Who knows why he did it? \nWho knows why the Boss gave his PA a framed photo of himself in only a G-String? We can only put that down to a misunderstanding. \nA misunderstanding like Perhaps the Systems guys shouldn't get an on-call allowance over the break if they're not planning on being in town. \nA misunderstanding like \"I don't need to lock my phone or keep it on me at all times\" . \nThe key to the present swap is that you only do it to a chosen few. \nOnce the Secret Santa is over and the place has calmed down a bit, the serious drinking kicks off with the arrival of the P.A.s and the compulsory Golden Slammers. \nThe PFY and I hide for this bit as the combination of Tequila and bubbly never ends well - although it often ends rather quickly. \nThe Boss sneaks into Mission Control. \n\"Okay, shut it down!\" he gasps. \n\"Shut what down - the server room?\" \n\"NO! Everything else - airconditioning, music, lifts. We need to get people out of here before there's an incident!\" \nA distant crash would tend to indicate that that particular train has sailed. \n\"WHAT WAS THAT?\" he gasps, afraid to show his face at the viewing pane in our door. \n\"Don't worry\" the PFY says calmly. \"Nothing major. I think they've knocked over the fridge. There may be someone under it - I'm not sure.\" \n\"And that's not major?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Major's when they're angry,\" the PFY says. \"Like when you turn the aircon and lifts, etc, off and it's hot and they get annoyed because they'll have to climb two flights of stairs.\" \n\"Major's when they set things on fire,\" I add. \n\"They wouldn't do that!\" The Boss says. \"Anyway, I do want you to turn everything off. It'll encourage them to leave while they're still in a good mood.\" \n\"You realise that if we turn the network off everything stops communicating?\" I ask. \"All the desktops, the phones, the printers, the fire alarms...\" \n\"What?\" the Boss says, getting that hunted look... \"Why the fire alarms?\" ® \n"}

Each department had a canvas envelope full of leave request forms, packages for external mail and, my favourite, expense claim forms with receipts stapled to them. It was the matter of a moment to rip out a receipt or two from some annoying person's claim form so that Finance would dispute the reimbursement. Or the matter of half a moment to staple an image from the PFY's Journal of Sexually Transmitted Diseases into a sick leave request form. Sometimes I'd put an expense claim in myself - once I'd found a receipt worth claiming on. Childish, yes, but it passes the time. \nIn any case someone had talked the company into getting an intranet portal - now that half the world has decided to abandon them - FOR SECURITY REASONS... and as a result we now have a white elephant on our hands through which navigation can only be described as labyrinthine. \"Which browser is that?\" asks the HellDesk geek. \n\"Which ones do you have?\" asks the H.R. minion. \n\"Explorer, Firefox, Opera and Safari.\" \n\"And none of them work?\" \n\"Explorer and Firefox don't.\" \n\"You should try Chrome.\" \n\"So it works on Chrome?\" \n\"No, I just mean you should try Chrome. It's so much better.\" \nI suppress the urge to yell into the hands-free mic \"BETTER HOW?!\" and just place my hand in a reassuring manner on the geek's shoulder. \n\"Do you have simplified form that he can fill out?\" \n\"Who's that?\" says the H.R. person. \nI identify myself and there's a little pause on the line - but not much. I can still feel the smugness oozing out of the speaker. \n\"We do have a pretty ugly one, but it's only meant for testing.\" \n\"Why don't we give that a try?\" I suggest. \n\"It's not as good.\" \n\"You mean it doesn't have downloadable fonts which flash at you until you enter a value that it thinks is OK?\" \n\"No there's no special fonts but YES, there's no value checking.\" \n\"Where's that at?\" \n\"Well you go to the main portal page.\" \n\"Uh-huh,\" the HellDesk geek murmurs. \n\"Click on Forms Button.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Then click on the Process and Proceedures Tab. Spelt with two Es - we can't seem to change that.\" \n\"OK.\" \n\"Now scroll down to the bottom of the list and click on the Forms link.\" \n\"That's different from the Forms button?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"OK, clicked on that.\" \n\"And now you should get to a new page which has some department tabs on the top.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"So click on H.R.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And then on the Forms tab.\" \n\"This is the forms tab on this page?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"OK,\" the HellDesk geek says, probably wishing he'd started leaving breadcrumbs about five links ago. \n\"And then click on the HR link.\" \n\"OK,\" the HellDesk geek says, completely lost. \n\"So now there's a list of forms that you can fill out for work. But you don't want to click on them, you want to click on the link on the bottom right-hand corner which says DEVELOPMENT.\" \n\"OK >click<\" \n\"Okay, so now you're on the development environment of the portal so you just need to go back down the same path as before Forms, Process and Proceedures - with two Es - Forms, HR department, HR and NOW you should have a list of the forms you can fill out - but this time the links are all in red because it's in the development environment. If you click on the Leave form there it will be the one without customisation.\" \n\"So this is the development environment?\" I ask. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"So won't this form register a leave request in the development environment, not the live one?\" \n\"Yes, but it's printed out so it goes to the same place anyway.\" \n\"So it's processed manually.\" \n\"Well yes,\" he blurts, as if to a fool. \n\"So the portal is really just... an electronic internal mail system - really no better than email?\" \n\"No, it's authenticated!\" \n\"Oh right,\" I say, marvelling at the technology. \n\"There's no In-Lieu option,\" the HellDesk geek says. \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"There's no In-Lieu option. I'm taking time in Lieu for overtime worked.\" \n\"Oh right, yes, of course there isn't. To take time In Lieu you need to get to the ORIGINAL leave form, take ANNUAL leave, but put it in a negative amount, then, in the Notes field put TIL. Then you can come back to THIS form and fill out a leave form for the positive amount.\" \n\"I... see,\" the HellDesk geek says, broken. \n\"And we'll process it and have it back to you in a couple of days.\" \n\"But I want to take the Time in Lieu now - well at lunchtime, when I started this process.\" \n\"Well I can't speed up the approval process. I need to get your form, print it out, send it to your manager to sign, then he'll fill out his online approval form and we'll be done. If it all checks out.\" \n\"So it's going to take days?\" \n\"Well yes. It didn't used to take this long but we let all the internal mail delivery people go.\" \nAround this time I hang up the phone and make a couple of suggestions to the young HellDesk geek in what can only be described as a paternal manner. 1.) Use the live environment to book out -40 hours overtime, 2.) Use the Live environment to book out eight hours TIL, and 3.) Use the baseball bat from the social club sports gear to ensure that the H.R. bloke only enters 1) into the database. ® \n"}

When the mail server hardware you're using is so old that all the plastic in the badges (with a vendor name no-one can remember any more) have started to discolour and peel off you know you have a potential problem. When you suggest to Senior IT Management for the third year running that if they're going to save money on some project, perhaps it should be the intranet portal, which does nothing, links to nothing and produces nothing (apart from seething anger in the users who are forced to use it to submit online holiday and sick leave requests), your problem is a little bit larger. \nInstead of raging against the machine as it were, I take the moral high ground and point out to the Boss that this problem has occurred because we were forced into taking our mail into the cloud. \nI'm not actually against cloud-based email - so long as people understand that split-second response times they envisage are potentially not going to be realised. \nIt's my own fault for not nipping this in the bud when the portal idea first raised its head. Miles after everyone else had realised that portals were last year's nightmare the company decides that we need one (thanks to a consultant who appeared out of absolute nowhere, made some outrageous recommendations and disappeared like magic before the project could be implemented. [By 'magic' I mean very much like the cement that was poured into the foundations of the building across the road around three-and-a-half years back when the project kicked off.]). \nAnd the project - unlike the consultant concerned - just would not die. You get a couple of senior managers of some departments keen on an idea with lots of flashing lights and potential glory and they'll be throwing money at it like it's a stripper with a vacuum cleaner. And the more money they tip into it, the less likely they are to axe it, so in the end it's a vast black hole of cash threatening to suck the company into the void. \nMY cash - destined for good, not for waste. \nSo when the time comes to invest in a cloud solution to email problems (because although we don't have a capital budget to buy hardware we do have an operations budget they can fillet) we choose the cheapest solution there possibly is. One with what the PFY has called the ONE NINE uptime solution. That's 9 per cent, not 19 per cent. \nSupport is non-existent, because the 24-hour support lines are run over a proprietary VoIP audio conference platform which - surprise, surprise - has performance issues at exactly the same time as the mail server has issues (i.e. work hours). \n"}

I found one in the park. It was a bugger of a thing to get into the building. Fought me the whole way!\" \n\"Why the hell did you bring a dog then?\" The Boss is getting a little heated. \n\"Well, I was thinking about getting a dog a couple of months ago, and when I saw the Bring Your Own Dog day I thought if numbers were low you probably wouldn't have one again – so I brought one in hoping you might have a Bring Your Own Dog day again.\" \n\"BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE,\" the Boss snaps again. \"DEVICE! Why the hell would we want you to bring your own dog anyway – or drink?!\" \n\"Oh, I always have a couple of cases of Newky sitting under the server room floor in front of the process chiller output,\" I say \"In case of emergencies.

WHO THE HELL WOULD HAVE A BRING YOUR OWN DRINK DAY?!\" \n\"I did think it was a little unwise – foolish even,” I say. “But then this is exactly how I felt before they got us to install Vista on people's desktops – AND Windows 8 – and we still did that.

I was just about to send the PFY into the server room to get another.\" \nHe's still frowning. \"How can you misinterpret BYOD?\" \n\"I'm not sure I follow you. Are you implying it's a 'thing'?\" \n\"Of course it's a thing! Studies have found that 95 per cent of employees bring some sort of device into the workplace and so we should be making use of it. It's what we call a socialised cost cutting measure – it'll save us a fortune in machines!\" \n\"And cost us a fortune in support,\" I add. \"But by device you mean their phone – or maybe a tablet – and not a real computer?\" \n\"They might bring a laptop in,” concedes the Boss. “They're most welcome to bring their desktop computer in if that's what they want. It's all about savings.\" \n\"But we'll have to deal with all their virus problems, their computer slowness problems. THE INCOMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS!\" \n\"Yes, but 90 per cent of the work a lot of people do is emailing documents around, so if it can do that we're saving money.\" \n\"But still losing money on support,\" I shoot back. \n\"But saving money on hardware – one of the company's largest spends,\" the Boss says. \"I'd think you two would be all for it – I'm sure your home machines are higher spec than here?\" \nThe PFY gasps. \"So you want US to bring our home machines in too?\" \n\"I'm just ... encouraging ... you to think of the company's spend,” purrs the Boss. “If we save money here we'll have it to spend in other areas.

We've had a whole advertising campaign in the cafeteria for the past week!\" \n\"Ah, well that would be your mistake,” I say. “All we saw was the diary reminder which just said BYOD by today's date. I didn't see any other advertising.\" \n\"There's posters and flyers in the Cafeteria! Every day for a week!\" \n\"Ah well, we've not been to the cafe for a couple of weeks.

Even though he knows better, he's attempted to explain something technical to management. \nI don't know why he did it – he's aware of the risks, and yet he still did. \n\"KAY-SHING – not CASHing\" he says, speaking slowly so the Boss can understand. \n\"But surely it's the same thing?\" \n\"It IS the same thing, but if we use the KAY pronunciation it'll stop anyone thinking there might be money involved.\" \n\"What money?\" the Boss asks, suppressing excitement. \nI could honestly write a flowchart of the Boss' thought processes. It wouldn't be big: \nThe PFY knows this, but still every now and then he throws a pearl into the void. \n\"What he's trying to say\" I blurt, deciding to help the PFY, \"is that sometimes it's good to keep things close to you – for efficiency.\" \n\"How do you mean?\" \n\"Well in your case you might keep a couple of stale lard sandwiches in your top drawer to save you driving home to get your wife to rustle up a culinary delight every time you get peckish.\" \n\"Oh, I just use the vending machine downstairs.\" \n\"Not the point,\" I snap. \"But to explain further: if you have something that you use often it's better to keep it close than having to do all the work of going and getting it. You know – like how your wife keeps a copy of the book 'Coping with disappointment' on her bedside table instead of in the bookshelf.\" \n\"Or how you might keep cash in your wallet, because it's quicker to pull your wallet out instead of going to the bank every time you need to pay for something \" the PFY adds, interrupting the Boss' thought processes before he gets offended. \n\"I... see.\" \n\"So in our case, while we might put all our data into the cloud somewhere what we're also doing is KAY-SHING our data locally. That way we have a local copy on the fast network as well as a backup – and remote access copy – in the cloud.\" \n\"So it would be quicker than waiting for the cloud?\" the Boss asks hesitantly. \n\"For our on-site users, yes. Off-site users would use the cloud, which would probably end up being faster for them.\" \n\"So is our copy of the data called a 'near side cache'?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No, it's just called a cache.\" \n\"But it's near us,\" he whines. \n\"It is, but most all caches are near – so the whole 'near-side' crap is what we call 'operationally redundant'. It would be like saying acne-ridden deep fryer operator , because all deep fryer operators are acne ridden. Or saying Idiot Boss because al-\" \n\"Or money-grabbing, lying, pre-sales person\" the PFY says, again interrupting. \"So in the end we have this cache and it stores all the data we use most commonly – and because it's near it means that we won't be slowed down with accessing our data from the cloud – AND if there's an internet outage we can keep on working.\" \n\"Internet outage?!\" the Boss gasps. \nThe PFY is on a roll today and I realise there was a line missing from my boss-brain-flowchart between what's-in-it-for-me and lunchtime: \n\"..I thought we had redundant internet?\" he asks \n\"We do have redundant internet,\" I say, but every now and then there's a possibility that a particular outage would be common to both of them.” \n\"Is there another internet?\" \n\"Yes,\" I say, \"but you need a bunch of Cortexiphan to make use of it.\" \n\"Cortexiphan?\" the Boss asks. \"Should we be getting hold of that? Is it a type of network cabling?\" \nAround about now I feel that I should leave the PFY to it – him being the person who opened Pandora's Box in the first place. \n\"Yes\" the PFY lies. \"And it's included in this server which I'd like you to sign off on.\" \n\"I thought you said that this was a KAYSHE thingy.\" \n\"It is a cache thingy, and if you look at the memory spec you'll see that it's been configured with DDR3 ECC – Extra Cache Cortexiphan. With this in our server it'll bypass network outages by having a backlink to online content.\" \nThe Boss is teetering on the edge of dummy-mode but he just needs someone to plant the boot of a tier-3 technical topology buzzword on his arse and give him a good push. \n\"It's tier-3 Cortexiphan we're looking at so obviously it's topology redundant with multiple backchannels and has the full dual Dunham processor architecture behind it. With a 2 Teraflop Bishop Gating protocol, obviously.\" \n***DUMMY MODE ON*** \n\"You know, I think I heard that somewhere,\" the Boss says, scratching his signature on a piece of paper. \n... \nLater, in Mission Control, I consider suggesting that the PFY might want to arrange a tragic workplace accident before the kit arrives and is deployed but then realise that everything I just thought was, as they say, operationally redundant. ® \n"}

Now we just push in the extras and then pop it into the freezer for a few hours till it's nice and hard and easy to handle. And we're done,\" the PFY says with a flourish. \nI can't believe I've just spent quarter of an hour of the company dollar watching the PFY create a fake turd out of a packet of crushed gingernuts, some coconut oil, a few chopped peanuts and three corn kernels. \nPart of me feels a little guilty – but that feeling soon passes. \nI'm not sure what the PFY has planned for this but I make a mental note to be in early tomorrow morning so as not to miss out. \n... The next day... \n>CRASH!< \n\"WHERE IS HE?!\" the Boss shouts, stampeding into Mission Control in a veritable fury. \n\"Where's who?\" \n\"WHO DO YOU THINK?\" \n\"Uh, the PFY? Why?\" \n\"WHY WHAT?\" \n\"Why do you need him,\" I stall. \n\"So he didn't tell you?\" \n\"Tell me what?\" \nThis “answering a question with a question” thing is a lot more fun if you look at it as a personal challenge and try to beat your previous high score. \n\"WHAT HE DID YESTERDAY!\" \n\"What did he do yesterday,\" I ask, writing the new high score on the whiteboard after crossing out the old one. \nThe Boss goes on to recount the PFY's latest boredom-inspired practical joke which occurred once I'd left the building yesterday. \nApparently, once the aforementioned biscuit-based sculpture was nice and firm, the PFY deposited it on the floor beside the office coffee machine. Half an hour later when it had thawed a little and a sufficiently large group of appalled onlookers had gathered he'd stepped up, dipped his finger in it, stuck his finger in his mouth and remarked about how nutty it was – causing at least one of his co-workers to upload their lunch. \nI don't mention how lucky the Boss is that the PFY couldn't find any quick-dry lacquer or they'd have needed to buy a new water chiller... \nBoredom is not a good thing at Mission Control. Although, like everyone, we hate crises, the total absence of them (due to the PFY and my forward thinking – and our policy of shielding management from making technical decisions) can make work a little bit non-challenging at times – which in itself is challenging. \n\"He said something about having to reboot the internet NTU,\" I reply. \"It has some sort of memory leak apparently. If the reboot doesn't work he'll slap in the service spare.\" \nI have just told three lies in the space of 20 seconds. He's not rebooting the NTU, it doesn't have a memory problem, and we don't have a service spare. Four lies if you count the fact we don't have an NTU. \nThat's what boredom does to you – you just make up lies for the practice. And to beat your own consecutive-lies high score. \n\"Nice tie,\" I add. That's five. \n\"So what's this NTU doing?\" \n\"It's what it's not doing,\" I reply. \"You know how each packet is supposed to have a responding acknowledge packet which is source routed back to the originating hardware address using the Bourne Protocol? Well ours has apparently been flipping between Ghost protocol and the Fourth Protocol because of a memory issue.\" Six. \n\"I see,\" the Boss says, getting in on the whole lying game. One for him. \n\"Yeah, it's one of the Cyberdyne T-800 model 101s,\" I burble. \"Good but they don't tolerate changes of pressure very well.\" \nSeven. I'm on a roll. \n\"We had planned on using a T-1000 but apparently they have problems with extremes of temperature, which only leaves the T-X and apparently they can suffer catastrophic failures when interoperating with older models. So we're sticking with the T-800 for now.\" \nI've lost count. Let's call it 10. \n\"So when will he be back?\" \n\"Well apparently he sensed a little bit of ill-will towards him this morning and thought he'd spend a bit of time out of the office. I realise now that it must have had something to do with yesterday's joke.\" 11. \n\"It's hardly a joke,\" sniffs the Boss. \n\"C'mon,\" I say, \"It's just a bit of fun. Sure, they're a bit annoyed now, but in a year or so they'll be laughing about it as hard as we did.\" 12. \n\"I thought you didn't know about this?\" \n\"I didn't!\" *HIGHSCORE* \"But it's all meant in fun.\" \n\"So you just keep this stuff on hand for your own personal fun, do you,\" the Boss snaps, dragging the PFY's drawer open to find another thawing item. \n\"And THIS – will this be nutty too?\" he asks, sticking his finger in it and shoving it in his gob. \n\"Uhhhhhhhmmmmmm, not really. What was on the lunch menu yesterday?\" \nI'll give the PFY one thing – popping it in the freezer made it a hell of a lot easier to transport... \n"}

Now take a deep breath","Link":"\/2015\/06\/05\/bofh_2015_episode_7\/","Content":"Episode 7 \"Oh this takes me back to the early days of ST225s!\" the Boss burbles. \nI am getting a personally tailored lesson in being careful what I wish for. \nOn one hand, the PFY and myself wanted a new Boss who at least knew which end of a keyboard he could shove up his arse when he asked for the ability to type Norwegian potato language into a Word document without having to stick his tongue out – but on the other hand, we didn't want some tech-savant who can't have a bowel motion without syncing it with Google Drive. \nSo we played it safe with the slave traders and checked the box on a burnt-out has-been who's less likely to cause waves than an anorexic high diver with a parachute. Someone whose career is so far behind him he needs the Hubble telescope to look back on it. The IT equivalent of an X-Factor judge, in other words. \nThe downside to our choice is that we'd forgotten how much of a pain in the arse someone who lives in the shadow of their former glories can be. If I hear one more war story about how they used to assemble bytes by hand from a box of 1s and 0s and then hammer them into a 150-baud serial cable with a mallet I'll be tempted to take the mallet to someone myself... \n\"He's so dated!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Of course he is – when he started in IT, pound notes still had a picture of Caesar on the back. In fact, when he started it was just I.\" \n\"He predates T,\" the PFY says, shaking his head. \nAnd the worst part of it all is that telling dull stories about the distant past to the uninterested is a contagious disease. Before I know it, I find myself regaling the Director's PA with the intricacies of converting dot matrix printers to scanners. But as I said, it's contagious, so while I'm banging on about how crap shuttle-mounted digitisers used to be, the PFY segues into scanning technology as a whole and how really it owes a debt of gratitude to the massive table top digitisers of yesteryear. \n\"Where'd she go?\" the PFY asks, after what seems like only moments. \n\"Home,\" I say. \"It's 10 past 5.\" \nThat's the other thing about rambly stories – once you get talking, you lose track of time. If it wasn't for the absence of bum pain you'd think you'd been abducted by aliens. \n\"Did she just leave?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I'm guessing she left sometime after you mentioned how you used to digitise pictures on an A0 digitising table from an image thrown on to it from an overhead projector.\" \n\"Did I say that?\" \n\"You did. I may have added something about digitising fonts by hand as well. It's easy to get sucked in.\" \n\"Not that easy, surely?\" the PFY asks \"I once went to fix a desktop machine for a bloke whose hobby was wall finishes. HOBBY! He rambled on about stucco for about half an hour!\" \n\"Stucco?\" \n\"I know what you're thinking – you're thinking you could learn all you ever wanted to learn about stucco inside of 15 minutes, including the time it took to stuff the body in a roll of carpet. But it was interesting. When I realised that, I knew I had the disease.\" \n\"The disease?\" \n\"Yes, the disease. The inability to realise that a topic is deathly boring.\" \n\"Boring?\" the Boss asks \n\"Yeah. Sometimes – like when people talk about data indexing – I can actually feel myself contemplating it. Data indexing! obviously not all extremely boring stuff is interesting. That stuff you were saying about your between-job holidays was golden as a control sample. No-one'd find that interesting.\" \n\"That's not a disease!\" The Boss says. \n\"Of course it is! You have it, but you just don't realise it. I think we might have a bit of it too.\" \n\"Anyway,\" The PFY says looking me in the eye. \"You've... never seen inside the Computer Room have you?\" \n\"No, as a matter of fact I haven't!\" the Boss chuckles – while the PFY waits patiently for my assent. \nI nod. \n\"Well come right in. So it's just your basic server room, you've probably seen millions of them in your time...\" \nAbout 10 minutes later the PFY returns with a sweat on. \n\"That was close!\" he gasps \"He started talking about changes in rack cooling over the years and how in his day they didn't have racks and... I don't know. I think I completely forgot to press the halon release in my rush to get out of there.\" \n\"Then it's lucky we have a remote\" I say, pushing a button latching the server room doors override into the lockout position. \n... ten minutes later... \n\"Oh\" I say to the PFY as I polish the remote discharge button with my handkerchief. \"I think there may have been a terrible accident.\" \n\"We should render assistance!\" the PFY says, as the doors click back into normal access mode. \n\"The thing about these old Halon systems is that they used to misfire all the time,\" the Boss burbles. \"And on more than one occasion I've found that the hold-off button wasn't even connected to anything – or worse, was connected to the immediate discharge trigger. Now most of these have been decommissioned, but many of those that are still in service have an isolator valve at the first entrance point to the room - like that one over there. So if you turn that anti-clockwise by a quarter turn...\" \n... \n\"Is it morning?\" the PFY asks. \nShit. \n"}

Because of the candlepower and stuff? And if the wick were made of magnesium, it would burn much brighter, but it'd all be over in a second or five.\" \n\"What's your point?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Nothing. I was just pointing out that it's a dumb saying.\" \nThere's been an accident. A terrible workplace accident. No-one could have seen it coming: not the Boss, not me, not the poor unfortunate architect who fell two floors down a debris pipe into a skip full of recently removed wall linings. \nNot even the PFY, who'd been talking to the architect about the relative merits of reducing the size of Mission Control to make the office open-plan area larger. \nA bloody tragedy is what it is. The good news is that apart from the concussion, the only injuries he has appeared to have sustained are fractures to all the fingers on his drawing hand. Which – as I pointed out to the PFY while he was wiping a small bloodstain off that large dent in the open window frame – is kind of ironic. \n\"That's not ironic,\" the PFY points out. \n\"So was that dent not made by iron?\" I ask. \n*HIGHSCORE* \n... \n\"He was such a good planner,\" the Boss says, shaking his head back in Mission Control later that morning. \"But apparently he's quit the job and none of his co-workers want to take it up. He'd really thought outside the box on this one, too. His plan to facilitate cross-organisational interactivity by removing individual offices and have a workflow-based open area space was... inspired.\" \nI can tell by the Boss' tone of voice that had the PFY not been so proactive it might have been the Boss bleaching a bloodstained hammer mark out of a window frame. And we all know why... \nNo-one likes open-plan. \nSure, the PFY and I are used to it from years of working in an open area, but your average office potato like the Boss just can't cope with the thought of one of the proles listening to him trying to placate the little woman when she's on the warpath about him not loading the dishwasher before leaving for work. And I'm assuming that this feeling is probably shared by the whole sack of potatoes from the Director to the lowest-tier consultant on our floor. \nI'm fairly sure the investigation of this particular incident will probably only involve a broom and some loose carpet. \n*HIGHSCORE* \n... \nOur plans for global domination are thwarted somewhat by the arrival of the CEO and a couple of suited gentlemen who wish to speak to the PFY and I individually about the accident. Apparently, \"cross-organisational interactivity\" is being driven by the top floor and anything challenging it is to be investigated with a view to crushing all opposition. \nThe PFY and I are separated – apparently to prevent collusion – and I'm led to the accident zone by one of the suits. In the intervening period a light rain has been falling and as a result some danger tape's been strung out around the missing full-height window. \n\"So in your own words, what happened?\" the suit asks. \n\"Well, let's see. I made myself an espresso, but unfortunately the machine had been switched off by the cleaner overnight and hadn't quite warmed up properly so I had to wait and make another.\" \n\"I mean about the accident,\" he snips. \n\"Yes, that's my knowledge of the accident,\" I respond. \"I was making a coffee at the time.\" \n\"I think you might perhaps know a little more than that,\" he counters. \"We have a witness who puts you at this window moments after the accident.\" \n\"Well as much as I like the CSI Romford approach, our office is approximately 20 metres from this window – so if I WASN'T here moments after the accident, there'd be something wrong.\" \n\"From what I understand, you've been present at quite a number of accidents in the past,\" he suggests. I start to get the impression there may be some form of legal angle to this investigation. \n\"I really don't know, I mean who counts these thi...\" I start. \n\"173 workplace accidents,\" he says, reading something from his notepad. \"And the second one from this very window. Not to mention two from the windows in your office.\" \n\"Really? 173? That does sound like a lot,\" I say, stepping over the tape and gazing out of the hole at the bin. \"But if you work in IT for long enough, I guess you get to see so many things.\" \n\"What things?\" he asks, a little too quickly for my liking. In fact, a little too much like an ex-policeman for my tastes. \n\"Things like a builder not replacing a window. Things like that!\" I say pointing at the window. \n\"What?\" he asks, stepping over the tape and looking where I'm pointing. \nIt's the matter of a moment to notice his hand is on the only recently cleaned piece of the window frame. \n\"Things you people wouldn't believe,\" I say. \n\"Really?\" he responds, stepping forward into the rain, which starts slowly soaking us as well as the notepad in his hand. \"Things like what?\" \n\"Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion...\" \n\"Ay?\" \n\"... I watched C-beams... glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate,\" I continue. \n\"What beams?\" \n\"All those moments will be lost in time. Like... tears. In rain...\" \n\"What?\" \n... \n\"And then he just hit himself on the hand and jumped out of the window!\" I say to the Boss, 10 minutes later. \n\"That's UNCANNY!\" the Boss says as the CEO looks on angrily. \"Your assistant just had the exact same thing happen on the other side of the building. He raved about some movie and was gone! There must be something going around.\" \n\"I know. I think it's just fortunate they both survived,\" I respond, looking to the CEO. \"I mean, imagine if they'd jumped from the 6th floor...\" \n\"Yes,\" the Boss says, following my gaze. \"Imagine.\" \n"}

Aaaaaaaaaaaand... wait for it...\" I say, after a slight flicker; \"... on the generator, too.\" \n\"Why is your room on the UPS and generator?\" \n\"So that we can shut systems down and bring them up in an orderly manner,\" the PFY says. \nWhich is a lie. \n\"We need to ensure that the server room is able to be recovered in the most optimal manner when the power comes back on,\" he adds. \nAnother lie. \n\"And of course sometimes we're here overnight till the power is restored.\" \nAbsolute crap. The only time either of us would be here overnight is if we'd spent our cab fare on booze after the tubes had stopped running. \nIn actual fact, we long ago realised that any power outage lasting longer than 5 minutes may as well be a half-day outage, because everyone decamps to the pub across the road and is reluctant to return. As a result, a few changes had been made in the last couple of months to \"optimise the use of our resources\" . All access switches are now on mains power and go out at the same time as the users' desktops – along with the phones, wireless access points and any other PoE devices. \nThe server room UPS and generator now only supply crucial services – Mission Control, the core router and firewall, the webserver (so staff smart enough to check our website with their cellphones think we're still 20\/20), our ET Legacy server, Mission Control air conditioning and – in winter – the PFY's 3-bar heater, which has an efficiency in the low teens. \nThe server room isn't completely unprotected though – we slapped in a small mains-fed UPS with a battery life that relies heavily on our 1-minute outage autoshutdown scripts kicking in. \n\"Why's it so quiet?\" the Boss asks, gesturing at the wall between us and the server room. \n\"We've shut down most of the servers to protect them from any stray capacitance or line spikes from the power outage,\" the PFY says. \nHonestly, if he could fabricate any better he'd be a 3D printer. Although the media would vary in consistency and would need to be baked afterwards, obviously. In ACTUAL fact, the auto-shutdown scripts I mentioned earlier probably need tweaking based on the age of the dodgily sourced East European batteries – calculated in lost capacity per month. \n\"Then why do we bother even HAVING a UPS and generator, if it can't keep us up and running?\" the Boss asks. \n"}

The more astute professionals often have to build feedback mechanisms into their solutions to determine their effectiveness in an out-of-band manner. \nLike earlier this morning for instance, where we could hear the muffled shouts of “fuck!” from behind the Boss' closed door, shortly followed by a much louder \"FUCK!\" . \nThen several more, increasingly louder \"FUCK\" s, followed by a series of bashing noises. Leading us towards the here and now.

A new Boss who wants to make a name for himself – like they ALL do – by lowering costs. Instead of the most effective solution – jumping off the balcony – he looks for the largest capital cost to reduce... like they ALL do. \nAt this time of the financial year desktop machines APPEAR to be costing us money because everyone waits till the end of the year to see how much dosh is left in their budget before stampeding to Mission Control to OK new desktops. \nSeeing this, the new Boss made the executive decision to reject our suggestion of name-brand PCs (which, while overpriced, are easy to order and track, relatively bulletproof, have a three year on-site warranty AND come with a licence sticker that wasn't printed on an inkjet printer in a garage in Croydon) with cut-price tin that's sourced in an ad-hoc manner from a vendor on eBay with a shorter operating life than the machines he's selling. \nAround the two week mark, these machines start failing – as predicted. The helldesk is INUNDATED with calls from people reporting their licence key is invalid, the trial period has expired or their machine has stopped working.

Or having one fired at you by the ether-fuelled cannon that the PFY built into the second from top drawer of his massive filing cabinet. That's ether the highly flammable substance – not ether as in net. \nThough an SNMP trigger does sound like a useful addition... I drop the PFY a quick email while I think of it... \nThe one good thing that the Health and Safety bloke has achieved – with a bit of manipulation – is to get soundproofing for the main office, so that the rest of the IT department isn't affected by the high noise levels from our office when we test dot-matrix printers, or while we're cleaning our 8 floppy drives while wearing our asbestos flares. \nSo Mission Control has effectively grown by about 2 metres of hallway, with the addition of some heavy soundproofed doors and what's now effectively an air-lock. The beauty of all this is that while the new soundproofing doors are access controlled, the doorbell button for our office is still just outside the original Mission Control doors. Now not even Smiley Lewis could hear him knocking. \nIn the end, of course, we're going to have to let him in, as he has one thing on his side that we cannot match – the infinite patience of the mentally deficient. \nI cut to the chase and \"notice\" him, then press the door-release button twice to let him through the two sets of doors. \n\"Well that's a hazard!\" he says, noting something down on his clipboard before gesturing back at the doors. \nThere is something about a person who wears a fluorescent vest in an office workplace that makes me want to reach for a hammer, some bleach and a large roll of plastic. \n\"What is?\" the PFY asks, encouraging him. \n\"That. There's no emergency break-glass between the two sets of doors to force them open in the event of a fire.\" \n\"That's because in the event of a fire, all the doors in the building open automatically,\" I lie – because I know for a fact that 2 sets of doors don't. \n\"But what if the fire system doesn't work?\" \n\"Then you won't know there's a fire and will die of smoke inhalation before you get to the doors,\" the PFY says. \n\"But what if the alarms work, but the automatic door-opening doesn't?\" \n\"Then you press the door-release button, which will open the door.\" \n\"But what if the fire has burnt the cabling, so that the door-release won't work?\" \n\"Then it's probably burnt the power cable energising the mag clamp – so the door will open.\" \n"}

It operates in the Middle East and North Africa region, targeting mainly Egypt, the UAE, and Yemen. \nThe hackers' main stock-in-trade involves sending malware-laced files to IT and IR staff (i.e. spear-phishing). IT personnel are targeted because they work with elevated permissions inside organisations necessary to manage and operate IT infrastructures. \nHijacking accounts run by admins therefore makes it easier for spies and criminal hackers to gain access to sensitive systems. \nIndividuals working within incident response are prime targets as they also have access to a wealth of sensitive data relating to ongoing cyber investigations within their organisations, as well as special access and permissions enabling them to hunt for malicious or suspicious activities, Kaspersky Lab adds. \nDespite the fact they are targeting high-level entities such as governments, the Gaza team uses well-known remote administration tools (RATs) – XtremeRAT and PoisonIvy – distributed through targeted and maliciously laced emails, so fairly basic hacking tactics really. \nWhat the group lacks in coding sophistication they make up for with well crafted social engineering tricks, using special file names, content and domain names (e.g. gov.uae.k*m) that help the group in their hunt for targets. \nKaspersky Lab cites examples of file names that have delivered malware to a victim’s machine, which include: \n“According to the list of targets, which includes government entities in the Middle East and North Africa region, we’re witnessing politically motivated cyber-attacks,” Mohammad Amin Hasbini, senior security researcher, global research & analysis team, Kaspersky Lab, explained. \n“By gaining control of computers with greater access to the system, the cyber-criminals increase their chances of stealing valuable information and are much more likely to cause significant damage,” he added. \nKaspersky Lab is reluctant to get into speculation about who might be behind the attack. “As attribution is the most complicated – often impossible – task when analysing a malicious cyber-campaign, we don’t as yet know who is behind it,” Amin Hasbini added. \nMore details on the Gaza cyber-gang and its ongoing campaign can be found in a post on Kaspersky Lab’s Securelist.com blog here . ® \n"}

He's back moments later with the Director. \n\"Is this true?\" the Director asks. \n\"About using advanced technology in the workspace to enhance the workplace environment?\" I ask. \"You bet!\" \n\"It would be great!\" the PFY gasps, oozing enthusiasm. \nOne thing about reading your workplace managers' emails is that you get a two-day window of opportunity before an idea is sufficiently gelatinous for them to present to us, by which stage you've had an opportunity to work out a back story. \n\"That's not what he said!\" the Boss simpers. \n\"Oh you mean the thing about autonomous company cars?\" the PFY says, recounting one of the bullet-pointed items emailed between the Boss and Director a few days back. \"I just said that the last time we tried it they got tired of the exercise and mothballed the whole thing.\" \n\"We have an autonomous company car?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"HAD,\" I say. \"As my assistant said, it was mothballed. Mind you, it was a bit of a money soak. I mean, who in their right mind would spend the money converting a British Racing Green Lotus to autonomous?\" \n\"WE HAVE AN AUTONOMOUS LOTUS?\" the Director gasps. \n\"Yes, yes, but it's mothballed,\" I counter. \n\"Where is it?\" \n\"Uhmm, probably under a tarp in the sub-basement somewhere,\" the PFY says. \"I think one of the security guards starts it up every month or so to keep the engine lubricated ... but like we say, it's mothballed.\" \n\"How mothballed?\" the Director asks, with the Boss looking on eagerly. \n\"Well it's just decommissioned. No one uses it.\" \n\"We should at least give it a test to see if it's worth restarting the exercise!\" the Director says, almost visibly salivating at the thought of taking a company Lotus for a blat. \n\"Well I ..,\" the PFY says, feigning indecision. \n\"Security will never give you the key to a mothballed project.\" \n\"Surely they would – for a, erm ... feasibility study? After all, it IS our project,\" the Boss bullshits. \n\"Not a chance – it's a company-wide project.\" \n\"I think we'll look at it anyway,\" the Director decides. \"Where is the key?\" \n\"It's at security – they won't let you have it,\" the PFY repeats. \n\"Yes, some sort of diversion is in order,\" the Director mumbles thoughtfully. \"Perhaps a small fire?\" \nThis situation seems to be escalating far better than I'd expected! \n\"That'll only get one of them out of their office – EVENTUALLY,\" the PFY says. \n\"What do you suggest?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I normally call down and tell them that I've found an unaccompanied meat lover's pizza that's still warm. They'll be here in no time!\" \n\"Perhaps you could just ask to meet them all in reception to introduce yourself?\" the Director says to the Boss. \"Now, how does the vehicle work?\" \n\"Uhh, you have to drive it manually out of the basement and onto the street as there's no GPS signal, then you just tell it where you want to go. It's limited to 25 miles per hour though.\" \nIn no time the plan is in action. The Boss has diverted security, the Director has snaffled the key and they've both headed down to the basement. \nI give security a ring. \n\"Uh, not sure if you guys have noticed yet,\" I burble, \"but it looks like someone's tampering with the CEO's sports car.\" \n\"Hell!\" one of the droids shouts. \"He loves that thing more than life itself!\" \n\"Actually, I think it would be more accurate to say he loves it more than YOUR life itself.\" \n\"We'll be RIGHT there.\" \n\"Excellent!\" I snap. \"And when you're done there, apparently someone's abandoned a meat lover's pizza on the sixth floor.\" \nSo there's no chance that security is going to make it to the basement before the Boss and Director have made their getaway. \nTwenty minutes later a couple of disappointed-looking security guards turn up at Mission Control, wanting me to fire up the locater beacon and grill cam of the CEO's pride and joy. \n\"Here we go,\" I say. \"Looks like they're on the M1, south of Luton. I'll just turn on the grill cam; lucky we thought to install that.\" \n\"What the hell are they doing?\" one of the guards asks, gazing at the screen. \n\"Who knows,\" I say, watching the car change lanes at breakneck speed, weaving amongst the traffic. \"They must have cracked under the pressure and are living out some sort of Ferris Bueller fantasy at the CEO's expense!\" \n\"Well they're certainly ... oh! Watch out, no...\" \nThe last moments on the screen prior to the Signal Lost banner was the rapidly approaching rear end of a Volvo V70 (if I'm not mistaken) in full Road Policing Unit livery. \nIt's unlikely in those last few moments of terror that the Boss and Director heard remote control hardware disconnecting and ejecting itself across the hard shoulder, as the PFY closed his driving simulator connection – and it's even less likely that the law officer they rear-ended will believe they weren't in control of the vehicle at the time – especially when the theft of the key is discovered and the camera footage of them driving the vehicle out of the building is seen. \n\"Bloody criminals,\" the PFY says, reappearing after his recent real-life-motorway-rally in the comms room. \nSome people will do anything to avoid getting a foosball table in the office! \n"}

Alcohol please","Link":"\/2016\/01\/22\/bofh_2016_episode_1\/","Content":"Episode 1 \"Why does it always have to be so difficult with you guys?\" the new Boss asks. \n\"What do you mean?\" the PFY says. \n\"Difficult. Why is it that whenever we have some suggestion and take it to you, you spend all your time thinking of reasons why you can't do it – or why we shouldn't do it – or something like that. Why can't you JUST ONCE say 'sure' and do what we bloody ask?\" \n\"I have to say that it's easier to say 'yes' to a project when we know exactly what it is – as opposed to some vague idea with no actual meat on it,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Meaning what?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Meaning someone will rock in here and say something like they want us to 'make the website better',\" said the PFY. \n\"Or the internet,\" I say. \"They want us to make the internet better.\" \n\"IS THAT SO BLOODY HARD?!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"I got this,\" I say to the PFY, having noted that the linoleum knife that was on the PFY's desk moments earlier is now no longer there. \nAnd the PFY has one of his hands hidden behind his back. \n\"What does 'better' mean?\" I ask kindly. \n\"I don't know – FASTER!\" \n\"But faster costs money. We tell you we can make it faster but it will cost money – then you ask us why we we're not using 'technology' instead.\" \n\"Or you suggest that maybe we should be using 'the cloud' for this – because the cloud IS the internet, and maybe if we thought outside the box, like you do, the solution would be staring us in the face,\" the PFY adds. \n\"We might ask you how 'the cloud' and 'technology' would make this happen, at which point you'd remind us that you don't want to be 'burdened down with the nuts and bolts of the solution' – and how you're a 'big picture' person.\" \n\"Then you'll mention something off-topic, like how we need to get this sorted before 'the internet of things' really kicks off, we'll ask you what the hell you're slavering on about, and you'll stalk off to the see the director, HR or both, claiming that we don't treat you with the respect you deserve.\" \nThe Boss stalks off and the world turns. \n\"Snap!\" the PFY says, as the Boss, the Director and some slimy toe rag from HR (who's no doubt taken a break from making some single-income people redundant) enter Mission Control. \n\"Look, I think things may have got a little confused here,\" the Director starts. \"I'm sure it's a misunderstanding and REALLY, all we want to do is get to the bottom of this because we're all on the same side here.\" \n\"I couldn't agree more – although there is a division between us and you in that whilst you might be technology suggesters, we're ultimately going to end up being technology implementers.\" \n\"Yes, well I suppose it could be said that you play for another team, but...\" \n\"How dare you!\" the PFY says. \n\"I don't think name calling and innuendo is constructive,\" I say, oozing helpfulness. \n\"Wa?\" \nBut really, REALLY, I can't be bothered creating some non-existent offence out of this situation so that the PFY and I can stomp off to \"consult our independent employment advisors\" as is permitted in the terms of our contract in response to a situation where the employer has \"created a toxic workplace environment.\" \nReally, I just want a Friday pint. \nI want a Friday, 11am pint. \nThen I want a Friday 11:15am pint, a Friday 11:33am pint, a midday pint, a 12:45pm pint, a 2pm pint, a second wind 2:30pm pint, a 3:30 pint, a pre-flattened 6pm pint which was poured for me at 5pm (before I wandered off after paying but forgetting to take the pint with me), a 7pm pint, a curry (with a kingfisher on the side), a one-for-the-road pint, a tube ride to eight stops past my station, a tube ride seven stops in the other direction past my station, another tube ride (this time only one stop past my station), ANOTHER tube ride (this one taking me all the way back to central London because I was getting overconfident about cracking that staying-awake thing), then a cab ride home. \nI want to wake up on a Saturday morning with NO memory of this pointless bloody Friday morning \"technical\" conversation – WHICH, IF I DON'T END IT SOON will extend into a Friday afternoon \"technical\" conversation – with NO chance of EVER being relevant ... and then inevitably a ritual killing. \nIf I can just make it the seven minutes until our local opens. \nJust seven minutes. \n\"It's 10:53,\" I say to the PFY. \nHe nods, and I can see a tiny bit of tension leave him. \n\"How is that relevant?\" the HR person asks. \n\"We've got an appointment in five minutes,\" I say, factoring in the three-minute mosey down the fire stairs to the pub. It's only a two-minute walk but I could fill in one minute by setting my desk on fire. Only that would mean the pub would be packed, which would mean an 11:27am pint, a 12:15, a 1:07pm pint, and lots of queuing. \nAnd nobody wants that, least of all a HR person with linoleum knife injuries. \nThe pint maths alone have burned a minute so there's only six minutes to go. I realise that the HR person said something like \"What meeting?\" a minute ago but words like that don't even have an interrupt level when it comes to pint maths, so he's just been staring at me for a minute wondering if I've had a stroke. \n\"Oh, it's 'technical shit',\" I say, \"about 'the cloud' and 'the internet of things'. You wouldn't understand.\" \n\"We're going to make the internet better,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Faster,\" I add. \n\"Stronger,\" the PFY murmurs, looking off into the distance in an unfocussed manner. \nThen I remember the fugue state episode from Breaking Bad that the PFY was talking about this morning and wander blankly behind the PFY to the door, ignoring the HR guy with a tiny slash in the pant leg of his expensive shiny suit. \n"}

An event company which knows very little about IT (and cares even less) is hosting a five-day \"Service Delivery for Technical Professionals\" course in a month or so. \nOrdinarily a course like this is about as appealing as the shower scene in a Turkish prison during stabbing season, however the company concerned DOES distinguish itself by awarding fancy looking achievement certificates at the end of the course which look impressive on the office wall. \n(Again) Ordinarily I usually ask the certificate printers to just ensure that the output of the printer is as adjacent to the input of the shredder as possible, however in this particular case the certificates are like gold - partly because they have gold lettering (told you they were fancy) but also because they act as a form of proof of attendance. \nLet me explain. \nThe event company is about as interested in IT as I am in the finer points of regulation international lawn bowls' grass height, however they do put a lot of effort into their social events - which often start around the time you check in and finish about the time you check out - either from the event or life itself. They like to think of themselves as innovators. So obviously you're in need of some proof that the course was robust and worthwhile... \nThe Junket Watch priority signal is because the Service Delivery for IT Professionals gig has an overview of \"Investigating case studies of Service Delivery methods in local industry\" - the finer print noting that the local industry they're talking about is whisky distilleries in Islay. And it's basically a five-day coach tour... \nGiven the company's policy of not permitting all members of a support team to be absent at the same time, the PFY and I are now engaged in an unspoken competition to be the person that the Director sends. In the words of the Highlander, there can be only one... \nThe PFY lurches into play almost immediately, laughing at the Director's rubbish jokes and promising to upgrade the RAM on his top-of-the-line Ultrabook. He choked on his words a little when he found out that the stuff was soldered into the motherboard, but then a promise is a promise. \nSo here we are: the PFY with his static protected needle-tip solder reworking station, the Director's laptop on the actively static-protected workdesk (which, to my knowledge has never been used since it was installed at great cost) – and me, with my paper bag to collect all the bits left over... which always happens when you take a priceless piece of kit to bits. \nIn a rare show of sportsmanship I did point out to the PFY the wisdom of backing up the machine prior to starting work, however he just saw this as me trying to make the job take longer than he'd promised - so his hybrid solution is to plug the drive into a duplication cradle while he does the hot work. Sneaky. \n\"Now are you sure you've got the A and B drives in the right order?\" I ask. \"Wouldn't want to duplicate the formatted drive over the top of the original.\" \n\"I HAVE the right drive,\" he nods. Original in slot A, copy in slot B. Pressing the 'Copy A to B' button >press<. \n\"Now, the memory - a relatively simple desoldering job. Starting with some desoldering braid to remove the majority of the surface solder >ssssizzle<, more flux >squish< to aid the second pass of the desoldering braid, and now the tricky part - applying a bit of heat while just prying up on the corner of the DIMM - not too much pressure because we don't want to tear the tracks off the...\" \n>POP!< \n\"I think you may have torn some of the tracks off the motherboard there,\" I say, leaning in and tapping on a suspiciously barren chunk of circuit board where some pads used to be whilst dropping the remains of the paper bag in the bin. After the PFY has scraped himself off the ceiling, that is. \n\"You bastard!\" \n\"No, but I help out when they're shorthanded,\" I say \n\"It doesn't matter: I can fix it,\" he responds \n\"What, with fuse wire - on high spec RAM - I doubt it.\" \n\"No - I have some ultrafine self-adhesive gold repair tape which should do the trick nicely,\" he counters. \n\"But seriously - what a beginner's mistake!\" I say. \nAnd it's true. There are only two legitimate uses for a brown paper bag in the workplace: hiding your single-malt breakfast headache medicine or scaring the crap out of a workmate. I expected more from the PFY... \n\"Whatever,\" the PFY responds dismissively. \n\"In fact, I think there's only one thing worse that falling for the old paper bag trick?\" \n\"What's that then?\" he asks. \n\"Not noticing me pressing the 'Cancel' button then holding down the Secure Erase and Confirm buttons.\" \nCHECKMATE! \n\"You've erased the A drive!?!\" he gasps. \n\"And B drive too, I think you'll find.\" \n\"Imagine,\" he says thoughtfully. \n\"Imagine what?\" \n\"Imagine what would have happened if I'd not decided to practise on your Ultrabook before starting on the Director's?\" \n\"You bastard!\" \n\"Yes I am, aren't I?\" \nStill, I don't feel so bad about stealing the PFY's keys and backing his car into the Director's earlier this morning - so it's not all bad. \nGAME STILL IN PLAY! \n"}

And it's pub o'clock soon","Link":"\/2016\/02\/26\/bofh_2016_episode_3\/","Content":"Episode 3 \nYou know what it's like. The Boss asks you some technical question, you give him a non-technical answer and he suddenly thinks you're lying to him – or worse – that you don't know what you're talking about. \nHe needs it explained to him in a manner that sounds technical, but isn't too technical for him to stack overflow. ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON. \nToday it's our website. \n\"So how secure is it?\" he asks pointedly \n\"A WordPress site?\" I ask \"Configured with every plugin under the sun? Loosely 'administered' by the PR team? Hosted on a cloud server in who-knows-where, chosen with the same care and attention you'd use in picking a toilet to use after seven pints and a bad curry and a half hour tube ride which only gets you half-way home.\" \n\"So it's not secure?\" \n\"Never updated, never vetted, protected by what's probably a one-bit self signed SSL key?\" \n\"So it IS secure?\" he asks \n\"With content that was just sucked out of our old web server and sports massaged into the new server by someone who left their A-Z of IT night course just before C, when Butchery came up?\" \n\"So it's not secure?\" \n\"Nah, it's safe as houses,\" I say. \nThe Boss has his sarcasm-proof hearing aids in so I'll have to spell it out plainly. \n\"It's insecure,\" I say. \n\"How insecure are we talking?\" \n\"It is so insecure that the hosting company remirrors it every hour.\" \n\"So... it takes an hour to be compromised?\" he asks, using a word he must have recently heard at an IT Manager's round table somewhere. \n\"No, it takes about 30 seconds to compromise, but on average it takes about an hour for the robots to find it.\" I reply. \n\"Well what are the vulnerabilities?\" he asks – again with the technical words. (It's possible he's had a stack upgrade somewhere along the line) \n\"I could tell you – but the quantum rule of insecurity applies.\" \n\"The what?\" \n\"The quantum rule of insecurity – which states that the act of observing how vulnerable a host or service is changes the insecurity level of the service. Have you not heard of Schrödinger's Laptop?\" \n\"Schrödinger's Laptop?\" \nThere's a laptop, in a box, with a bomb. The bomb is actually timed to explode at some unknown time in the future – BUT if you lift the lid there's a switch connected to the lid which will make the bomb go off immediately. So the question is, is the laptop working or not? \n\"Is it powered on? Is it open?\" the Boss asks, like a helpdesk savant. \nYou're missing the point – the point is that you might not KNOW if the laptop was working or not, but as soon as you open the lid it will DEFINITELY not be working. \n\"So... you're saying that... the laptop might have... different... states... than just working or not working.\" \n\"Who cares, it's not my laptop,\" I reply. \"And it's not my webserver either. We told them to get a reputable hosting company if they put it on the cloud and they just clicked on the first thing that came up in their Google search.\" \n\"I see. So back to this laptop –\" the Boss says, breaking out a small sweat as the CPU cranks up \"– are you saying that it could be considered to be alive, dead, neither … or both?\" \n\"Oh it's dead.\" I say. \"It's got Windows 8 on it.\" \n\"But you don't KNOW it's dead. And anyway, my home laptop has Windows 8 on it – nothing wrong with it!\" \n\"Knowing isn't the point – But we all know 8's a machine killer. \" \n\"But the only way you could be 100 per cent sure is by opening the lid!\" he says \n\"IT'S RUNNING WINDOWS 8!\" I say \"Of course it's dead. Anyway, I wouldn't open the box, I'd just tell security that someone left them a vintage slab of Tennents Extra for helping them to push start their car.\" \n\"But what if they haven't help push start a car?\" \n\"Trust me, the only thing OUR security would push start is the ciggy lighter in their car or the call button at a drive-thru deep fry house. And besides, the words 'Tennents Extra' ring in their ears so loudly the tinnitus will block the rest of the sentence out.\" \n\"So you'd maim a security guard just to prove a point?\" \n\"It's one of OUR security guards! They gain a stone a year, have a three figure BMI and an average life expectancy of 27! I'd be doing them a favour!\" \n\"So how do we make our website secure – as it sounds like we don't host it?\" \n\"You're right we don't. But there are some simple steps we generally take to secure a rogue service hosted in the cloud.\" \n\"Yes?\"  \"Well first we find the ACTUAL cloud site that is hosting the service – in this case a web site.\" \n\"...and get a consultant in to patch it and run penetration testing?\" the Boss says, with more technical words than he knows what to do with. \n\"No. Generally we get a work van, a brick, and three or four large drums of petrol with the filler caps removed...\" \n... \nThe Boss finally realises the futility of trying to engage me in technical conversation in pub-countdown time and wanders off to his office. \nThe PFY is just about to say something to me when there's a medium >crump< sound from outside the office. \n\"Schrödinger's Laptop?\" he asks. \n\"It's an ex Laptop.\" \n\"It has ceased to be,\" the PFY nods. \n"}

It should be slightly bluer. Maybe a little more yellow as well.\" \n\"So you mean greener?\"  \"No, blue and yellow.\" \n\"Yes, green.\" \n\"No, I need Blue in one area and more Yellow in another.\" \n\"Have you tried increasing the saturation of the image?\" I suggest. \n\"No, the printer should print it the way it's supposed to be printed. I don't want to go and change the original!\" \n\"You could make a copy?\" \n\"That's ridiculous!\" \n\"Have you tried using the office production colour printer?\" I say, knowing full well that the simplest solution is often the most unappealing... \n\"It's on the other side of the office and I can't keep on traipsing back and forth to the printer every time I need a true colour copy.\" \n\"Oh, so you've got a problem with several images?\" \n\"That's not the point! The printer should print the right colours.\" \nYears ago I ceased being surprised at how much effort people will put into being lazy – or to be more precise – how much effort people will put into avoiding doing something themselves. \n\"Oh, gotcha! So you just want an accurate representation of the colours on the original image out of that old, cheap and unsupported USB inkjet?\" \n\"YES!\" \n\"Sure, I think we can help you. First we'll need you to power-cycle the printer so that it does the selftest, clears the jets and runs through it's positional calibration system.\" \n\"Ok. So I'll turn it off >click< and then I'll turn it back on again >clack<\" \n\"Uh no, you need to switch it off, wait five minutes, THEN switch it back on. You do that now, and then call me back when you're done..\" \n..two minutes later.. \n\"Okay, so the printer's done its reset.\" \n\"It can't have. It's not been off for five minutes!\" \n\"There's hardly a difference between two and five minutes!\" \n\"Of course there is!\" I blurt. \"Inkjet printers use atomised particles of ink sprayed at a point in the page. If you don't wait five minutes then all the particles of ink are still granulised in the reservoir - so it doesn't print colour correctly. You need to let all the particles return to the correct fluid suspension so that the additive combinatory matrix is correct.\" \n***DUMMY MODE ON*** \n\"The what now?\" \n\"The additive combinatory matrix - the way colours mix together to get the colour you want.\" \n\"Oh.\" \n***DUMMY MODE OFF*** \n\"So you just switch her off, wait five minutes, then switch her back on, then let me know if it's sorted.\" \n\"OK.\" \nObviously it's not going to be sorted as it's a crappy four-cartridge inkjet which has problems even printing black correctly. The only reason we're having this conversation is because he's trying to force me to say the printer is knackered. If I do he'll tell his boss he needs to replace the inkjet with a four-colour production quality unit directly attached to his desktop so that no one will ever (again) see the second half of the LOVINGMOUTHFULLXXX series of JPEGs come spewing out of the printer on Monday morning when someone refills the A3 glossy paper tray... \n>Ring< \n\"Okay, it's back on but the problem's still there.\" \n\"It's not been five minutes!\" I say \n\"YES IT HAS!\"  \"Yes, it's been five minutes since you called, but not five minutes since you switched it off!\" \n\"It has!\" \n\"No, I'm looking at the USB monitor on your machine. It showed a USB disconnect and then a USB reconnect three minutes, 38 seconds later.\" \n\"It must be wrong,\" he lies. \n\"Well how about you try it for seven minutes and that way if your USB monitor has some clock issue at least we know it was five. Call me when it's done.\" \nThere is no USB monitor and there never was - I just know he wouldn't do five minutes unless he was forced to. That, and I need to keep him testing things for another 35 minutes before I can slip out to the pub. \n>Ring< \n\"Still the wrong colour,\" he says. \n\"Okay, so that's the atomisation issue checked off. In that case it's might be the heat from the stepper motor. Switch it off for 10 minutes - no less - and then switch it back on.\" \n\"How can it be heat?!\" \n\"Different colours respond to different heat profiles. So exposing an ink to 40 degrees Celsius for two minutes isn't the same as exposing it to 80 degrees Celsius for 1 minute. What we're trying to do is see if the heat from the stepper motor in the printer is causing a colour change.\" \n\"But wouldn't I just change cartridges and do a print as soon as possible before the new ones warmed up?\" \n\"That would only work if it were a permanent colour change and not a transient one from the jet stream coming into contact with a heat point source. No, what we're trying to do is isolate the issue of a heat point source affecting the atomised stream of chromatic ink particles and causing a register shift.\" \n***DUMMY MODE ON*** \n\"You what?\" \n\"The heat coming out of the printer changes the colour between the jet and the page.\" \n\"Oh, right\" \n*** DUMMY MODE OFF *** \nEight minutes later... \n\"Okay, so I've powered it down for 10 min..\" \n\"No, it was only 7 minutes 30,\" I say. \n>click< \n10 minutes, 23 second later.. \n\"Okay I've switched it on and it's still printing the wrong colour.\" \n\"Did you still have the colour calibration card?\" \n\"What colour calibration card?\" \n\"The one that came with the printer,\" I lie, knowing full well that everything that came with the printer would have been binned years ago. \"It will have the words DO NOT DISCARD printed at the top.\" \n\"Uh... no.\" \n\"Ok, well do you have a metal pen with ink of standard blue?\" \n\"My Mont Blanc?\" \n\"Perfect.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\">Sigh< We're trying to find a quality pen with a standardised colour which hasn't been exposed to extremes of heat that would have resulted in an asymmetric chromatic shift. Plastic pens don't have the heat-conductive characteristics that would result in a symmetric colour shift, so they'd have a graduated change.\" \n*** DUMMY MODE ON *** \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Metal pens get warm all over whereas plastic ones get warm in one place. If there's been a colour change we need it to be standard over the cartridge.\" \n\"Oh.\" \n*** DUMMY MODE OFF*** \n\"So whip the refill out because we need to expose it to a tiny amount of heat at the tip.\" \n\"Why?\" \nBecause we're going to get the tip of it warm so that we can compare the colour shift in terms of chromatic gradient over a standardised test pattern which should exhibit the same predictable colour shift as the pre-jet ink reservoir. \n*** DUMMY MODE ON*** \n\"Uh huh.

Partly because I don't like the idea of exponentially increasing the number of devices I'll have to support for no good reason, but also because the Boss has absolutely no idea of what the hell he's talking about. \n\"Oh, the INTERNET of THINGS,\" I say, nodding, \"When you said Internet of Things I thought you meant the internet of things.\" \n\"?\" \n\"Are you guys talking about the Internet of Things?\" the PFY asks, stalking over after having picked up on my saying the same thing three times in quick succession – our Bat Signal for an exciting new opportunity to make someone cry. \n\"Yes!\" the Boss says, sensing a kindred spirit in the PFY. \n\"Oh that's a great idea!\" the PFY gushes. \"What were you wanting to use it on?\" \n\"You know: things!\" the Boss says. \"We could use it on things in the office.\" \n\"YES!\" the PFY blurts, escalating his excitement even more - if that's possible. \"What things in the office?\" \n\"The sky's the limit!\" the Boss responds, catching the excitement buzz. \"Where do you think we should start?\" \nOrdinarily, about now I would put the slipper in and force the Boss to admit that he can't think of ONE SINGLE THING in the office that could possibly benefit from being on the internet but the PFY is obviously one for playing the long game. \n\"I don't know.\" the PFY replies, returning the Boss's serve with a quick: \"There are so many possibilities. What's your favourite?\" \n\"Like you said,\" the Boss responds. \"There's just too many things! Why don't we just implement a test project?\" \n\"Yes,\" the PFY says. \"What about something that maybe uses wireless connectivity, maybe a GPS, an accelerometer and... I dunno, maybe some contact input.\" \n\"Yes,\" the Boss says, not knowing what the hell the PFY is proposing. \"I KNOW!\" the PFY says. \"What about - as a test - something that just maps where our security guards are in the building from the GPS chip, how fast they're moving from the accelerometer chip and maybe a hall effect device to count how many times they scratch their arse? We could clip the device on the back of their belt.\" \n\"Would it work?\" \n\"Well the GPS signal might not work inside the building, and they have the inertia of a dwarf star so the accelerometer is probably not going to read anything at all and they spend most of their time on their chair or on the bog, so no, probably not.\" \n\"Hmm,\" the Boss says, thinking hard. \"What about inside the office?\" ` \n\"Let's see. I could put a wireless device that would tell you when the light was on, but your internal wall has glass in it. Or maybe I could tell you when the main door was open - but then again you can see that from your chair if you lean back.\" \n\"What about the coffee machine? You could build something to tell when the water is hot.\" \n\"It's always hot,\" I say. \"It's got an internal boiler.\" \n\"What level the beans are!\" the Boss snaps back. \n\"The bean hopper is, as you can see, transparent.\" \n\"How many cups have been made today!\" \n\"Have you ever heard the expression 'To an idiot with a hammer everything looks like a nail'?\" I ask. \n\"WELL WHAT DO YOU BLOODY SUGGEST?\" the Boss snaps. I have to say it – I'm starting to get a little irritated. Now I don't mind the idea of geeky things – in fact I love the idea. But what I suspect will happen is that everything that moves or does something in the office will get a helpful IoT sensor slapped onto it. Even THAT I don't care too much about, but what I do care about is when they start crapping out and I'm expected to fix them. \nThe problem is that currently the average, everyday jump-on-the-bandwagon IoT platform is typically powered by either 1. a shoddily slapped-together switch mode power supply sourced from the developing world in batches of 1,000 and with an intended service life in the low hours, OR 2. a shoddily slapped-together battery pack containing several dodgy Lithium Ion batteries with dangerously thin battery wal... \n\"How about a personal fitness and health tracker?\" I suggest. \n\"You mean like my fitbit?\" the Boss says, holding up his left hand. \n\"Yes, but better. One that can tell you how fast you accelerate. One that – with the right sensors – could tell you about how good your posture is during the day. One that could – again with the right sensors – tell you if you've received enough sunlight to counter the effects of seasonal affective disorder...\" \n\"I...\" \n\"AND ONE which could analyse your dietary intake. Hell, we could even rig it up with interactive eyeglass camera system with a HUD and in-ear, plus mic, all plugged into a voice command interface.\" \n\"You could do that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"With available hardware – probably,\" I say. \"It would be a test device obviously. The battery system would be a little hefty to start with to support all those systems – otherwise you'd be charging them all day. But over time we could shrink it all down with low power devices.\" \n\"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" the PFY gasps. \"The opportunities to learn from this?!\" \nI have no idea what the PFY's thinking and the only learning I'm thinking about is where the Boss gets a crash course in 1. thermal runaway after a particularly chummy slap on the battery belt from an IT professional, and 2. the foolishness of letting an IT professional rivet the buckle of a battery belt closed \"to stop it accidentally opening\" ... \nYes. \nYes, that will do nicely... I might see if the PFY can slap that tracker on him too... \n"}

Did you get it from a pound shop in a box of 10?\" \n\"I paid 85 quid for this when it first came out!\" the Boss says proudly, as if owning IT antiquity was one of those positive character traits like giving to the poor. \n\"So it just stopped working?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No, sometimes it just gets hot and stops working.\" \n\"So it's stuffed?\" I ask. \n\"No, it was working, but would get hot - and once it gets hot it disappears from My Computer.\" \n\"Because it's stuffed,\" the PFY adds. \n\"No, it's working!\" \n\"But it doesn't stay working?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"So it's stuffed,\" I say, entering the fray. \"And now you want to get your data back?\" \n\"...Yes.\" \n\"And you didn't save it on your desktop?\" \n\"No, I was working on it from home.\" \n\"And you didn't save it on your home machine either?\" \n\"My laptop? No, I wanted to be sure I'd have it for work.\" \n\"So you kept on working on it, even when you knew it was stuffed?\" \n\"IT WASN'T STUFFED!\" \nThe item concerned is everything you'd expect - attached to a massive bunch of keys and with a usb interface half full of pocket lint. \n\"...Isn't this the one you asked me to look at a couple of months back?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I...\" the Boss responds. \n\"The one you'd bent over to an angle of about 45 degrees?\" \n\"No. No, it's just one that looks like it.\" \n\"It bloody IS!\" I say, holding it up against the flat side of the display to show him \n\"Yes well, that one's a little bit bent\" he admits. \n\"How many times have you bent it?\" I ask, already knowing the answer. \n\"Maybe a couple of times. But it always straightens out.\" \n\"So you've got a USB key with an intermittent failure – possibly mechanical – which heats up if you use it too long and which you've had for several years?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And you don't want just replace it?\" \n\"It's got a titanium case!\" \n\"And?\" \n\"They said it was bulletproof!\" \n\"It may be, but it's still stuffed. Though....\" the PFY adds. \n\"Though?\" the Boss asks, beating me to it. \n\"Well, if it's metal we could put a heatsink onto it - you know, to give you time to get your data off...\" \n. . . \nSo the Boss is accessing his drive which has now got a CPU heatsink and fan attached to each side and is starting to droop a little out the top of his desktop's USB port. \n\"It's working, it's woooooorrrrrrrkkkkkkkiiiiiiing!\" the Boss gasps \"Oh, it's gone.\" \n\"PELTIER!\" the PFY snaps. \n\"What?\" the Boss asks. \n\"He's going to use a Peltier device,\" I explain. \"It's a thing that gets hot on one side and cool on the other. So he's suggesting we clamp the cool sides of a couple of peltiers to either side of your key, clamp a couple of heatsinks to the hot sides and then clamp some fans to the heatsinks.\" \n\"Will it work?\" \n\"Like a charm!\" \nA quarter-hour later the Boss' USB stick is connected to his machine by a USB extension cable - mainly because the combined weight of peltiers, larger heat sinks and larger fans would've toppled his tower over if the USB interface hadn't broken off first. \n\"All right...\" The PFY says. \"Ready...... >CLICK< GO!\" \nThe Boss scrabbles away feverishly with his mouse, clicking like his life depended on it. \n\"No...\" he says. \"I'm not seeing anything - it keeps asking me if I want to format the device.\" \n\"Not to worry,\" the PFY says, cranking the current and voltage up \"Try now.\" \n\"No, still saying do I want to format...\" \n\"Okay,\" the PFY replies, winding the current and voltage knobs to the proverbial 11 position. \n\"What about now?\" \n\"No!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Give it a minute for the temperature to settle...\" \n\"Nothing...\" the Boss says, in running-commentary mode. \"Still nothing... Now the USB icon has disappeared completely!\" \n\"Yes, that'll be the USB interface rediscovering the device,\" I say. \n\"Yes!\" the Boss says. \"Is it there? Do I need to do something with the device manager or something? Or will it come up automatically?\" \nI love this stream-of-consciousness stuff. It's a real insight into the mind of middle management, and yet it's only focussed on the visual senses. \n\"Should I unplug it and plug it in again do you think?\" the Boss asks. Or maybe I need to... \nWhat's that smell? \nAaaaaand there we go. \n\"That's the smell of a Peltier burning out,\" I say. \"And if I'm not mistaken, the smell of titanium USB stick melting from the inside.\" \n\"What!? But you said you'd connect the cool side! I checked!\" \n\"Oh, look,\" the PFY says \"I accidentally reversed the polarity.\" \n\"STOP IT! QUICKLY! COOL IT DOWN!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Well the only way we can cool it down quickly will be to bring it into contact with something cool with a dense thermal mass I guess,\" I suggest. \n\"DO IT!\" the Boss shouts. \nSurprising how much thermal mass there is in the cool head of a hammer. Sadly the Boss' USB stick didn't survive the \"cooling\" process though. \n\"Look on the bright side,\" I say as the Boss peels his flatted USB stick off the benchtop. \"At least you can be sure that it's stuffed.\" \nHe's definitely not a glass-half-full man... \n"}

He doesn't have it in for the BOFH, honest","Link":"\/2016\/06\/09\/gene_kim_says_keep_the_bofh\/","Content":"One of the architects of DevOps has said being a 900-year-old organisation with a mainframe is no barrier to overhauling your technology operations, even if you're a European outfit that hasn’t seen a green field development since the 19th century. \nHowever, Gene Kim, author of DevOps cult classic The Phoenix Project, did give us a slight scare by suggesting that adopting DevOps would make all tech employees’ lives easier, to the extent even the BOFH would no longer have anything to be angry about. \nSceptics will argue that adopting DevOps, Agile, and other California-baked paradigms, might be a cinch at smaller startups or companies like Google or Amazon with virtually unlimited cash to build over any greenfield site they choose. Traditional organisations, by comparison, will always have to struggle with years of legacy technology and hierarchy, as well as the immediate business problem. \nKim, speaking to us ahead of his debut conference in the UK, The DevOps Enterprise Summit, accepted this, saying: “So much of the narrative is around the unicorns – Google, Facebook, Amazon.” \nBut he continued, research he has conducted with Jez Humble, showed “The same principles and patterns are emerging in large complex organisations, like lv, HMRC and News UK.” (All of whom will be speaking at the conference , unsurprisingly.) \n“These are organisations that have been around for over a century [or more] and are getting these same miraculous outcomes typically only achieved by Facebook, Google, and Amazon.” \nThe majority of technology workers are in organisations that look more like lv or Barclays than they do like Google, he said, hence upgrading their development and deployment processes, would mean “elevation of productivity that would result in macroeconomic level changes.” \nAnd it doesn't necessarily mean junking all the legacy infrastructure. \n“We can make every engineer, whether dev, test, ops, infosec, as productive as if they were working at a Google, Amazon and Netflix,” said Kim. The mind boggles at what could happen if HMRC was as efficient at extracting cash from taxpayers as Amazon. \nGiven the traditional nature of such organisations, though, many might assume these changes are best achieved by stealth. DevOps acolytes often like to talk about bottom-up revolutions. Not so fast, argues Kim: an analysis of speakers at the conferences showed the three top titles were director of ops, director of development, or chief architect. \nThe last was particularly eye-catching, he said. “At Tripwire [where Kim was a co-founder] we were always trained to ignore the architects. They were ones who just draw pretty pictures in Visio once a year then go back to their ivory tower.” \nThat the architects were driving transformation was a surprise, he said. “In these large organisations that are so functionally oriented, often the only people who see the end to end problem are the architects – everyone else, they just see the tickets coming out of the ticketing machine and say ‘hey I don’t see a problem’.” \nTalking of ivory towers, Kim added that, to US eyes, European organisational culture at first might appear more staid and hierarchical. \nBut, he continued, there is “no doubt in my mind they are as radical and irreverent in these case studies as in the States.” \nThe problems are usually universal, and so should the solutions, he said. “It’s about the technical practices and having an architecture that allows small teams to independently develop, test and deploy their code and deliver value to customers, and that transcends national boundaries and continents.” \nJust to underline Kim’s grasp of British tech culture, he mentions that a lot of people made a connection between his book The Phoenix Project and the Reg ’s own Bastard Operator from Hell – the latter of which obviously predates the DevOps wave. \n“The ops of DevOps is really creating those systems where we create those people – when people are trapped in a system that [produces] failure, studies have shown that [the result is] fatigue, burnout and cynicism. I think we’ve all met people like the Bastard Operator.” \nSo, Kim will feel his mission is complete when The Reg feels compelled to retire the BOFH? “Oh, I would never do that…” \nWhich is just as well. Because if the BOFH didn’t exist, we’d only have to invent him. ® \n"}

Every now and then someone thinks that because computers are getting smaller there must be a stack of room available for them in our area that they can repurpose. \n\"We use it for storing stuff,\" I say. \n\"Well perhaps we could take a quick look. Maybe just measure out the area. See if it's being used properly...\" the consultant suggests, decreasing his life expectancy by an order of magnitude in the process. \n... \n\"See, packed!\" I say to the Boss after a bit of discussion about the merits of inspecting the room. \n\"What's all this paper?\" he gasps. \n\"What do you mean? Do you have any idea of how much paper this place goes through in a month?\" I ask. Defeated, the consultant wanders off, but the Boss has something on his mind. \n\"Doesn't every department order their own paper?\" he asks, after a reasonable amount of thought. \n\"Yes, they often do,\" I admit. \n\"Tell him,\" the PFY murmurs in the background. \n\"So... if they're ordering it... why do you have so much?\" \n\"Tell him,\" the PFY repeats. \n\"We have specialty paper. The paper that people don't use often, but need occasionally. And when they do, we have it.\" \n\"US Legal?\" the Boss asks, looking at one of the boxes. \"Do we even use US Legal?\" \n\"We CAN\" , I say, \"By simply adjusting a tray in a printer. So if someone needed to send a document - say to the US - in US legal format, we would have the paper.\" \n\"TELL him,\" the PFY insists. \n\"A3 Wide. What's A3 Wide?\" the Boss asks, fingering a large box on a mini-pallet. \n\"TELL HIM!\" the PFY snaps. \nBut I'm not going to. \n\"He can't help himself,\" the PFY blurts to the Boss. \"Whenever the paper supplier has an end run, they mis-cut some paper or they just have crap that no-one is buying, they sell it to us. Or rather, Giselle sells it to him .\" \n\"Giselle?\" the Boss asks. \n\"It's true. I'm powerless against her,\" I admit after some prompting from the Boss. \n\"What is it that she has on you?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Nothing.\" \n\"Is she attractive?\" \n\"A bit, but not overly.\" \n\"So she manipulates you into buying?\" \n\"Apparently,\" I admit. \n\"Is it some sort of hypnosis thing?\" \n\"Not that I know of.\" \n\"Then why do you buy?\" \n\"I don't know. But it's a joy to watch.\" \n\"So you're being manipulated?\" \n\"I guess so.\" \n\"You know what your problem is?\" the Boss says. \n\"No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.\" \n\"Your mind has been programmed. Like an obsessive compulsive, every time you give in you reinforce the idea that you can't NOT give in. You need help,\" he says. \n\"On so many levels,\" the PFY adds unkindly. \n\"And there's a course you can go on - called Unlocking the Power of Me .\" \n\"Can't I just jump out of a sixth floor window?\" I ask. \n\"Look, I went on it and it did wonders for me. It's really good. They empower you to work for yourself and not for others.\" \n\"Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhh, Nah.\" I say. \n\"Would you rather I took this through some formal process on deliberately wasting company money?\" \n... \nSo I'm at this course, and it's everything you'd expect from a presenter with O-levels in Psychology and Hugging, a did-not-complete in Reality and an A-level in talking bollocks. \n\"..and I sense that you need to be aware of the precursors to you being exploited\" he says to me, in the second hour of a seemingly endless 'Group-Thought' session. \"You could be right - but how am I to achieve this?\" I ask, noting that I have 25 minutes remaining until I can nip across the road to the pub for lunch without raising concern about my self-medication habit. \n\"I think the root of your problem may be that your acceptance of manipulation might be a result of a suppressed sense of achievement.\" \n\"I suppose there are some things I have yet to do - a bucket list if you will.\" \n\"And THERE YOU ARE! So what we want to do is Empower the You to follow your dreams - because as we know, dreams are simply the upwelling of repressed desires.\" \n\"Fair enough. Though one of my recurring dreams is that I take an axe to people who annoy me with pseudo science and huggy-feely mumbo-jumbo in a course that I've been made to attend against my will. Does anyone else have those dreams?\" \nThere's a show of hands in the room and I know I am not alone. \"But when I say axe, I mean hatchet, because I couldn't fit an axe in my bag this morning...\" \nAnd this is the bit where my dream could turn into someone else's nightmare... Luckily though, it all turned out OK once I'd managed to tell one of my fellow attendees that his dreams of retribution were perhaps better repressed and that maybe he'd like to put the box of matches away, let the petrol fumes subside and let the presenter out of the cupboard - so that he could sign our Power Plus Achievement certificates and we could have an early pub lunch before graduating early. \nAnd rubbish though it was, I think I got something out of the exercise, which I put to use almost immediately. \nOkay Giselle, so that's a pallet of black A4 photocopy paper, 10 cartons of 'almost A4', but only \na pallet of 'double-sided' A2 - even if we don't actually have a printer that can fit it. \nI'm feeling empowered. \nWe had this sales rep who worked for a large three letter minicomputer company back in the day - and she would on occasion take our top people out for lunch. Around 50 per cent of the time this would result in an expensive platform upgrade - and which on one occasion actually involved the subsequent purchase of a 20K 'supervisor machine' on top of the original kit because - as we found halfway to delivery - the machine would not boot without it.

Mostly error logs but also the windows event logs that you extended the size of dramatically - yet even they aren't large enough to keep more than a couple of months of the errors that have been accumulating over the years.\" \n\"So can you fix it?\" \n\"If by FIX you mean make the errors stop, then no. But if you mean enough to make the machine complete a boot before the apocalypse, then probably.\" \nOne logfile purge, disk clean and defrag later, the machine is, well, still crap, but at least it's running fast enough that the pointer actually tracks mouse movement, albeit with a noticeable delay. \n\"Where's the server kept?\" I ask. \n\"Just there\" he says, pointing under his desk at a G2 Proliant Tower with more dust in it than a 1950s Electrolux. \n\"I take it back, you're stuffed.\" I say. \n\"We just need it to run for another month or so,\" he whines. \n\"At this point I'm advocating prayer as a service tool;\" I say \"given that you're witnessing a miracle that the machine is running at all.\" \n\"So it'll keep running?\" \n\"Barring a disk failure, power supply fault, capacitor breakdown, memory error, infinitesimal - or greater - power spike, sudden tremor caused by someone dropping a sheet of paper on the case, a change in aircon temperature or some other microscopic change to the environment.\" \n\"Oh good.\" \n\"The licensing issues are another story though. This is the sort of large-scale licence abuse that generally sails under the Jolly Roger ensign.\" \n\"You've lost me.\" \n\"You probably bought two licences back in the day and just left it at that didn't you?\" the PFY asks. \"Before you bought everything else?\" \nBut this line of questioning is pointless. The whole site has been set up by someone who read the first two sections of \"Migrating to Server 2003\" before giving up. The two sections in question being the Index and Introduction. \n\"So why does it only need to stay running for a month?\" I ask \"The Company goes bankrupt after the piracy prosecution?\" \n\"No, we're migrating to Server 2012 and Windows 10, then Server 2016 in November.\" \n\"You mean you're installing, not migrating,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"What's the difference?\" \n\"Well to use a real world analogy, an install is where you get a new set of drawers and buy new office products like pens, tape, rulers, notepads and staplers to put into them.\" \n\"Oh, and migrating is like when you move all the items from your old set of drawers?\" he asks. \n\"No, in this case migrating is like dropping a smoking grogan into each drawer before setting it on fire and kicking it into your Boss' office.\" I respond. \n\"I..?\" \n\"It is a steaming turd,\" the PFY explains helpfully. \"You don't want to be putting that turd into new equipment.\" \n\"But we'll lose all our files.\" \n\"Move the files, just not the domain. Create a new, clean domain from scratch.\" \n\"What do I do with the old domain?\" \n\"Do you know someone with a crucifix, some holy water, a wooden stake and a bath of acid?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Then chuck it in the bin.\" \n\"Well, can you give me some pointers on installing Server 2012 and Windows 10?\" \n\"Yeah, get an expert to do it.\" I say, nodding to the PFY as I leave. \nThe Boss is still in a bad mood - more so now that the Director has given him a bollocking for our not helping their IT guy install Server 2012. \n\"So I want you to go back and sort it out for him!\" he snaps. \"Just get it done!\" \n\"We'll need some tools,\" the PFY says. \n\"And?\" the Boss snaps again. \n\"Lots of tools\" I add \"As we'll need to desynchronise the replication engine, backrate the diagnostic platform and then recalibrate the entire system infrastructure.\" \n\"And why are you telling me this?\" \n\"Because we'll need the van. To carry the tools.\" \n\"When?\" \n\"I dunno - what time will you be popping across the street for lunch?\" the PFY asks. \n"}

'Free Upgrade'","Link":"\/2016\/07\/22\/bofh_2016_episode_10\/","Content":"Episode 10 \"I TOLD you, I HATE working on printers!\" I seethe at the Boss. \n\"It's just a bit of configuration,\" he wheedles, trying to make me feel better. \n\"It's not a bit of bloody configuration, it's translation - from IT into printer manufacturer speak.\" \nThe Boss is in a pickle. The printer company cretin came crawling around and used the words \"free upgrade\" and the Boss fell for it - so now the IT department has 13 new printers destined for all 4 corners of the company clogging up the hallway - or 14 if you count the one beside the Boss's desk that the cretin installed before running away. \n\"I'm not with you?\" the Boss says. \n\"These things,\" I say, pointing at the multifunction printer concerned, \"are rubbish.\" \n\"No they're great. They've got lots of new functionality!\" \n\"They're great at printing. They can manage a decidedly average scan. They're crap at faxes - but who cares. They are SH*T, however, at IT,\" I rage. \n\"The one by my office works,\" the Boss argues. \n\"Because the inbred cretin at the printer company installed it! It took him 3 DAYS!\" \n\"That was only because he needed to know the right settings from us, then he had to calibrate the colours, reset the counters and then align the printer with the workflow.\" \n\"ALIGN THE PRINTER WITH THE WORKFLOW!\" I shout, in serious risk of blowing one of the veins in my forehead. \"If they manufactured the 'upgraded' printer with the same paper flow it wouldn't NEED to be realigned.\" \nThe Boss has touched a nerve. The new printer needs access from THREE SIDES instead of just the front which means it no longer fits into its purpose-built recess and now sits in the middle of the room with power and data cables dangling out of an open ceiling tile. To make matters worse in its current position it blows warm air directly at the aircon thermostat - trigging cooling mode - so I'm getting complaints that the office is too cold. \n\"It's an upgrade,\" the Boss says like its the XYZZY of stupid IT arguments. \n... \n\"Look, how about you just take a look at it? If you can get it going, great - if not we can leave it for the engineer. He's on another job right at the moment though, but should be here within the next hour or two.\" \n\"OK,\" I respond. \n\"So you'll do it?\" \n\"No, I'll leave it for the engineer.\" \n\"Are you sure you don't want to have a quick look? He's left the password.\" \n\"Is it 123456?\" \n\"No. No, it's 111111. I thought you'd be quite keen on it. It has some very advanced features. Scan to Email, Scan to USB, Scan and Hold, Print and Hold...\" the Boss says, reeling off the list that talked him into agreeing to an update in the first place. \n\"It looks ok on paper but once you get into the configuration interface you realise how absolutely awful it is.\" \n\"What is?\" the PFY says, wandering into the room dragging a step ladder behind him. \n\"Those new multifunction printers.\" \n\"Oh THEY ARE CRAP!\" the PFY blurts. \"EVERY SINGLE TIME you change a setting the thing has to reboot. But the good news is the web interface doesn't expire or seemingly verify cookies so you can go straight back into the admin screen - even days later.\" \n\"That's nothing,\" I counter. \"To configure print accounting you have to turn on authentication and then import all the users from Active Directory then MANUALLY give each of them a PIN number ONE AT A F*CKING TIME, *EACH* time having to go through the Print Accounting, Print User, Reset PIN menus.\" \n\"So you got Active Directory going then?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No, it just says 'Incompatible Version' and dies. In the end I turned off LDAP which turned on a previously hidden 'CSV import' option, exported AD to their CSV template then imported all the users - but gave up when the import procedure wouldn't recognise a column name from its own bloody template file!\" \n\"Still, the scan to USB is great!\" the PFY says. \n\"Is it?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Nah. You put your USB stick in and it craps itself if your drive is not FAT formatted.\" \n\"Why not try scan to email?\" the boss suggests. \n\"It doesn't have an option to send to servers requiring SMTP authentication. Whereas our cloud mail...\" \n\"Scan and hold?\" the Boss continues. \n\"100% usable,\" the PFY says. \"I tried that after scan to usb. You scan your document to the internal hard drive and you can pick it up from the web interface. If you know your User Code. And your User ID. And your PIN number. Only one of which were the credentials you used to perform the scan in the first place.\" \n\"Couldn't you look into it?\" the Boss asks, trying to pass the poison chalice to the PFY \n\"Nah, I have to run the new cabling to all the new printer locations,\" he sighs, picking up the ladder and heading out. \n\"And I have to help him,\" I say, ducking out with him. \n. . . \n\"I don't know why you don't like these babies\" the printer cretin says happily - no doubt thinking of the commission he's just rogered us out of with a new per-page printing cost. \"They are state of the art.\" \n\"If the art concerned is fingerpainting,\" I concur grabbing the cable that the PFY hands me out of the roofspace. \n\"They've got Scan to Email, Scan to...\" \n\"Let me stop you right there,\" I say. \"They've got buttons that say that, but functionality unable to deliver it. So be honest, why the hell did we get these printers?\" \n\"Because they're an upgrade!\" \n\"But they're not an upgrade are they? They're some model which was bought in error that you didn't want to pay a restocking fee on - so you moved them on to us.\" \n\"We sold your contract on\" he admits with the smugness that only comes from a watertight signed contract. \"We had another more important customer who wanted your existing printers and these were the only things we could lay our hands on at short notice. Oh, and you'll need to install new drivers for all your users.\" \n\"Well install your own bloody cables then!\" the PFY shouts from inside the ceiling cavity, stomping down the ladder. \n\"No need to be like that!\" the cretin sniffs, climbing the ladder. \nThe PFY opens the window. \nI push the ladder. \nI pull the ladder. \nThe PFY closes the window. \n"}

I guess... when one of our atypical difficult users comes in. \n\"Just one question,\" he starts, interrupting the thought I started when he walked in on potential loopholes in the gun laws. \"My browser has an icon which is red.\" \n\"What's the icon?\" I ask, feigning... well everything. Interest, professionalism, the will to live, you name it. \nThere are three very broad categories of user in my vast experience: \nGroup 2 has two subcategories \nThe only people worse than a 2b is a 1b - People who don't know what they are doing but don't want to take any risks - who will come and ask you about EVERY BLOODY MESSAGE BOX, WINDOW, WARNING, UNUSUAL BROWSER PAGE, TASKBAR BALLOON, ETC that comes their way. \nEVERY. SINGLE. ONE. \n\"I'm just concerned it might be a virus,\" he murmurs. \nAnd EVERYTHING is probably potential virus... \n\"Did you take a picture of it?\" I ask, trying to buy myself some time to send a text message to the PFY telling him the Swedish Volleyball Team is in Mission Control looking for him before making myself scarce... \n\"Yes I did!\" he says, showing me a blurred picture on his phone. \n\"That's just an icon to tell you your browser needs updating,\" I say. “Nothing to be worried about at all. \n\"Well yes, but the internet has been running a bit slowly recently.\" \n\"Did you call Vint Cerf?\" I ask. \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"Nothing. When we update your browser it'll go away.\" \n\"Oh. And when can you do that? I've got a meeting in 5 minutes so I'll be away from my desk for an hour or so.\" \n\"Oh I'm sorry, I have some other installs that have become urgent,\" I lie. \n\"After lunch then?\" \n\"Hmmm, I'll just check the Helpdesk Queue and see if there's anything else urgent.\" \n>tappity< \n\"Oh, look,\" I say, pointing at the screen. “There’s about 100 urgent jobs stacked up in there. \n\"That one's from 2008!\" he gasps, almost discovering the secret of my outstanding urgent-job queue - Never, EVER close a job. \n\"Well it must be REALLY urgent by now,\" I reply. \"Better get right on it!\" \n\"Tomorrow?\" \n\"Not looking great.\" \n\"This week?\" \n\"Mmmmmmm,\" I sigh doubtfully. \n\"Next Week?!\" he gasps. \nWe'll give it a crack - but no promises. \n\"Partly this is my own fault for isolating him from the update cycle as he did tend to go heavily 1b every time an automatic update was rolled out and his box told him it had rebooted to complete the install - Because it's probably a virus. Or a \" hacker . \nThe other vexing thing about 1bs - and this guy in particular - is that he'll dash up to tell you that the Google picture has changed and \"it's probably a website virus\" yet he'll still spend his lunchtimes browsing an obscure hobby discussion board which is about 95 per cent zero-day exploits and 5 per cent content on his work desktop. \nI realise that it's probably time to update the image that gets flashed to his box every Monday and maybe verify that the scanning software that filters his file-sharing is up to date. Meantime, though, I just need him out of the office. \n“You say the internet was slow – was it faster or slower than your personal laptop?” I ask, putting a crowbar in the lid of Pandora’s Box and pushing real hard. \nI recall he once asked me to give his personal laptop a once-over to see if it needed more memory and I recall that the memory and cpu consumption was about 30 per cent browser toolbars, 30 per cent malware and 40 per cent virus scanners, all playing a massive game of Last Man Standing. \nHe asked if we could plug it into our work network to do some updates because his home network seemed rather slow, but I didn’t want our mail gateway to implode from the influx of IPS warnings so accidentally nudged his machine out the office window that hadn’t been open about 30 seconds earlier. \n“Oh, and can you check my desktop clock – I think it’s two minutes slow,” he asks. \n“You... have a watch, right?” \n“Yes but...” \n“And a cell phone with a clock on the start screen?” \n“Yes, but…” \n“And a desk phone with the time on it?” \n“YES, but...” \n“And isn’t there a clock on your office wall?” \n“YES, but as I said...” \n“And don’t you have a little clock built into that multifunction keyboard?” \n“Yes, but the clock on my computer isn’t right.” \n“You know addition, right?” \n“That’s not the point. What happens if my outgoing mail is sent too late?” \n“In actual fact, if your clock was slow it would appear as if your mail was early.” \n“It may do, but you know this has happened before.” \n“Yes, clocks deviate in time. Some machines don’t track time well when they are off. Some don’t sync with the server properly, some are just standalone – it all depends on how it was configured.” \n“So you don’t think it was a virus?” \n“Hmmm, I’ve never considered that. Perhaps I should check the big dictionary of viruses.” \n“You have a big dictionary of viruses?” \n“Sure, it’s over there on the bookcase.” \n“And you don’t have an online version?” \n“Oh, that’s just what they like us to do. So they could infect it.” \n“So you’ll look it up?” \n“No time like the present. \n>flip< >flip< \nAh HA! There is a clock virus - you’re right.” \n“Can I see?” \n“Yes, but the light’s a bit crap over here. Come over to the window, it’ll be much clearer there...” \n"}

I..\" he mumbles confused \"If I.. hit my face on the desk why is there no blood there?\" \n\"You fell!\" I said to the Boss again as I once more help him to his feet \"And you hit your face on the desk!\" \n\"Oh. What was I doing before that?\" \n\"You were talking about the time you crapped your pants while reading a fitness mag at WH Smiths,\" the PFY says, unable to stop himself. \"Maybe you have low blood sugar or something.\" \nI help the Boss back into his office while the PFY cleans up his desktop. \nAll to no avail of course. Within a couple of hours the Boss has emailed everyone the link to the bottom-feeders who make a living off talking companies into getting web-based personality tests for their staff. He's even gone as far as sprinkling the words \"team-player\" and \"mandatory\" in the email. \n\"I just want to assure you that there are no wrong answers in these questionnaires,\" the Boss says calmly the next morning. \"We're just interested in the ways we all work so that we can create future project teams with people suited to working with each other. The whole company's doing it - not just I.T.\" \nWhile the survey has some initial teething problems (the PFY intercepting the site's DNS lookup and pointing it at his web server with a \"Currently Overloaded\" message) I point a website copier at the real server. \nSure enough, the whole thing is a set of rubbish web pages with a pathetically simplistic analysis engine in the backend which churns out \"complementary match groups\" at a click of a button from the admin page. \nAn admin page which is accessed by appending \"\/admin\" to the questionnaire URL, as it happens. \n...that afternoon... \n\"..I mean what does this even MEAN!?\" the Boss snaps harshly as he tries to fill in his online form. \n\"What does what mean?\" I ask. \n\"If I could be any kind of flower, I'd be... a potato\" the Boss reads \"And the rating goes from Agree to Strongly Agree - but there's NO DISAGREE!\" \n\"Perhaps it's using meta information?\" I suggest. \n\"What?\" \n\"Maybe it's not the question that they're testing you with - maybe it's the amount of time you take to answer the question.\" \n\"So a long time would be bad?\" \n\"How long have you been looking at it?\" \n\"I don't know - I refreshed the page a couple of times in case the Disagree was missing.\" \n\"In that case choose Strongly Agree.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Well they probably think you're a vegetable if it's taken you that long to answer a simple question so you may as well get a rating for honesty.\" \n>clicky< \n\"I am frequently upset by questions I can't answer that might highlight my lack of competence Agree to Strongly agree - but STILL no disagree.\" \n\"Strongly agree,\" I suggest. \n\"WHAT!?\" \n\"So you're saying you're not upset by this? You sound upset.\" \n\"It's this stupid questionnaire!\" >clicky< \"I often blame technology for my own shortcomings. IT'S ONLY GOT STRONGLY AGREE!\" \n\"Then click it,\" I say helpfully. \nRerouting the Boss' desktop to the PFY's server for the questionnaire has really paid off... While 99.9 per cent of the company are answering questions about whether they think it's better to be late to a meeting than ill-prepared the Boss is tripping the far reaches of the PFY's vodka fuelled imagination. \n\"As a child I found I preferred to do number twos with the toilet door open?!\" \n\"What're the options?\" I ask. \n\"Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree,\" the Boss Mumbles. >clicky< \n\"And... you're clicking on Strongly Disagree then?\" I ask innocently, with just the faintest whiff of disbelief. \nAnd here's a free pointer about hypnotherapy - if you're going to record your sessions because you're scared that the hypnotist is going to make you take a dump in your drawer every time someone says \"cauliflower\" you should be extra careful not to synchronise the recording to iTunes on your desktop where some mildly bored administrator might find it while trolling for pirated music... \n\"You find you are easily distracted from work by fantasies of sexual encounters with underlings? Is that something they'd even ask?\" \n\"I'm not sure - but then you're the one who mentioned being a team player. What are the?\" \n\"It's just got strongly agree.\" \n\"Well, click it.\" \n\"I don't know about this,\" the Boss says uneasily. \"It just doesn't seem right.\" \n\"If it makes any difference I found some of the questions difficult myself. Besides it's anonymous. And the questions aren't viewed in isolation. And it's not like they're going to email the question and answers out to everyone\" \n...one hour later... \nIf only any of those statements had been true we might still have a Boss now - and not someone who resigned shortly after being called to the Director's office. And to be fair, once people read their email we could be fairly certain that we'd identified that the Boss's personality type wouldn't fit into any group. \nSo it was a little bit useful after all. \n"}

It should just be O.I.A.P.\" \n\"He's saying you're pathetic,\" I say to the Boss. \"I'd hit him!\" \n\"He was not!\" the Boss says, not picking up the vibe of this conversation at all. \"And I WILL not.\" \n\"Suit yourself.\" \n\"The Overarching Information And Architecture Project aims to determine the systems we have, the systems we need and what systems we will need into the future.\" \n\"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"I think I may have temporarily lapsed into a coma - It's a medical condition. I have a note.\" \n\"The OVERARCHING INFORMATION AN..\" \n\"No, you lost me again,\" I interrupt. \"I may need a lie-down.\" \n\"And Overarching bit is a little redundant too isn't it?\" The PFY chips in. \"I mean you could just call it the I.A.P and it would still be the same thing.\" \n\"Just a quick slap,\" I urge the Boss. \"Then really put the slipper in when he goes down. It's the only thing he understands.\" \nThe Boss, however, is maintaining his reserve. \nThere are five main exercises undertaken by managers who don't have the wherewithal to do their job but want to look like they're contributing: A. A Review of \"lessons from the past\" , B. The big push for documentation, C. An anal-gazing \"Look-to-the-future\" exercise, D. Team building and\/or Group Dynamics, or, E. A comprehensive review of something to reach the conclusion they've already thought of. \nSo we're talking about C or E. \nEither way, it's a black hole into which time and energy will be poured whereas the maximum workplace benefit would be derived from nailing the Boss into an airtight soundproof cupboard in the basement with an open drum of calcium chloride for several months. \nIt's a fairly transparent attempt to get rid of everything we have here that he doesn't understand and replace it with some lame version of the same thing which costs four times as much, does half the job but produces a nicely coloured pie graph. So we're probably talking E. \n\"What do you need?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I just need the Committee. I emailed everyone but only got one response.\" \nAnd we all know who the one respondent was - a crawly sycophantic toerag from the Hell Desk who thinks he can suck his way to the top by agreeing with every inane thought which crosses the Boss' mind. \nAllegedly. \nSo it's Catch 22 - If providing input to this process is a drain on your time and will to live, being on the Committee is like being immersed in a jar of turd-scented treacle with a urinal drain as a snorkel. Which accounts for the lack of respondents. \n\"Anyway, I was wondering if one of you two would li..\" \n\"YOU FAINTED!\" I say, kindly, a couple of seconds later \"AND HIT YOUR HEAD!\" \n\"Yes!\" the PFY says, hiding his throbbing hand behind his back. \"Let us help you into a seat.\" \n\"Really?\" the Boss says. \"I thought I was going to ask you if you wanted to...\" \n\"YOU MISSED THE CHAIR!\" I say, a couple of seconds even later, \"AND BANGED YOUR HEAD ON THIS RUGGEDISED LAPTOP.\" \nYou only get a chance to use the old \"master reset\" on a Boss a couple of times in their career before the deja vu kicks in - and if you've got to play that card you may as well play it to get out of being on a Committee. Especially a committee like this one which a scope so open-ended it could see you through to retirement. \n... \nAs it turns out while we dodged a bullet avoiding the committee we collected a 40 pound shell we got slapped onto the working party. Apparently the first thing the newly-formed two-man committee did was create a list of people who would be on the two-man \"working group\" - the PFY and myself. \nSo perhaps one too many master-resets after all. \nNow the Committee of an infrastructure and architecture project has the dubious pleasure of scores of seemingly endless meetings to decide upon a project framework, project goals and project champions before getting down to the real nitty-gritty important stuff of deciding the font to use in the survey document, but the Working Group will be the people who'll actually administer the survey. \nThey'll talk to people individually, collate their responses, analyse those responses against the project framework and present the analysis to the committee so that it can be completely ignored when the Boss does everything he wanted to do in the first place but needed an investigation to support. \n... \n\"...so to give you a bit of background for your questions I thought I'd give you an overview of our EXISTING infrastructure first\" I say to the Boss and sycophant. \"So you have a better idea of what we have and what we do and what to ask.\" \n\"So we've got.... nothing?\" the sycophant says sarcastically, gesturing around the mostly empty room. \n\"Not quite nothing,\" I say, pointing as I step backwards through the door. \"There's that large drum.

I supposed you're right.\" the Boss admits. \n\"And it doesn't matter to me that you have the IT skill level of the monkey they fired at the moon - we're using the term liberally.\" \n\"Like when they use the word 'nutritionist' in a diet advert,\" the PFY says. \"No real certification.\" \n\"Unless we printed you a certificate - and then it would be a \" Certified Nutritionist', I add. \n\"And say they advocate Lard sandwiches as a cure for heart disease,\" the PFY says \"They'd be an INDEPENDENT Certified Nutritionist who has shaken off the mistakes of the past.\" \n\"An Independent NATURAL Certified Nutritionist,\" I add. \n\"What's this got to do with network security? Or that chair?\" the Boss asks. \nOkay, so I want to sell my chair. First thing I do is put the message out there that I'm looking for people who have experienced migraines and headaches from playing first-person-shooters. I'll be flooded with calls from idiotic hypochondriacs like you who think that there's someone out there who will finally listen. \n\"I'll get some survey company to ask you questions like 'Do you think this has affected your overall sense of wellbeing?', 'Do you think that this loss of wellbeing has affected your marriage?' and if you're over 40 'Do you think your health has deteriorated in the 20 years since you played your first person shooter?' Hell, I'd probably check to see if you've had a cancer scare.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because then we can claim that FPS can ruin your sense of wellbeing, end your marriage and - most importantly - claim that first-person-shooters MAY cause cancer.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because then I'll wheel out a chair, shove a couple of magnets in the base of it and - because you're so suggestible - tell you that it should help with your migraines. You - being suggestible - will answer the follow-up question of 'Do you think this chair reduced the symptoms' with a Yes - even if you did get a headache, and suddenly I'm selling a chair endorsed by a certified IT professional with a background in health and usability research.\" \n\"And not a suggestible hypochondriac with the IT skillset of a potato,\" the PFY says. \n\"I still don't see what this has to do with network security?\" \n\"Okay, so this network security company goes out on the web looking for companies who've had idiots open an attachment that encrypts their filesystem. They sift through these companies to find those who don't take backups and\/or virtual machine snapshots. They then sift through those companies for the ones with extremely poor financial performance and ask them how much money they were making in their heyday and how much money they are making now. They subtract B from A, multiply (B-A) by the number of companies that responded and then publish a document that claims that poor network security costs the country 47 billion pounds a year.\" \n\"They find the person who clicked on the attachment in the first place - who is now cleaning toilets in hell - suggest that we should also consider the social cost,\" the PFY adds. \n\"We imply that a patriot would want to take all steps necessary to reduce the risk of this kind of financial loss on the country, we'd pick stacks of examples of companies who have gone to the wall (regardless of whether it was because of IT issues or not), state that the cost is too high and then show you some pictures of children in the third world and ask you if that's what you want for your kids.\" \n\"And then we'd offer you 500 quid antivirus package,\" I say. \"Which you would buy.\" \n\"By clicking on the link in your email,\" The PFY says. \n\"You now owe us 47 billion pounds,\" I say. \nTrue Story: The antivirus coordinator at a place I once worked sent out an IT security CD to all staff - with a virus on it. \n"}

It used to be Medium High, but then I realised that there was no point so I just went to low. One capital, some lowercase, 2 numbers.\" \n\"Like Banana47.\" \n\"Yeah, that was our admin password for about two years.\" \n\"TWO YEARS!!!\" \n\"Yeah, you'd think it'd be an issue but we have people using their surname with an incrementing two digit number – kept on a bit of paper under their keyboards in case they forget their name.\" \n\"Don't you enforce password security?\" \n\"Here?

Pleased to meet you","Link":"\/2017\/02\/24\/bofh_2017_episode_2\/","Content":"Episode 2 There's a small-scale war going on between me, the PFY and the folk in Health and Safety. \nNow your normal, run-of-the-mill person would rather perform a root canal on themselves with a hammer action drill than take on a Health and Safety role in any organisation. The position itself has all the prestige of an unflushed turd and, as such, tends to attract the human version of the blowfly. \nOur particular blowfly has become a royal pain in the arse and will need to be dealt with. \nIn OUR department there's an unspoken rule that the newest employee in has to take over the H&S and Fire Warden roles and as the HellDesk has a higher turnover than the North Korean game-show \"I'm a celebrity, please execute me\" the poison chalice usually ends up being supped by one of those poor bastards - only about a month ago they got someone new who discovered the hidden power of the role and won't pass the chalice on. \nThe person in question has distinguished himself by investigating every Health and Safety incident with a view to establishing SOPs for everyday tasks. For instance our espresso machine. \nThe espresso machine outside Mission Control has only two users - the PFY and myself. It used to have more, but the PFY installed a solenoid which fires up the boiler while simultaneously shunting the pressure switch. When we saw some pleb creeping down the corridor with a coffee cup in his or her hand, the PFY would remotely activate the solenoid causing the relief valve to pop in a frightening discharge of steam which sometimes also triggered a relief valve in the person concerned to pop too. \nOur blowfly's plan of monitoring the pressure gauge and getting the machine fixed will amount to nought given that the needle of the gauge was brazed into the green position by the same coffee machine engineer that advised the PFY about the solenoid trick. \nThis has not stopped his relentless quest for power, however, and now he wants access to the holy of holies: the server room. \n\"Sorry, Operations Staff only,\" I say when he asks. \n\"It's a Health and Safety matter.\" \n\"Yes, that's why it's Operations Staff only,\" the PFY says. \"Surely you understand?\" \n\"I'm doing an audit of the safety of the site,\" he continues, unabated, reaching for his ace-in-the-hole: \"I need access to all IT areas to audit them. It's a workplace H&S requirement.\" \n\"No it's not,\" the PFY says. \"I'm fairly sure it's only a requirement when there has been an incident in the area concerned. There's been no incidents.\" \nIn actual fact, the Server Room could rival a gun range for the blind in Health and Safety incidents, however none of them are in the H&S system - we've checked. And purged. Often. \n\"There are no RECORDED incidents,\" he continues, \"but anecdotal evidence indicates that there have been many incidents.\" \n\"Anecdotal?\" the PFY says. \"You're not listening to the proles are you? Their idea of a Health and Safety incident is when the cafe fries their chips in reduced fat lard!\" \nHe will not be put off however. He wants access, he wants it now, and he wants it permanently to ensure that he can \"proactively manage workplace health and safety guidelines\" . \nIt turns out that he has a list of potential Server Room H&S issues culled from the past two years' worth of incident filings with the authorities - and he wants to inspect every one. \n\"Okay then,\" I say, tapping away at the access control system. \"But I think you're wasting your time.\" \n\"I think we'll both see about that,\" he says, holding his access badge up to the plate. \nDENIED! \n\"I thought you said you'd given me access?\" \n\"I have,\" I respond, \"but you don't have the required competencies to gain access.\" \n\"Competencies - what the hell are you talking about?\" \n\"Surely as a H&S person you know that while you may have ACCESS to a location, you also have to have a current competency for the area concerned.\" \n\"What competencies?!\" \n\"Well, if you want to go on the roof you'll need a Heights competency certification; if you want to go into the Server Room you'll need a Confined Space competency certification; and if there's a contractor working in either location you'll need an Active Worksite certification.\" \n\"What about if you escort me?\" he asks, weaselling his way around my plan B. \n\"Sure, no problems. All you need is a High Vis vest, Protective Boots and a hard hat,\" The PFY responds. \n\"And you have all those things do you?\" he asks sarcastically. \n\"I don't need them - I've got my competency certifications,\" he blurts. \n\"Why the hell would I need them?\" \n\"High Vis so that we know you're around and don't accidentally open a rack door into your face and a hard hat and protective boots so that if something falls on you from height you're not injured.\" \n\"I think we can dispense with them,\" he says drily. \n\"Can't, it's in your S.O.P,\" the PFY says, pointing to a paragraph down the bottom of the blowfly's most recent email about everyone having responsibility to ensure all steps are taken to ensure workspace safety is treated as a priority in their area. \nNow he thinks we're hiding something, so he's even more keen to get his nose up the safety crack. \n\"This >scribble< >scribble< is a note to say that I have been fully advised of the potential risks and that as a Health and Safety Representative I am knowingly waiving the requirements for protective equipment >scribble<. So let's see that room.\" \n... \n\"...so anyway, he opened a rack door which pulled a cable - which in turn moved a ceiling tile..\" the PFY says to the Boss. \n\"...which is when we found the hammer that has obviously been sitting in the ceiling since they replaced the grid several years back.\" \n\"And don't tell me,\" the Boss says, \"even after all those years the hammer still looks like it was only bought this afternoon and is no doubt completely clean of fingerprints?\" \n\"I... don't know about that - that's for the experts to tell,\" the PFY blabs uncomfortably. \n\"That's not the end of the story, is it?\" the Boss asks perceptively. \n\"Well, after the blow to the head, he stepped back through the coned-off area around the lifted floor tiles...\" \n\"The cones perhaps having that new-plastic smell like they were only purchased this afternoon?\" the Boss chips in. \n\"We recirculate air in the server room,\" I counter. \"It can take years for things to lose their odour.\" \n\"And?\" he asks. \n\"And hit his head again,\" the PFY says. \n\"Just once?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No. Three times.\" \n\"Pity.\" He says. \n\"Pity?\" \n\"Yes, the Director had \" sort of fall \", but my money was on halon. I never do well at office sweepstakes.\" \n"}

Brian's a bit of an expert at 9001, having implemented it in a couple of his former workplaces. He'd all but finished his PowerPoint presentation.\" \nI am of the feeling that Brian is actually a bit of an expert at padding out his CV with bullshit given the number of \"Understanding ISO 9001:2008\" documents that have been left on the shared printer over the past week or so. \nPart of me is wondering if there ever WAS a presentation document at all, and there's only one way to find out. \n\"Well, we could use a deletion recovery tool I suppose. Get the deleted data back from his drive.\" \n\"You can't,\" the Boss chips back. \"It's deleted.\" \n\"Yes, it's deleted, but the deletion process is a bit like tearing the index pages out of a book. The content is still there but the index to it isn't. The software just rebuilds an index to deleted content.\" \n\"Yes, but it's deleted,\" the Boss says. \"Secure deleted.\" \n\"Oh you mean like a three pass overwrite?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes,\" the Boss gasps, seeing a way out of the dog-ate-my-homework implosion. \n\"I only ask because we just got some forensic recovery software which can do 3-pass overwrite,\" he says, \"but not 7.\" \n\"I think it might have been 7.\" \n\"Well we can give it a crack anyway,\" I say, reaching for his laptop. \n\"No, I don't think you'll be able to find anything - if you don't have backups,\" the Boss says, trying to change the focus of this conversation. \n\"They may as well try!\" the Director says. \"How long will it take?\" \n\"It can take several hours as it does a bitwise comparison of tesla signatures on the disk surface. It can detect as low as 3 or 4 micro-gauss.\" \nHonestly the PFY can churn complete garbage at the drop of a hat. I'd let him go on but the Boss and Director are already approaching coma-level dummy mode... \n\"So we'll have it by tomorrow's meeting at 2?\" the Director asks. \"I don't want to put the Board off again. I put them off once because of that anonymous bomb threat, but I really can't do that again.\" \n\"Look, I give you my word we'll have that presentation ready for you at the start of the meeting!\" the PFY blurts. \n... Later, in Mission Control... \n\"You know there's no presentation don't you?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"Oh yeah - the Boss'd need to bathe in deodorant to mask that smell of fear.\" \n\"So why did you promise to recover the presentation?\" \n\"A little white lie,\" the PFY says. \"But I give you my word that I will have that presentation by tomorrow at 2!\" \n... \nThe next day at 1:59pm precisely the PFY rocks up outside the boardroom and hands the Boss his laptop. \n\"Found it!\" the PFY gasps. \"Took ages to recover it because of the number of edits you'd made to it. I've really only checked the first 3 or 4 slides but it looks to be all there.\" \nThe Director's ecstatic and the Boss looks like he may have crapped himself. \n\"That introduction to Resource Impacts was inspired!\" the PFY says, and the Boss suddenly cheers up a little - like maybe the PFY put the laptop on his workbench at night and the elves came and created a 40-page PowerPoint presentation for him. \nIn case you're wondering, the elves didn't come at night. The Boss did though, searching high and low for the laptop that he'd presumably be outraged about the theft of. \nIf only the PFY hadn't taken it home with him. \n\"Well, let's get to it,\" the Director says. \n\"Actually, I'm feeling a little... under the weather. Must be something I ate.\" \n\"What a coincidence!\" I say. \"I've got a brand new roll of antacids - guaranteed to settle a bit of pre-presentation nerves!\" \n... \nThe Boss trolls into the meeting like a doomed man, but is surprised to find a number of well detailed, yet easy to understand slides about an ISO9001 implementation plan. Interesting key points and some to-the-point supporting pictures. Then some not altogether to-the-point supporting pictures. \nThen some very disturbing pictures. \nThen some very very disturbing text. \nAnd more very disturbing pictures. \nThen some security guards. \nThen a job vacancy. \n"}

Simon, Steven - this is James,\" the Boss burbles, pushing a young lad forward like a ritual sacrifice candidate. \"James is doing a 2 week placement with us as part of his further studies.\" \n\"James!\" I say, holding out my hand. \n\"James is here to make some modifications to the software that imports people into our security system.\" \nI pull my hand back before James can touch it. \n\"MY software?\" I ask. \n\"The COMPANY'S software,\" the Boss counters. \n\"Written by ME,\" I return. \n\"For the COMPANY,\" The Boss bats back. \"In COMPANY time.\" \n\"What, James is going to learn and modify 53,000 lines of code?\" I ask, unable to remember the number of lines I'd claimed it was in the past. \n\"I thought you said it was 35,000 lines of code?\" the Boss responds. \n\"35,000 lines of the main body - 18,000 lines of utility code and dependencies\" I lie, surprising myself both with my creativity and on-the-fly subtraction skills. \n\"I hope there's a lot of comments,\" James jokes, hoping to defuse the situation. \n\"Oh the code is self-documenting,\" I say, repeating a line taught to me by Hamish Marson in the early '90s. \n\"What does that mean?\" he asks. \n\"Gosh, don't they teach people anything in programming fundamentals these days?\" I sigh, shaking my head and wandering off quickly. \n\"ANYWAY\" the Boss calls out. \"I'll just set James up in the spare office and get him to liaise with you.\" \nWell that's a fly in my otherwise pristine programming ointment! James will shortly find out that the 53 or 35 thousand lines of code which was my sole output for two months a couple of years ago is in fact just over 500 lines of code - the majority of which was cut-and-pasted from a web example. I think I knocked the whole thing off in one afternoon and spent the other 39.5 working days cloistered in my \"programming lab\" watching YouTube fail videos and playing Enemy Territory against other similarly hard-working administrators. \n\"Yes, good idea,\" I reply. \"although it'd probably help if he gets some experience with userbility.\" \n\"Oh, I'm majoring in Usability,\" James gasps. \"My thesis topic will be on page layout for intuitive user input in forms-based..\" \n\"I didn't say usability, I said usERbility.\" \n\"I?\" \n\"It's a conjunction of the words user and ability. So we're not looking at what users WILL do but rather what they're CAPABLE of doing.\" \n\"I don't see the distinction.\" \n\"Ok, well this code is a perfect example of usability vs userbility. The code is triggered by someone from security from their desktop machine.\" \n\"So the application, what does it do?\" James asks \n\"It takes information from the HR database about staff, including name, employment status, department, department access groups, special access groups, hours of work, etc, and then propagates the information to Active Directory and the Security system.\" \n\"Really - and that takes 53,000 lines of code?\" he asks doubtfully. \n\"Oh, I remember back to the days when I never thought about testing for error conditions, verifying cascading authorisation trees and propagating audit trails,\" I sigh. \nThe code does none of that - so I need to get James' focus on another area for the time being. \n\"So anyway,\" I continue. \"I'd like to get you to have a bit of hands-on with the security system users so you see the issues that we have.\" \n\"Sure, where is the code, on the server somewhere?\" \n\"Don't be ridiculous, this is security code. No, it's quarantined from general access. I'll send you the code once I've dug it out of the time lock.\" \n\"Time Lock?\" \n\"Yeah, you can only check code out of the version control system after 48 hours notice - It's a security thing,\" I respond. \nHonestly I don't know where I come up with this rubbish. In fact if we'd had a lie detector with a beep function he probably wouldn't have heard anything I said in that last sentence - if it hadn't already imploded during that blather about special access groups, etc. \nSo I'm going to have to keep James busy for a couple of weeks. \nTwo days of \"meeting the users and scoping the requirements\" later he's in Mission Control itching to get his hands on the code - and not just because if you showed your average security user a pie chart he'd try to eat it. \n\"Oh! You wanted that NOW! You should have said - I didn't actually initiate the pull request!\" I gasp. \n\"So what does that mean?\" he asks. \n\"Well, I need to initiate the pull request to get the code out of the system in 48 hours.\" \n\"I see.\" he says, a blend of disappointment and mild annoyance. \n... \n\"So you WANTED me to initiate the request?\" I ask when he returns two days later. \"You should have said!\" \n\"YES!\" he says, no blending this time. \"I don't have much longer to review the code!\" \n... \n\"Oh! I forgot.\" I say, two days later. \"I got a bit side-tracked when you started banging on about reviewing the code.\" \n\"So. We. Can. Do. It. Now?\" He says, measuring his words very carefully. \n\"Absolutely. I'll just fire up the VC client, connect to the server and....\" \n\"Server's down for maintenance,\" the PFY says. \"Shouldn't be too long.\" \n... \n\"Sorry, forgot again. Got tied up in that server reboot. But wait a sec, >clickety< , it's all queued up now!\" \n\"Right,\" James sighs, looking slightly broken. \n... \n\"Would you believe it - I didn't realise the pull request would be delivered on a Saturday. And now the pull window's closed. It only stays open for 8 hours.\" \n\"A security thing?\" James asks - slightly sarcastically if I'm not mistaken. \n... \n\"Okay, so did you bring a 5 1\/4 inch floppy?\" I ask, when he rolls in the next time \n\"WHAT!?\" he seethes \n\"A 5 1\/4 inch floppy. It's another security thing.

There's no code is there?\" James asks brokenly. \n\"What?\" I gasp. \"You think I'd make up a story about 57 thousand lines of code?\" \n\"53,000\" James says \n\"Oh, I wrote a backwards compatibility module to allow seamless upgrades while you were away getting that floppy,\" I lie. \n\"But there isn't... any code... is there?\" he sighs. \"You may as well tell me - I'm leaving tomorrow.\" \n\"There IS code\" I admit. \"Possibly a couple of orders of magnitude less than was originally reported.\" \n\"What does it do?\" he asks. \n\"Just imports their names and departments, flushes a differential file to the security server for adds and changes, then opens an application window on the security user's screen.\" \n\"Why does it open the application window if it's already done the work?\" \n\"So someone from security can click on the import button and the real work gets done.\" \n\"The real work?\" \n\"The code that makes the button go green, waits 15-20 seconds and then pops up a message window saying 'Import Succeeded'.\" \n\"A security thing?\" he sighs. \n\"Oh no, that's a userbility thing...\" \n"}

Sure, they mention figures, but when you come to get money to expand the backup RAID array the cupboard is bare. THEN, when several people lose files which are unrecoverable because the RAID array was too small, there's TONS of money.\" \n\"Yes, but successful budgeting gives the company confidence to...\" \n\"... spend more money on high-end executive laptops with luxurious leather satchels, yes. So they give you 50k for, say, for new servers. If you spend 40k then the beancounters will tell you that you must only need 40k next year. If you spend the 50k you budgeted they'll take 5k off next year's budget for cost cutting and if you spend 60k they'll take 10k of next year's 50k to make up the shortfall.\" \n\"So what do you do? Estimate higher?\" \n\"No, you spend 60k. And 70k the next year and 75k the year after that – just to teach them a lesson.\" \n\"OK,\" the PFY says. \"Management ideas. Your average middle manager is going to have maybe two good ideas in his working lifetime, one of which will be having a dump before going to a long meeting. More often than not his only ACTUAL good idea happened years ago and he's still living on the glory of buying second-hand POTS phones at auction and making a killing on falsified depreciation. He'll continue to bring it up for the rest of his life – even when people don't know what POTS phones are.\" \n\"Yes, but what has this got to do with the security code?\" \n\"The rest of the time his ideas are like a turd in a desk drawer. The nearer you get to it the more it smells – until you see it in all its glory. Then... the horror.\" \n\"Yeah, but the security system...\" \n\"Management Ideas – Part 2. Whenever a middle manager comes to you and says 'I've been thinking' or 'You know what would be a good idea?' you can be 98 per cent certain they have not been thinking and that it's a crap idea. BUT YOU NEVER SAY NO.\" \n\"Sorry? I thought you said it was a bad idea.\" \n\"Yes, but you don't say no. What you say is 'Hmmm, yes. Yes, you know what; I'll have a think about that.'\" \n\"And you immediately erase it from your brain,\" the PFY says. \n\"Easier said than done.\" James jokes. \n\"Not if you're a seven-pinter.\" \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"Seven pints,\" the PFY says. \"The amount of strong lager it takes to erase things from your brain.\" \n\"And incidentally,\" I add, \"the same amount of strong lager it takes to make a turd in the Boss's drawer sound like a great idea.\" \n\"Another thing you can do to head off a 'good idea' is to invent a crisis to divert the Boss's attention.\" \n\"A crisis?\" \n\"Yeah, a fire, a server crash, pushing him out the window...\" \n\"Out the window!\" \n\"Yeah, it's only two floors, and odds are there's some scaffolding pipe laying on the footpath to break his fall.\" \n\"B-b-but that security change IS a good idea.\" \n\"No it's not,\" I say. \"It's the most common management idea ever – a solution to a problem we don't have.\" \n\"And the most common STPWDHs are: performance\/uptime\/service delivery monitoring – because the users do that for us, remote access to services from some oddball home device – because it'll last two years and be obsolete, or – as in this case – an enhancement which no one will ever use.\" \n\"But you don't even know what the security enhancement is,\" James counters. \n\"You mean the one to use the access records to verify the hours people are in the building?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"As a 'fire safety initiative designed to ensure everyone is out of the building in the event of a fire'?\" \n\"Yes!\" James says. \n\"And not to provide evidence that the PFY and myself often take 2.5-hour, seven-pint lunches prior to one of us letting ourselves into the Boss's office while he's at a meeting?\" \n\"Uh... I don't know anything about that.\" \n\"It doesn't matter. The Boss came in with that particular 'You know I've been thinking' idea several weeks ago, then he got you after we spent several more weeks 'thinking about it' over lunch...\" \n\"So I'm never seeing the code then?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"But TECHNICALLY it's not a bad idea.\" \n\"True, but it does fall into the category of 'enhancement that no one will use'.\" \n\"The Boss would use it.\" \n\"Not after he falls out of a window later today he won't...\" \n"}

You're thinking this is a blue pill\/red pill scenario when in reality we stuffed the red pill into your mouth and held your nose weeks ago. \nThis the real world – a world where IT Managers are often dumber than the cleaners, the cleaners far smarter than the users and processor speed being almost entirely irrelevant.... \n\"It's a world where you get paid to make up new words for the same old crap simply by changing the access method of one of the layers, where literally anyone can be a visionary and the beauty and elegance of bespoke craftsperson code is undermined by a user who demands a flashing font so that other users will know that the box marked 'warning' is important.\" \nJames is conflicted. We can tell he's contemplating the options in front of him and whether a blue antidote pill might exist in some parallel universe. It's the deciding moment and the PFY cannot interfere, any more than I interfered when then PFY was faced with this same decision many years ago – or my mentor interfered when it was my decision several years before that. \nThe tense silence is broken only by the quietest of shrieks outside the window, a distant thud and the beginnings of a car alarm, which only goes to illustrate how dangerous fitting a spring mechanism to the full-height window in the meeting room above us can be. \nThere has been a tragic workplace accident involving our beloved Director. \nJames has made his decision with no external influence – the same way the PFY did when I asked him to help me load that unusually heavy roll of carpeting into a van all those years ago – the same way I did several years before that when the same van, piloted by my mentor mounted the pavement during an otherwise routine kebab run. \nHe now knows what we know. \nHe's taken the red pill... \n"}

Unhappy with the new website rebranding exercise, he's been making vague comments about his dissatisfaction around the office in the hopes of stirring the masses into an uprising. \nHaving put down many such uprisings in the past, the PFY and I just look on. \n\"This is going to be a bunfight,\" the PFY muses. \n\"Yes - It's important because the stakes are so small,\" I concur. \nDon't get me wrong, I love committees - they're a great way of getting the troublemakers all in one place. A small office with a lockable door and inadequate fresh air supply for instance - or even just up against a heavily pockmarked wall... \nThe only minus with committees is their ad hoc approach to measurable criteria.

But only by the teeniest amount.\" \n\"Well it's affecting my pictures.\" \n\"Okay, what's the workstation ID on the front of your machine?\" \n\"W-K-2-F-3-1.\" \n\"Is that 2-F or 2-S?\" I ask staring at the ceiling. \n\"2-F, for Freddy.\" \n\"Okay, just give me a minute,\" I say, swinging my chair around to look at the Boss. \"I'm just going to back out the change for your machine.\" \n\"When will you...\" \n\"Working on it now,\" I say, waving my hands in an abracadabra manner for the Boss. \"Okay, can you close the pictures and re-open them?\" \n\"I'll just... and then... YES! Yes, they're back to normal.\" \n\"Okay, I'll just make a note of that,\" I say. \"Bye now.\" \n\"Well that means nothing!\" the Boss says. \"That could just be..\" \n>ring< \n\"I'm just ringing to see if you can turn off that monitor thing?\" the next hands-freer asks. \n\"Why's that?\" I ask. \n\"The pattern is upsetting my eyes.\" \n\"We didn't change the pattern - we just changed one of the colours infinitesimally.\" \n\"Yes, well whatever you did is giving me a headache.\" \n\"Oh, I see. What was the workstation ID from your machine?\" \n\"W-K-3-R-0-7.\" \n\"Was that W-K or W-J?.\" \n\"W-K.\" \n\"Oh, right, just a minute I'll recalibrate the monitor to the normal settings,\" I say, rolling my eyes at the Boss. \n\"OK, I've reversed it, but it's an adjustment to the colour temperature so it'll take about five minutes to cool down and 10 minutes to fully stabilise. Turn your monitor off for at least 10 seconds now so the changes are applied.\" \n\"Oh, OK, thanks.\" \n\"No problem.\" \n... \n\"So what did you actually change?\" the Boss asks, after three more calls. \n\"Nothing.\" \n\"I mean originally?\" he says. \n\"Nothing. I changed nothing. I just sent an email out saying I changed something.\" \n\"So these problems were already there and your email has just prompted people to recognise them.\" \n\"There are no problems, only users.\" \n\"Yes but MAYBE there always WAS a problem but people are only realising it now.\" \n\"There's no problem,\" the PFY echoes. \n\"So why are people ringing?\" \n\"Because they're idiots,\" I say. \"And the worst is yet to come.\" \n\"How? Why?\" \n\"It's almost lunchtime. By the time people have mingled at the cafe and shared their colour change and headache stories there will be a groundswell of unhappy people. Some will go home sick - one may never fully recover. Someone will probably put a piece of polarised glass from a pound shop over their monitor and 10 others will follow suit for a few months until...\" \n\"I...\" \n\"Some will tilt their screens slightly to compensate for the extra glare,\" the PFY adds, \"while others will need to upgrade their monitor because their current one has been permanently damaged by the change.\" \n\"And we will get calls,\" the PFY says, \"many, many calls. The helpdesk will be inundated - in about 35 minutes.\" \n\"So email them and tell them it was a hoax!\" the Boss says. \n\"They won't believe that - they'll think it's a cover-up because of the tumours that the chromatic thing has caused.\" \n\"WHAT BLOODY TUMOURS!?\" \n\"There must be tumours, because we're trying to cover it up. Do you want me to send the email cover-up message now?\" \n\"Uh, no. Why not email them and say you've rolled back the change?\" \n\"No, that won't work - people will just think you're lying and the calls will continue.\" \n\"Well what do you suggest?\" \n\"Simple, we need to train the helpdesk on what to do.\" \n\"Which is?\" \nFirst thing - you need to get their workstation ID - and then ask them to repeat part of it so it seems like you're looking it up. Next thing, there needs to be a pause for us to 'roll back the change' followed by some user interaction - they have to DO something which 'makes the change take effect'. \n\"Switch something on or off, reboot, close an application, change the monitor resolution a couple of times - it doesn't really matter what. Then they feel like something has been done - because we wouldn't get them to do something if we'd done nothing.\" \n\"Do you really think people won't see through this?\" \n\"People see what they want to see. We've not even heard from the people with monitor-triggered Seasonal Affective Disorder yet - that's a couple of weeks away.\" \n\"You did all that with an email,\" the Boss sighs. \"I can't imagine what happens when you mean a real change.\" \n\"Oh we make them all the time,\" the PFY replies. \"We just don't tell anyone.\" \n"}

Strap me to your Hell Desk, PFY","Link":"\/2017\/07\/28\/bofh_2017_episode_10\/","Content":"Episode 10 \"So what do you think?\" the Boss asks. \"You've had more experience than me at this.\" \n\"Hypochondria?\" I say \"Yes, I suppose you're right.\" \n\"There's nothing hypochondriac about repetitive strain injuries!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"You mean OOS,\" the PFY counters. \"And of course there is. Have you ever noticed how over-represented serial whiners are in the workplace illness stats?\" \n\"Well we can't afford to ignore it,\" the Boss chips back. \n\"We can't afford to indulge it!\" I counter. \"And WHY is it an IT expense?\" \n\"It's an IT expense because it comes from using a computer. And the computer rests on a desk designed for a computer.\" \n\"Let me tell you about MY experience of 'designed for a computer'.\" I seethe. Back in the day we used a standard issue flat desk with a three drawer module down the side. Wooden top, one size fits all, with a variable number of Yellow Pages for monitor height adjustment. \nThen we had the big RSI scare so all that furniture went in the skip and we changed to something similar with adjusting wheels and clips to change the table and monitor height. Hugely expensive. \n\"Then we got rid of those because of Feng shui or something and got those light weight desks on wheels which did exactly the same thing but were of much poorer construction and which would bow in the middle under the weight of a 20\" CRT. Then we got rid of them because they didn't have an adjustment for keyboard height separate from desk height. \n\"Then we got rid of them because the movable keyboard platform wasn't big enough for a mouse and wasn't deep enough for a keyboard wrist pad. NOW, we have a desk which is remarkably like the office desk of old, except that the three drawer unit is on wheels.\" \n\"Yes, but research shows tha...\" \n\"Research shows whatever the furniture vendor wants to pay for research on. So a standing up desk may or may not be conducive to health - but we've already seen that people tend to use the adjustable desks for about a month before fixing them in a single position and never adjusting them again. You could achieve more for back pain reduction by telling the custard guts in stores to stop eating a deep fried chicken for breakfast!\" \n\"People don't use adjustable desks because they're so hard to adjust!\" the Boss blurts \"Which is why we want to look at the electrically adjustable work desks. They have settings!\" \nSigh. \n\"You know I've been working on an adjustable desk at home.\" the PFY proffers. \nWhich is news to me. \n\"You mean working on designing one, or working on a desk that is adjustable?\" \n\"Both,\" the PFY says. I based my design around old battery drill motors and threaded rod along with a few heavy duty servos I pulled out of an old printer. It has a USB interface to my desktop and can adjust the table, monitor and keyboard height, along with table, monitor and keyboard tilt. I run a schedule on my desktop which continuously adjusts the height and tilt over the course of a day. \n\"I even have a wireless battery-powered chair so that the chair is linked to the height of the table. See, one of the issues with standing or sitting desks is the threat of blood clot from inactivity, but by micro-adjusting the heights over the course of a day someone can be sitting and yet get full leg extension and lumbar vertebrae movement.\" \n\"Wouldn't you get seasick?\" the Boss asks. \n\"We're talking millimetres a minute - you'd be hard pressed to notice the micro adjustments. But by continuously adjusting height and angle you avoid 'stagnation illnesses'.\" \n\"And you've been doing this in your own time?\" \n\"Of course!\" the PFY says. \"If I did it during work time the company would want a slice of my intellectual property once I start marketing them.\" \n\"You're going to market them?\" \n\"ABSOLUTELY! The market for an infinitely adjustable workstation which can be tailored to the logged-in user is huge!\" \n\"So you can remember each user's settings?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It can and does. So a 6-footer logs in and it sets the workstation environment to that person's tailored settings. When they logout the workstation and chair slips back to the default settings. The first time someone uses the desk we set up the initial heights as well as the micro-adjustment speeds and limits. Changing them is as simple as opening a desktop app.\" \nIt could be my imagination but the PFY's nose appears to be taking on quite the brown tinge... \n\"And we could try it here?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No.\" the PFY responds. \"Like I said, intellectual property, and all that.\" \n\"But surely you need guinea pigs?\" \n\"Ahhh, no.\" \n\"But it would be a perfect place to test the unit - we have so many different types of people here.\" \n\"And a perfect place for someone to see my technology and duplicate it.\" the PFY counters. \n\"We could do a non-disclosure thingy.\" \n\"And just use my technology free of charge?!\" the PFY asks. \n\"Well I'm sure we could come to some small financial agreement.\" \n\"It would need to be better than small.\" \nHalf an hour later and some legalese from the company's legal consultant and the PFY has agreed to trial his unit. Apparently there's a groundswell of lazy people out there who are lining up to trial adjustable work desks and the Boss is very keen to be the man to bring this technology to the masses. As such, he wants to be the poster-boy of the e-desk revolution. The PFY, meantime, wastes no time in ingratiating himself into the Boss's good books with a personal setup session... \n\"How's it going, Benedict?\" I ask when the PFY returns. \n\"Fantastic!\" the PFY says. \"The Boss is so chuffed with my design he's going to give me an initial order of 10 units to be installed around the building!\" \n>Ring!< \n\"Hello?\" I ask, noting the Boss' extension number on the caller ID. \n\"Mmmm mmmmmfff mm mmm mmm,\" he says. \n\"What?\" \n\"MMMMM! Mmmmfffffff!\" \n\"What's that?\" I ask. \"You're trapped in your desk?\" \n\"MMM!!!\" \n\"What did you say? You were tidying your keyboard and mouse cables when the keyboard raised itself and trapped your hands?\" I ask. \nThe PFY is starting to look a bit concerned... \n\"RRRRMMMMMMMM!!!\" \n\"And you had to dial this number with your nose?\" I ask. \n\"MMMRMMMMRRRREEERRR!\" \n\"And then the monitor level lowered and trapped your head?!\" I ask. \n\"RRRRRRRRMMMMMMmmmm!!\" \n\"AND THEN THE MONITOR TILT KICKED IN AND DROPPED THE 25 INCH CRT - WHICH THE PFY PUT ONTO THE LEDGE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT COULD HANDLE - ONTO YOUR HEAD?\" \n\"MM?\" \n\"Oh, that hasn't happened yet,\" I say. \n>clicky< \n>CRUNCH< \n\"Oh, he's rung off,\" I say to the PFY. \"Nice USB interface, that. So easy to work from a remote desktop session. Not looking good for those desk orders. Hope you didn't order a bunch of materials or anything.\" \n... \nThis probably means war. \n"}

The thinking is that we'll have a series of whole-of-company meetings to brainstorm each of the areas - branding, logo, mission statement and website.\" \n\"Of course there will,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"Which is where you come in,\" he adds. \n\"Oh, I'd love to - but I'm vacuuming the server room floor that day,\" I say. \n\"And I'm vacuuming the server room sub floor,\" the PFY chips in... \n\"We need video conferencing. To the desktop,\" he blurts, ignoring us. \n\"Which desktop?\" \n\"All the desktops.\" \n\"All the desktops?!\" \n\"Yes, all the desktops in the company.

Is there a time constraint on this? Though of course the network won't handle it - and even if it did I don't know of a videoconference service that could handle the simultaneous connections - unless we implement multicast - and even if it did I think your multi-conference would just be endless audio interruptions of numbers phones ringing, fart noises and people saying 'can you hear me?'\" \n\"Okay - maybe we could gather people into meeting rooms?\" \n\"There's 30 meeting rooms nationwide, about 15 in this building and the rest at distal sites.

You know, who's riding that pony off the cliff?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"DON'T TELL ME! It's one of the Boss' school pals who's read 'Corporate Branding for Complete Tossers' three times and now considers themselves an expert.\" \n\"I don't really know...\" \n\"It's OK, there's nothing I like more than PAYING someone to PARAPHRASE WHAT I JUST TOLD THEM and produce a 20-page document that is worth less than it's weight in bog paper - which, incidentally, is all the document will be good for.\" \n\"I think perhaps once you get to know him you'll...\" \n...Two Days Later... \n\"So I'm just here to tease out the important threads,\" the \"Expert\" tells the PFY and me. \"Brand Promise and Value, Recognisability and Position and finally the Company Story. Once we have that, we feed that into the design process to come up with a logo, banner, stationery elements and then at the very end we have the website restructure and rebranding.\" \n\"...\" \n\"And so any feedback or thoughts you have at this point would aid that process.\" \n\"...\" \n\"So do you have any input?\" \n\"Uhhmm, no,\" I say. \n\"None at all?\" \n\"Nope,\" the PFY echoes. \n\"What about your thoughts on where the company is, where it's going?\" \n\"I'm only here because they said there would be biscuits,\" the PFY says. \n\"Chocolate biscuits,\" I add. \n\"Well yes, I have supplied some morning tea,\" he says, pushing a plate forward, \"but I had hoped...\" \n\"TECHNICALLY, you're claiming the food supplies as an expense - against our operational budget - so really WE'RE providing the morning tea.\" \nOur expert pauses mid-chocolate-grasp as the PFY has a huge coughing fit. Deep, chunky coughs, all over the biscuits. \n\"Sorry about that,\" the PFY says. \"Please continue.\" \n\"So I'm just wanting your input,\" he says, withdrawing his hand from the potential contamination zone. \n\"I... don't think we have any - well apart from the Pantome colours we use.\" \n\"You mean Pantone I think?\" he says smugly. \n\"Uh, no, Pantome. It superseded Pantone - you know, because it wasn't metric.\" \n\"Of of course!\" our expert nods knowingly while jotting down the word Pantome to look up later. \n...While the PFY registers the domain name and creates plausible website content from his phone... \n\"But you have no other suggestions?\" \n\"None.\" \n\"So you don't want to be part of this process?\" \n\"To be honest, now that the biscuits are off the table this process is about as exciting to me as watching water dry,\" I say. \n\"And you've got me looking for a structurally rated ceiling member, a length of stout cord and a wobbly chair,\" the PFY responds. \n\"I hardly think it's that bleak for you,\" he counters. \n\"Oh it's not for me,\" the PFY snaps back. \n\"And I'd rather cross a 100 foot linoleum tile tightrope - between two skyscrapers - ON A WHEELY CHAIR than be involved in this process.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"No, actually I'd rather it was you on the wheely chair. If I'm honest.\" \n\"WELL, I THINK WE'VE PRETTY MUCH COVERED EVERYTHING,\" he says nervously. \n\"No, don't go, there's something over by the window I'd like to show you. Just slide on over.\" \n... \n\"That's the problem with experts - no sense of humour,\" the PFY says later. \n\"True, still at least we have that Company Story organised - 'And they all lived happily ever after'.\" \n\"..except for that bloke on the footpath in that pile of linoleum being loaded into an ambulance...\" The PFY adds. \nUnnecessarily. \n"}

We read the resumes, attended the interviews; we asked some questions!\" \n\"I'm referring to your comments on the candidates.\" \n\"Which ones?\" I ask. \n\"All of them!\" \nIt's appointments time again and we're looking for a new Boss after the last one raced out his full height second floor window on a wheely chair. Why he did that is anyone's guess, as is how the PFY's footprint happened to be on the back of the aforementioned chair. \nSome things you just can't explain. \nIn any case it seems you can get PTSD from a violent pneumatic ram insertion and the former Boss has retired early on medical grounds. \nThe Director, meantime, has read some HR blog that says it's good to get the input of the direct reports when recruiting new middle management and included the PFY and myself in the appointments process. \n\"All of them?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"What was wrong?\" I ask. \n\"This one,\" the Director responds, pointing at a note in the margin of a resume. \"You wrote: 'Can't even spell IT' .\" \n\"That's not a criticism,\" the PFY says. \"That's just identifying him as perfect pie-eating IT management material.\" \n\"And what makes you think that?\" \n\"You asked him about service levels and he thought you were talking about Restaurants,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"Well what about this? 'A blend of fast-acting stupidity and sustained release incompetence' ?\" \n\"He was an air thief,\" I reply sadly. \"I've seen brighter lights in a fridge.\" \n\"Well now we have an issue where there are apparently no suitable candidates,\" the Director snaps back at us. \n\"From that pool, anyway. Honestly, we could make a robot to do that job.\" \n\"In what way?\" he asks. \n\"50 per cent of the the former occupant's role was sending email to remind people of things to be done and then filing their emailed replies. If we could program a robot to wander around the office scratching its arse and eating lard sandwiches as well then we'd have the whole position cracked.\" \n\"Could you do that?\" the Director gasps, thinking keenly of future accolades as the implementer of inexpensive robotic management. \n\"What, the arse scratching and sandwich eating?\" \n\"No, could you make a robotic manager who would track workflows?\" \n\"You wouldn't need a robot to do that - it could all be done on a server,\" the PFY says. \"There are several off-the-shelf products that do that already.\" \n\"Yes, but we'd want to keep the office space allocation for the role, so a robot would look better on the books. Maybe you could get it to use Siri to get verbal updates in person when it visited people.\" \n\"We've had some... teething issues with robots in the past,\" I admit. \"I'm not sure people would welcome one into their offices - especially those with full height windows.\" \n\"Yes, so I've heard - but this wouldn't need to be that... aggressive. It just has to be something with a 'presence', the ability to note stuff down, and maybe talk and listen. It doesn't even need to be that intelligent.\" \n\"Yes, I think that describes the former Boss quite well - except for the bits about noting stuff down and listening ...\" I say. \n\"And presence,\" the PFY adds. \n\"So could you do it?\" \n\"We have a couple of broken units in the basement. We could de-weaponise them, reduce their speed to a slow trundle and maybe add a smiley face?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Yes – and if it could just be programmed to get verbal updates about projects and give verbal reminders?\" \n\"Yeah sure.\" \n\"And maybe it could understand plain English and the project management could also include verifying and tracking project costs?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"What about if it could deliver the mail? AND it could have a camera and recognise people and deliver mail and project updates when it encounters them in the building?\" \n\"And perhaps it could give lectures about scope creep while it was at it?\" \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"Nothing. We'll see what we can do.\" \n... \n\"So?\" The Director says a couple of days later. \"What are you waiting for? Switch it on!\" \n\"We thought you'd like to do that,\" the PFY says. \n\"I...\" the Director says, thinking of the number of ways we could disguise an axe, chainsaw or a flame-thrower in a tin box. \"What's that thing on the front?\" \n\"It's a tray. To carry mail - and biscuits, until people get comfortable with it.\" \n\"Oh, I see. Good Idea. >CLICK<\" \n>Whirr< \n\"Good morning,\" the Robot says. \"Good Morning David. Good Morning Simon.

Did someone get lost on the Audit Trail?","Link":"\/2017\/10\/13\/bofh_2017_episode_13\/","Content":"Episode 13 So I'm walking down the corridor from Mission Control with about a ream of financial paperwork when I notice the Boss coming the other way with the IT Director in tow - never a good sign. \nI quickly slip down a side corridor towards the lifts but not so quickly that the Boss doesn't see me going. I get to the lifts just as the doors open and take a moment to look around furtively before jumping in and pressing a button. \n\"Where are you going?\" the Boss blurts from a distance, eyeing the potentially important documents that I have on my person. \n\"Ah, just to the basement,\" I lie, pressing the button for one floor up. \n\"What for?\" he wheezes as the doors close. \n\"Oh, ahhhhmm, just going to see if all the computer ports down there are still working at full duplex,\" I blather, as the lift heads UP. \nI stroll out of the lift at a leisurely pace, knowing full well that the Boss is on my tail but also knowing that he won't get to me before... \n\"Wait,\" he gasps, stepping out of the other lift just as I step into the shredder room. \nIt's times like this that the full value of mindless executive paranoia is fully realised. Having heard that someone, somewhere, somehow had managed to piece together shredded paper, the powers that be purchased a two-pass shredder that chops as well as shreds, converting documents into confetti in a matter of moments. \n\"What're you doing?!\" the Boss calls down the corridor as whatever-it-is inside the shredder slowly spins up to its million RPM operating speed. The fear at what would happen if this thing - having lain disused in a damp basement for several years before being moved to this room - threw a bearing is offset by my technical keenness to see exactly what it's capable of. \nI grab a few sheets of paper and stuff them into the danger-sticker emblazoned inlet slot. An unseen force TARDISes the pages away to another galaxy under the machine a tiny pile of unevenly diced paper appears on the floor. That alone would be unimpressive, were it not eclipsed by the tombstone-heavy >WHISKSKS< and >TOK< >TOK< >TOK< >TOK< noises which seem to echo through the building, indicating that this thing could probably reduce a 1980s Yellow Pages to confetti with the same amount of ease - along with the phone booth it was chained to and the phone pole that serviced it. \n\"Uh... What are you shredding?\" the Boss asks, arriving in the doorway. \n\"Ah, just some old papers - nothing important,\" I lie, dropping the whole pile into the inlet tray. \nAbout two seconds later, the confetti pile has grown dramatically and the unit is spinning slowly down. \n\"This wouldn't have anything to do with the financial audit would it?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The financial audit; what's that then?\" I lie, in a very unconvincing manner. \n\"You know very well what it is. The new company auditors have discovered some anomalies in the verification of expenses claims over the past several years. They believe that someone's being submitting duplicate documents.\" \n\"Really?\" I say. \"And so, what, you're looking for some help with this?\" \n\"No, I'm after your expense form duplicates.\" \n\"My expense form duplicates?\" \n\"Yes, yours and your assistant's.\" \n\"Hmm, I'd probably have to look in my filing cabinet for that,\" I say. \"- because I keep them all in hard copy.\" \n\"So this wouldn't be them there then?\" the Boss asks pointing at the confetti. \n\"Those, no, this is just preventative maintenance. One of our tasks is to just run this up with a bit of a load on it just to see how it performs.\" \n\"Really? When did you check it last ?\" \n\"Hmmm, hard to be sure but maybe 2008, before it was put into storage.\" \n\"So you wouldn't mind if I collected this?\" he says. \n\"That?\" I say. \"Go for your life. Anyway, love to stay and chat but I need to go visit finance on 4th. Printer problem.\" \n\"Really? Mind if I tag along?\" \n\"Sure, if you like.\" \nThe Boss carefully scoops the confetti into a bag which he takes great pains in sealing, signing and dating. \n\"Just here about the printer issue,\" I say, when we arrive on 4th. \n\"What printer issue?\" one of the beancounters asks. \"Apparently there's some colour issue on one of the printers,\" I say, an excuse which is guaranteed to appeal to any pedant within hearing range. \n\"Over there,\" one of the Beancounters calls out. \"That one is all over the place.\" \nThe Boss traipses over with me as I open the machine up, shake the toner cartridges, run a couple of test prints, replace the cyan cartridge, run some more test prints and eventually give up. \n\"Probably best get an engineer in,\" I say, noticing that the Boss is taking great pains to ensure that he's between me and the window into the Beancounter's meeting room. \n\"Well if that's all,\" I say to him, \"I might just pop up to HR - got to check on their wireless access point.\" \n\"You know, I actually have to go to H.R myself,\" the Boss says. \"I might just ride up with you.\" \n\"Sure, it's only a floor, so I'll be taking the stairs.\" \n\"No problem,\" he says feigning enthusiasm. \nWe get to HR and I go through the motions of checking the wireless access point, unplugging it, plugging it back in. The Boss, meantime, is having a sneaky chat with the head of HR and pretending not to look my way. \n\"All good,\" I say about 15 minutes later. \"I'll be off.\" \n\"I'll ride down with you!\" the Boss says, quickly ending his conversation and heading my way. \n\"So, maybe things haven't gone the way you planned today?\" the Boss says smugly, patting his plastic bag. \n\"In what way?\" I ask. \n\"Didn't realise you'd have company?\" \n\"Oh no, company's great in my role,\" I say, pressing the Emergency stop button on the lift. \n\"In your role?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Yes. I'm the decoy,\" I say, as the sound of a heavily loaded shredder start echoing through the building. \n"}

No decisions have been made yet.\" \n\"Whenever someone has to point out that 'No decisions have been made yet', it pretty much means that those decisions HAVE been made,\" I note. \n\"No, this is just a review process,\" he assures me. \"We’re just looking at how to restructure the department.\" \n\"So job cuts then?\" the PFY says, entering Mission Control and only hearing half the story. \n\"No, we’re simply looking at a physical restructure of the department.\" The Director says. \"Nothing is set in stone.\" \n\"Ah, so you’ve already decided then?\" the PFY asks. \n\"You’ll be given a chance to give your input,\" he snaps. \n\"Ah yes, the old locked filing cabinet in the disused basement toilet, marked 'Beware of the Leopard'? trick,\" the PFY shoots back. \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"He means that we fully expect that our comments will be filed in the appropriate box – one which is just slightly larger than a desktop shredder and which has a power lead coming out of it.\" \n\"You’ll get the chance to have your say!\" he snaps. \n\"I can say no now if you like.\" \n\"Look, it’s plain to see that you don’t need all this space – what with computers getting smaller and the cloud and stuff like that.\" \n\"Yes, but this is a 1970s building, originally constructed by the government when they were trying to prop up the steel and cement industries single-handedly – and this area was supposed to be the core recovery zone for the building.\" \n\"I don’t see how that’s relevant.\" \n\"The floor below us is TWO AND A HALF FEET of steel-reinforced concrete. The one above us is TWO feet thick. This area of the building was required to be standing at the end of the apocalypse, and the server room was designed to be right where it is now – you can still see the bracing rails for the original PDP-11s under the raised floor.\" \n\"So?\" \n\"So the company that bought the building before us ALSO put their server room in this location, as we did after them. It’s the only logical place.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"It’s the only place with access to the risers; everywhere else in the building is blocked off by masses of concrete structure. The only real ducts in the building lead from this space; everything else is sloppy catenary wires and poorly drilled holes.\" \n\"You could put everything in the basement. That has access to the risers.\" \n\"And the moment a fire main has an issue the basement fills with water it's game over, Player One,\" the PFY says. \n\"Could that ever really happen?\" \n\"I could pretty much guarantee it,\" I say pointedly. \n\"Possibly even the week we’d moved there,\" the PFY says, nodding knowingly. \n\"Possibly even before we started the moving process,\" I add. \n\"Maybe even this afternoon,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"OK, so maybe the basement isn’t a good idea,\" The Director says hastily. But surely you don’t need all this room. We could carve off half this office without a problem. \n\"I told you - this whole space was constructed as a standalone environment,\" I explain\/lie. \n\"The server, comms and control rooms are completely detached 'fire separate' fire cell. Even the water that feeds our coffee machine is separate from the building supply. This is the one area meant to stay running, which is why we – and every occupant before us - put the entire critical infrastructure here. Every element of comms, building management, IT, security, climate control and all emergency systems come back to here. Every interlock, every emergency staging procedure – it all comes back here. You just can’t move it.\" \n\"Well I think it's a waste of space. We should be able to get some of it back.\" \n\"You assume we want all this space,\" I say. \"Honestly, do you think we WANT to be on the second floor with sunlight and unobstructed views of the pub across the road? Do you think we LIKE the floor-to-ceiling pivoting windows which can be swung wide open in summer?\" \n\"Hang on,\" the Director counters. \"If this is a fire cell – as you claim – then where’s the separate fire exit? I know you need one because the architects said we’d have to include one if the exit path were too long.\" \n\"So nothing's been decided but you’ve been talking to an architect?\" I ask. \n\"In any case, the fire exit is there,\" the PFY says – pointing to an EXIT sign above the middle window. \n\"What, you’re expected to jump out the WINDOW?!\" \n\"It’s only the second floor!\" I retort. \"If you aim for the right parked car you’d probably walk away with a few bruises, maybe a minor fracture.\" \n\"Nothing old or Soviet Block,\" the PFY chips in helpfully. \"The metal's too thick.\" \n\"I think you're…\" \n>JANGLE!< \nThe Director’s impending rant is interrupted by a fire alarm. \n\"!\" he burbles wordlessly. \n\"No need to panic,\" I say. \n\"Shouldn’t we evacuate?\" the Director says, jiggling the handle to Mission Control to no avail. \n\"We can’t,\" the PFY says. \"Like we told you - it’s a completely separate fire cell. The moment the fire alarms go off the doors lock.\" \n\"THE DOORS LOCK?!\" \n\"Yeah – to stop the proles trying to get in – a bit like what those government nuclear bunkers have,\" the PFY says, swinging open the window of our fire exit. “They lock out the roof, the basement and the IT fire cell. Oh, and the storeroom on the 6th floor where they keep the boardroom booze.” \n\"But we can’t get out!\" he gasps. \n\"Of course we can. We can get out here,\" The PFY says gesturing out the window. \n\"I’m not jumping to the ground from here!\" he gasps. \n\"You’re not expected to jump to the ground,\" he says. \"You’ve only got to jump to the fire pole - yet another relic of the original building construction.\" \n\"Oh!\" he says with relief. \"I’d not noticed that.\" \nHe's also not noticed the 100lb fishing line tripwire stretched tautly about an inch above the floor just inside the window, but I don’t feel the need to point that out at this juncture. \n\"In any case, you don’t need to worry about that,” the PFY says, to my surprise. \" This was just a drill. >tappity< \n\"Oh,\" the Director says as the Mission Control door opens. \n\"So I assume you’ve evaluated our input into the proposed changes and seen some merit in it?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, yes, it’s certainly given me something to think about,\" he says, making for his office before we have another fire drill. \n… Later that day … \n\"Honestly, it’s like he doesn’t even listen to us,\" the PFY says, putting his headphones down on his desk. \n>tappity< >JANGLE< \n\"The bit about all Comms coming through here?\" I ask. \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"So he called the architect back, updated him and asked for a better plan?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"And he’s gone to the basement to get his car?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"And realised that you get locked in the basement during a fire alarm?\" \n\"Yep.\" \n\"And… he’s about to find out why we don’t put server rooms in the basement?\" \n\"Yep,\" the PFY says, as he turns the key on the basement deluge control… \n"}

A pair of our main virtual hosts has some interoperation hardware issue which is causing them to fail over to each other occasionally and almost immediately fail back again. The PFY and I have replaced about every single piece of the kit, but to no avail. In the end we gave up and just told the Boss we’d have to bring forward the scheduled replacement of the boxes by 4 months - which shouldn’t be a problem as there’s a healthy residual balance in the capital replacement budget. \nHe’s dead keen because one of his KPIs is uptime and he’s veering off into non-performance territory because of the laggy nature of the services during the failover events. \nThe minor problem is there’s no residual any more… \n“I don’t understand.” \n“So we forecast our budget in quarters and money is made available at the beginning of each quarter.” \n“Yes,” the Boss nods. \n“And if we have any residual in the capital or operational accounts, we explain the variance in a monthly report.” \n“Uh-huh.” \n“Now this is the tricky bit – IF we have residual in either account it’s carried over to the next quarter, UNLESS it’s in November.” \n“Why November?” \n“Because November is the month before the end of quarter but more importantly the month before the Christmas bonuses come out.” \n“I don’t see how that’s relevant.” \n“So if you’re the Director of a department and you want a Christmas bonus – for ‘achieving cost-reduction targets’ for instance – you will fillet any surplus from any accounts and offer it up to the Beancounters as a sacrifice to ensure your acceptability as a worthy bonus candidate. Only you have to show the savings BEFORE December otherwise your cost savings won’t be taken into account during the bonus discussions.” \n“I hardly think that’s likely t…” \n“LET’S JUST TAKE A PEEK AT THE FINANCIALS SYSTEM SHALL WE? >tappity< So here we go, our capital replacement budget; and there’s a journal entry of 25k to a Beancounter cost centre. And from our operational, another 25k. So an even 50k – just from systems and networks. So it’s gone, and we’ll never see it again. Unless...” \n“UNLESS?!” the Boss gasps, job on the line. \n“Unless there’s a compelling case to give the money back to us. Some critical project which can’t be kyboshed or delayed.” \n“There is – people are complaining about response time.” \n“No, that’s not compelling, that’s just annoying – and generally not annoying to the people who decide bonus amounts.” \n“So what is compelling?” the Boss asks, knowing that if he can’t find a way to stop these errors... \n“In the old days it was simple – something to do with the board members or something which directly impacts the financial well-being of the company in a way that cannot be sidestepped.” \n“AND NOW?” the Boss blurts. \n“Now the only thing left is Health and Safety.” \n“Health and Safety?” \n“Yes – to be considered compelling it needs to be something that someone could be seriously harmed by. Harmed badly enough that the company might be financially liable. Badly enough that one of the Board might be personally liable. BADLY ENOUGH THAT ANYONE WHO REJECTED A BUDGET REQUEST FOR A SAFETY FEATURE could be held liable.” \n“So we need to call our servers ‘Safety Servers’?” \n“No, it’s too generic and we already have safety servers. We need to respond to a clear and present threat. I present to you, our window.” \n“Your window?” \n“Yes, do you know how many of your predecessors have left the company – as it were – via this window?” \n“Uh – No,” he says nervously. \n“Good. In any case this is a clear and present danger. Something needs to be done.” \n“Can’t you just make it out of safety glass?” \n“It is safety glass, but it also pivots open.” \n“Can’t you lock it shut?” \n“We could – but then who’s to say that the lock might not work loose. How would we know – unless there was a comprehensive window safety monitoring server in place – one which monitored the state of all windows and raised an alarm with security.” \n“Don’t we just need to monitor THAT window?” he asks. “That’s hardly going to be worthy of a large server purchase... That’s the only window that we’ve had problems with.” \n“It is – but what if it wasn’t. What if someone were to fall from some other window? Now while we’ve been talking the PFY has been putting together a business case for this monitoring service which we believe you should present to the Director for approval.” \n“He’s not going to sign that.” \n“True – which is why we’re giving you this window key.” \n“WHAT? YOU’RE PROPOSING I PUSH HIM OUT THE WINDOW.” \n“Why not – it makes perfect sense. He falls out the window after refusing to sign off a budget to prevent people from falling out windows. I can GUARANTEE YOU (a) the irony will not be lost on anyone and (b) no one above him in the food chain will refuse to sign it off.” \n“So you’re really proposing this?” \n“It’s your choice,” I say, handing over the key. \nMeantime, the PFY and I get a pre-sales guy in to see what sort of servers we MIGHT buy, if the project gets off the ground. Or to the ground, if you’re the Director. \n… \n\"This one has hot swap memory,\" the pre-sales guy says, pointing at the motherboard \n\"Don't need it.\" \n\"It also has dual BIOS.\" \n\"Can't use it.\" \n\"Redundant power.\" \n\"Already have it.\" \n\"Lights out remote console monitoring.\" \n\"Don't want it.\" \n\"And it comes with these designer belts with a 128 gig USB3 stick built into the buckle.\" \n\"We'll take two,\" the PFY blurts. \n\"Ahem,\" I interject. \"Do the belts come in jet black and hide brown?\" \n\"Yes they do.\" \n\"Then we'll take four.\" \n“Make that six,” the Boss says, wiping his fingerprints off the window key before dropping it in my drawer. \nSo it’s a go! \n"}

It's just a device that Apple stole a naming convention from and which no one has used for many years.\" \n\"And why won't it be resolved?\" \n\"Because the user concerned wanted to hook it up to our network.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And before we could do it he fell out a window.\" \n\"So why's the job still open?\" \n\"Because the resolution text field is mandatory.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And if we put 'user fell out window' every time that happened we'd get database normalisation warnings from the helpdesk software.\" \n\"I... don't understand what you're talking about.\" \n\"It doesn't matter.\" \n\"So what about this printer issue?\" \n\"That's a data normalisation warning.\" \nNetwork too slow for video downloading? \n\"Data normalisation warning.\" \n\"And this one about admin access required?\" \n\"Oh that one. We gave him admin access, but sadly before he could use it there was a data normalisation warning - as an example to others. You'll note that it's the only outstanding admin access issue in the system, so we not only resolved the problem but also prevented a recurrence.\" \n\"I... What about...\" \n\"I know – you want to know about the job from this morning with no updates.

As A Service","Link":"\/2018\/01\/12\/bofh_2018_episode_1\/","Content":"Episode 1 The PFY is feeling a little unappreciated. APPARENTLY I’m not supporting him in his role very well and he feels a bit like a scapegoat. \nApparently. \nNot that he’s mentioned it but the Boss’s PA, Rita, has been giving me a rundown on office gossip that she picked up from the smoking gang who meet in the bus shelter across the road from the building. \nIn due course, whatever the Boss has been doing is over and she points me in the direction of his office. “Simon – you know David from accounts?” the Boss asks, pointing at a particularly gelatinous land mass with a tie that occupies a desk at Beancounter Central. “I don’t think so, no.” \n“Listen, I’ve called you in today because David has a complaint about the way he’s been treated.” \n“Really? I don’t believe I’ve even MET David, so I fail to see…” \n“Not you – your assistant!” David snaps. \n“The PFY?” I ask. \n“Yes” the Boss says. “Apparently he said a very unkind thing about David.” \n“What?” I ask. “Did he say he looked like he was poured into his clothes and forgot to say when?” \n“No.” \n“Did he say he was male model for clarified butter?” \n“No – he sai..” \n“Did he say he bases his clothing choice on TV test patterns?” \n“NO!” the Boss says. “He… implied that David couldn’t count his buttocks and come up with the same number twice.” \n“Did he?” I ask. \n“Yes,” David says. “In front of the whole office.” \n“Really – pity I missed that. For evidential reasons obviously. \nAnd?” \n“And what?” \n“And….?” I repeat. \n“AND I WANT HIM TO APOLOGISE.” \n“Oh yes. Yes of course. Totally see where you’re coming from. Though…” \n“Though what?” the Boss asks. \n“Well I assume that you’re suggesting that this claim of the PFY’s is a falsehood.” \n“?!” the Boss gags. \n“I mean has anyone actually WITNESSED David counting his arse cheeks and getting the same number twice?” \n“WHAT?” the Boss and David shout simultaneously. \n“Look, I ASSUME that David is quite capable of this, but I mean to say – are we expected to take this on blind faith?” \n“What are you suggesting?” \n“I’m suggesting that David should be able to do this – in front of witnesses. And by witnesses I mean you as the complaint receiver,” I say, pointing at the Boss, “me, as the PFY’s supervisor, and some independent third party – say your PA.” \n“I’m not doing that!” David snaps. \n“So there’s the problem, you see. If you’re not capable of doing it…” \n“Of course I’m capable of doing it!” David snaps. “An IDIOT could do it!” \n“Then if you want an apology…” \n…Two minutes later… \n“So anyway, Rita,” the Boss says, “all you’re here for is just to witness David… um…” \n“Counting his arse cheeks,” I interject. “Twice.” \n“And getting the same number, as it were, both times,” The Boss concludes. \n“In your own time,” I say helpfully to David. “Do you need some time to prepare – do a bit of revision?” \n“Of course I don’t!” David snaps “TWO. TWO. There, done.” \n“So it appears the PFY was correct,” I say to Rita.. “He can’t in fact count his arse che..” \n“What the hell are you talking about?” the Boss says. “He did it.” \n“No, he didn’t count. He just said the number two twice. Didn’t he Rita?” \nRita nods. \n“I don’t need to count them!” David says. \n“Don’t need to, or can’t?” I ask. “You could have got someone to help you, and then memorised the numbers. Obviously I don’t think that’s the case, but we didn’t actually see you COUNT. Did we Rita?” \nRita shakes her head. \n“Alright, if it will clear things up, I’ll bloody count!” David seethes. \n“Excellent. Take your time.” \n“One..” David says. \n“No pressure,” I say. “Just think of it like something you could do any time. Any time at all.” \n“Two,” David says. \n“So the first answer is Two,” I say to Rita. \n“One..” David says, slapping his left buttock. \n“Oh, hang on a minute!” I blurt. “I realise now what I did.” \n“What did you do?” the Boss asks. \n“I interrupted him,” I say. “I assumed he had two buttocks and I interrupted him. He might have been about to say three.” \n“I wasn’t about to say three at all!” David snaps angrily. \n“Well, of course you’d say that now that I’ve given you the answer,” I say. “But actually, the number of buttocks you have – or think you have – is immaterial, as the question is more about getting the same number twice. So I think, maybe, in the interests of fairness, we should start over.” \n“Right,” David says. \n“So in your own time,” I say. “No pressure at all, just a walk in the Park – whenever you’re ready; we’re all on your side here and there are no wrong answers.” \n“Unless you get two different numbers,” Rita adds helpfully. Lovely woman. \n“Look, how about you all just shut up and we do this?!” David says. “One… Two. One… Two. There!” \n“EXCELLENT!” I gasp. “We KNEW you could do it, didn’t we Rita?” \nRita nods. \n“So I think perhaps I should just send the PFY up here to apologise to you, David. No need to make a big production about it – just between us four. Okay?” \n“I… don’t think so. He insulted me in front of my department so he should apologise to me in front of the department.” \n“I don’t think we need to go that far,” I counter. \n“I think we do…” \n…The next day, in Beancounter Central… \n“..and so Stephen has something to say,” David says, milking the sarcasm for all its worth. \n“I… implied that David.. was unable to count his buttocks and get the same number on two occasions. This is not the case, and I apologise.” \n“Thank you,” David says. “I think we’ve all learnt something here today.” \n“Yes,” I add. “And I would like to apologise to you all as well, as Stephen’s supervisor. David proved to me, our manager here and our manager’s PA that he is perfectly able to count his arse cheeks and come up with the same number twice. There were a couple of false starts – true – but he got there in the end. I mean he did need total silence to complete the task, but I put that down to the pressures of the job and maybe just an off day. \nMeantime this has highlighted an area of concern about the way we treat people and their perceptions of how they feel have been treated. A Johari service window, if you will. \nSo I would like to say now, that if you, or any of your co-workers, friends, colleagues, guests or just thin-skinned people you run into on the street have at ANY time felt that the PFY or I have treated you in any way with disrespect we’d like to know about it. \nWe’ve set up an email address of null@localhost.localdomain and we’d like you to email us today. The PFY and I will pick one out randomly each week and meet with you here in a public forum to address it with you. You will be heard. Thank you.” \n…The next day… \n“I didn’t imply that it was an intensely challenging exercise for him to count his arse cheeks and get the same number twice,” I say to the Director. “I simply pointed out what happened when he tried to do it. Rita can back me up on that!” \n“I think you’ll need to apologise,” The Director says. \n“Yes, but do we actually KNOW he can do it easily?” the PFY says. “I mean he might get it right, once or twice, but for a truly conclusive result as to whether it’s difficult or not we’d probably have to see him doing it – what, a hundred times?” \n“Two hundred,” I add. “To be on the safe side.” \n"}

It then suggests I can 'talk to a real person' - which is just another webpage, OR I could PAY for a support call, THEN I get shunted to the Community - which asks me to select the product I want help on - WHICH ISN'T LISTED and which then suggests I want to go to a Virtual Agent.\" \n\"Welcome to the new face of support!\" I cry happily. \"If there was one way of doing things even cheaper than outsourcing support calls to international call centres it's the community approach - where every man and his retarded dog can misinterpret what you're saying and give you a solution which - and this is the best part - is in no way warrantied.\" \n\"Yes, but...\" \nI know, you just want the answer to a simple question from someone with technical knowhow - and those people actually exist in the Community. See, the community is a bit like a glassworks museum inhabited by 10,000 people with tools. One or two of those people will be curators working for the museum and have polishing compound and rags, 10 or 20 will be glassworkers loosely employed by the museum with precision glass repair instruments but the REMAINING 9,900+ are JUST IDIOTS carrying HAMMERS. \n\"So when you ask if anyone knows how to restore the lustre to an 18th century vase because you're thinking of buying one, you're vastly more likely to get one of the cast of thousands tell you that when HE had a problem with his pane of 4mm Perspex - which is LIKE glass - he just hit it with a hammer a couple of times. It didn't have any lustre to start with, but hitting it with a hammer certainly didn't give it any less lustre than it had before, so that's probably the solution.\" \n\"Yes but...\" \n\"Then someone else will comment on the Perspex comment and say the guy is an idiot and that Perspex doesn't have lustre and isn't glass and that what they should be doing is mounting the vase in a ring - because glass is like diamonds, and diamonds always shine when they're in rings.\" \n\"I don't nee..\" \n\"This will be followed by 10 other people agreeing with the Perspex guy and telling meaningless stories that don't go anywhere about how they put a conservatory up using only Perspex and a hammer.\" \n\"!\" \n\"But JUST when you're about to give up hope, one of the glassworkers will say 'Wait, aren't we talking about a vase - not a diamond and definitely not Perspex?\" and you realise that finally someone who knows what they're talking about is there and they will say that because vases are glass, NOT Perspex and NOT diamond you should leave them to obtain a natural lustre because as everyone knows glass is a super-cooled liquid and it will over time move to a more lustrous finish. \n\".\" the PFY says wordlessly \n\"But then five more people will say that the whole super-cooled liquid thing has been disproved and that the hammer is probably the best option.\" \n\"\" \n\"Then one of the curators - the people who are actually RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORT FOR THE PRODUCT - will eventually comment, and they'll say something like - 'Have you tried rebooting the vase?' followed immediately by 'If you have found this comment helpful, please rate this comment with 5 gold stars to prove that I can regurgitate a support script without actually reading the question.\" \n\"Yes, well thanks for your supp...\" \n\"And you'll comment that IT'S A F*CKING VASE, IT DOESN'T NEED REBOOTING! And then the curator will suggest you might want to start an advanced support call for the problem you're having - but you're not HAVING a problem, you just want to know if you can make a second-hand vase shiny again.\" \n\"Moving along...\" the PFY says.. \nBut wait, there's more. They will - and I'm not making this up - suggest you try the virtual agent or maybe contact the support people by phone. And but by then the world is all red and you can feel the fiery rage coursing through every bone in your body and the Boss will come in an say they're thinking of installing 18th century vases in all the meeting rooms but he's a little concerned about how shiny they might not be - so perhaps you could be sure to sign up to some shininess support contract from the company that supplies them... \n>KZZZZZZEEERRRRRRT!< \n"}

It usually starts with me discussing the kit they sold to someone higher up the food chain in the company than me, and then drifts along to getting their signature on a bit of paper cancelling the order. And then, well, no one knows. \n“He seemed a bit despondent,” I usually say. \nIn this case, however, I’m drinking with Crazy Dave – so named because he takes a fairly heavy-handed approach to poaching where sales bonuses are involved – especially from within his own company. He has more than once purchased the PFY’s “stair oil” – a spirit-based lubricant that’s ridiculously slippery for 15 minutes after application but then dries to a tacky surface once the volatiles have evaporated, well before any forensics team might arrive on the scene. \nThe main bonus with Dave however is that five pints of lager are like truth serum to him… \n“So what’re those new PDUs like?” the PFY asks, popping into the pub from the pub across the street where he’d been having a couple of quiets with Dave’s new assistant while I primed Dave with several pints of the local 7% heavy. \n“Barge-pole material,” he snaps, pausing mid-sip. “The sockets are rated at 15amps but at 10 the internals heat up, the prongs get sloppy and your plugs fall out. Then it cools down and the whole process starts again. Though if you drive them at 12amps the plastic in the circuit breaker melts and they’ll be good for 20amps – till the plugs will start falling out – so it’s sort of self-limiting…” \n“They looked fairly sturdy,” The PFY sighs. \n“Oh yeah, you could beat someone to death with them but you wouldn’t want to use one,” Dave blurts. \n“But your assistant showed us it working!” \n“The one RICK showed you had the guts replaced – no breakers, copper contacts,” Dave insists. \n“He said we could trial one?” I ask, recalling a section of his presentation. \n“Rick SAID that,” he says, in a tone that hints that young Rick may well be starring in a Led Zeppelin-inspired incident in the near future, “but they’ll never let you have one because they're so bad. They’ll either sell you one with no warranty or some cretin at the call centre will upsell you our 6RU modular PDU – only slightly less rubbish but about 10 times the price.” \n“So we can’t have a trial one?” \n“There’s NO trial,” he repeats testily. “It’s a ploy to disrupt the existing supply chain by farming the sale process out to a call centre.” \nSomeone sounds defensive. \n“So why are you pushing the PDUs so hard?” the PFY asks. \n“We HAVE to get stock numbers down before we can legitimately EOL them,” he admits, reaching for another pint. “There’s a pantload in a warehouse up north and we need them gone before the electrical safety laws change. Speaking of which, you didn’t buy any of those rack-top extraction fans from us did you?” \n“Uhh yes..” \n“AH!” he replies, finishing his pint in record time. “Apparently the fan blades were poorly balanced and the vibration cracks the insulation on the coils over time. Best case scenario the motor burns out; worst case it’ll trip out the rack circuit breaker.” \n“So what’s your approach to server rack hotspots going to be if not extraction fans?” the PFY asks, knowing full well that extraction fans are the most advanced cooling technology they have. \n“Put your sensitive gear down the bottom of the rack,” he admits. “We’ll pay some academic to fake some rack heat stats, publish a white paper called ‘Locational thermal efficiency curves in server farm environments’, then market it as our green initiative – before EOL-ing the fans to avoid warranty claims – like yours.” \n“EOL sounds so much better than RECALL doesn’t it?” \n“Yes, but we’re saying it’s our Company’s commitment to climate change awareness. We’ll lose the spares in a terrible over-insured shipping accident and upsell existing clients to something newer.” \nI detect no remorse at all in Dave. \n“So I take it your trainee doesn’t know all this?” \n“Rick? Nah, he’s an intern and wants to be a process streamlining strategist – whatever the hell that is...” Dave foams. “So... are you interested in anything you saw today?” \n“Would you be?” I ask. \n“Those little UPS units I showed you aren’t the worst thing we’ve stocked. We’ve overstated the figures – everyone does – but the electronics are solid. Slap new batteries in them after a year or and they’d probably do you far better than a big name unit.” \n“Can we order them online?” the PFY teases. \n“YOU CAN’T ORDER THEM ONLINE! Dave snaps. \n“Only Rick said we could use the websi...” the PFY starts. \n“YOU CAN’T USE THE BLOODY WEBSITE!” he gags angrily. \n“But Rick said it’s the way of the futu...” \n“IT’S NOT THE WAY OF THE FUTURE!” he rages. \n“He said he could get us a discount if when he signed us up to your ordering portal...” \n>SLAM< \nAnd just like that, Crazy Dave is gone. Pausing only to stop at his car to retrieve the demonstration PDU from his back seat, he stalks off in the direction of the pub that young Rick was meeting his mates at. \nIt was all lies, though. I think the PFY’s entire conversation with Rick was about PUBG play strategies. \nHis big mistake was showing the PFY several screenshots of “losers” he had “deep-sixed” with his “S12K”. \nI noticed the PFY got a bit twitchy at Rick’s description of how he beat a loser named StephenP007 to death with the frypan. \nThat wasn’t strategic. \n"}

It’s 11:30am, I’ve not seen the PFY all morning and there’s a cold, half eaten chicken kebab sitting on the PFY’s keyboard. \nThere’s a faint beeping noise from his desktop machine as the password field of his login is overflowing with H characters, courtesy of the kebab. \nI whip over to his desk to confirm my suspicions – the kebab is very, very cold. Sometime in the past two hours the PFY has come and gone from this office while I was away attending to an urgent problem – or as some people call it, having a couple of coffees and doing the crossword in the café across the road. \nThe presence of a kebab is worrying enough in and of itself as an indicator of a drunk person on site, but a glacially cold kebab with solidified fat can only mean one thing – bender. A bender where you spend the last hour or two wandering round deserted streets with half of the kebab you bought three hours ago, that you’re saving for later. \nThis is bad. \nThe Boss strolls in with a slight measure of triumph on his face, braced by an HR droid, Security and someone in an impeccably cut suit sporting a sharp tie and a razor thin plain face wristwatch. Legal. \nOh, this is bad. \n“Is Stephen in?” he asks, feigning innocence. \n“Stephen, no, he’s on holiday today,” I respond quickly – pointing to the PFY’s empty wheelie chair. \n“I don’t think he is.” \n“Sure he is; I remember seeing him filling in the leave form yesterday.” \n“No, I didn’t get any leave form.” \n“Are you sure?” I ask. \n“Positive.” \n“Perhaps you should check your Inbox again?” I suggest. \nSo the Boss is stuffed. He KNOWS that in the time it takes him to get back to his office and wait for his desktop to boot (after some mysterious reset) I will have faked a leave form, backdated it in the database and then updated the reason field on the PFY’s leave request with something like “Attending a church presentation on the dangers of VIAGRA” which will trip the Boss’ junk mail filter giving a perfectly sound reason why the PFY’s leave request wasn’t seen. \nI think I even have a script for that. \nAs a matter of fact, while the Boss is deciding what to do I fire up the script and type in the reason text. \n“We would like to have a serious misconduct meeting tomorrow morning at 9am. SHARP,” the Boss snaps angrily. \n“A support person is permitted to attend,” The HR guy says to me. “I assume that would be you?” \n“As a member of the brotherhood of practising IT professionals it would be remiss of me not to. So I hope someone’s going to fill me in on what supposed misconduct has occurred?” \n“I’ll send you an email documenting the last few hours,” the Legal bloke says, nodding to the Boss, Security and the HR guy as he leaves, followed shortly thereafter by everyone else except Security, who has been instructed to wait for the PFY and escort him from the property. \n“Ah well, I’ll just have to finish soldering the transistors onto the flux capacitor,” I tell Security as I wander off into the server room, before starting a building-wide search for the PFY. \nI know he’s still in the building because he’d never abandon a kebab whilst under the influence. After checking all the toilets, the lunchroom, stores and any other location that would possibly appeal to a sleepy drunk, I am at a loose end. \nIt’s just chance that I happen to see him approaching the building from the very café I was in earlier, no doubt having several double espressos. I intercept him and EVENTUALLY convince him that home is a far better location than work… \n…The next day, 9am… \n“Morning Gents!” I snap, striding into the meeting room, full of the joy of life. “Shall we get started? \nI’ve read the list of issues which you believe indicate misconduct and feel sure that it’s all a misunderstanding which we can clear up in no time.” \n“We can’t start the meeting until Stephen is here,” the Boss says coldly. \n“Really? No one told me that! All you said was a support person could attend. I am a support person with full authority to act on Stephen’s behalf.” \nWhich is completely true. The PFY, however, could probably not act on his own behalf unless the acting concerned included interaction with a sizable porcelain bowl – having not heeded my suggestion to go straight home and not stop off for elevenses. Or twelveses, oneses, twoses, etc. \nWithdrawal is probably the stage he’s in just at the moment. \n“Very well, if you have permission to act on his behalf, we would like to address what happened yesterday morning,” Legal says. “I’ll be auditing this meeting.” \n“Fine by me - and I’ve read the emailed list. Perhaps we can address these issues one at a time?” \n“He arrived at work drunk,” HR says. “He arrived – but not to work. AND we have no policy indicating the required sobriety of people in the building.” \n“We have a reasonable expectation of sobriety,” HR counters. \n“Ah – has this been communicated to the members of the board? Only I did happen to notice about six weeks ago after a lengthy ‘Board Meeting’ two of them poured out of the lift at our floor, believing they were in the basement Car Park.” \n“Yes, well, moving right along,” HR says quickly. \n“He then went up to your floor, urinated into the pot plant outside your manager’s office,” Legal says... \n“So we’ve tested that it was urine?” I ask. \n“No.” \n“Oh, so someone SAW him urinating in the pot plant?” I ask, knowing full well from camera footage that he was alone. \n“No, but we know he stopped there for quite some time.” \n“Time enough to water the plant with this?” I ask, pulling a small watering can out of my bag. \n“You can’t be suggesting that he…” \n“Stopped into work – on his day off, no less – to ensure his favourite Ficus was watered?” I counter. \n“And watered the floor and wall while he was at it?” the Boss asks sarcastically. \n“Ficus are very temperamental when it comes to overwatering – which you’d know if you spent as much time caring for them as Stephen does.” \n“He was extremely offensive to your manager here,” Legal indicates. \nAnd now we get to a bit of trickier ground. \n“A simple misheard phrase.” I say. “The Boss suggested he’d had a particularly good night to which the PFY replied in the affirmative.” \n“He used several more graphic words than that,” HR counters. \n“Maybe the Boss just thought he did – remember that time he didn’t even know the PFY had filled out a leave form?” \n“He threw a printer across the room at me.” \n“Our room, if I’m not mistaken?” I ask. \n“And?” \n“And you were standing in the doorway?” \n“So?” \n“Beside the rubbish bin? Honestly, if the poor bloke can’t come in, water a plant and get some recycling done I have no idea what the world is coming to. If it wasn’t for has-beens like you interfering he’d have been in and out doing his good deeds.” \n“Has-Beens?!” the HR bloke says. \n“Oh, not you,” I gasp. “No, you’re more of a never-was than a has-been.” \nOur meeting is interrupted by a quiet but feverish tapping. The Boss answers, there’s some whispering and the door closes. The Boss has turned a couple of shades redder than his usual pasty. \n“I think we should probably need to stop this meeting now and afford Simon the opportunity to get some legal advice,” he seethes. \n“Really?” I ask, “Why’s that?” \n“I’ve just been told what happened immediately before this meeting.” \n“Oh, you mean the Pot Plant. The PFY noticed that while it was OK for water it might need a little fertiliser – so I sorted that out on the way here. Paper’s biodegradable isn’t it?” \n“I think we need to call security,” The Boss says. \n“What, for me?” I ask. “Why? I’m on holiday!” \n“You’re bloody not!” the Boss says. \nAnd we’re back at that same place again, only the Boss’ office is much closer than my desktop. \nHe made a mad dash for the door before I could react (which is not that quickly after a six-pint breakfast) and leapt outside just as the PFY’s Chekhovian wheely chair whizzed by. \nThere’s a scream, a crash, a quick clicky-clicky and everything is back to normal. \n“Oh, did I mention that Stephen was auditing this meeting as well?” I ask, pointing to my phone. \n* With apologies to the late, great Mad Magazine artist Don Martin – the master of the written sound effect . \n"}

Why didn't you say brainstorming, instead of using a 20-quid word like ideation?\" \n\"Well it's quicker for a start.\" \n\"Even after I had to ask you to explain it to me?\" \n\"Perhaps not initially, but I'm sure we're on track now. Anyway, we put a lot of time into ideation sessions...\" \n\"He means brainstorming,\" the PFY says to me. \n\"I think he knows what ideation means,\" the suit says, getting a little snippy. \n\"No, no, he's right,\" I admit. \"I have a shocking attention span when it comes to the 20-quid words that my assistant was talking about.

Or rather I do when I have found some risqué conference photos on a cellphone I'm unbricking – or when I have an extremely heavy piece of hardware that is reluctant to exit the building via our window when a particularly annoying person is attempting to pry the 1 quid coin I superglued to the footpath directly below. Apart from that, though, nope.\" \n\"Well it's a word. It means using a business asset in a way which will help affect an outcome in another business asset.\" \n\"Right you are! So you're doing all that to our market perception?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"By updating the front page of our website.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"For 20 thousand quid.\" \n\"That's an estimate of our expense.\" \n\"Well I know where the first quid of that 20k will come from if you want to pop outside to the street below to get it while I find my crowbar.\" \n\"I don't think that will be necessary,\" the Boss says drily. \"Let's just crack on shall we?\" \n\"As I was saying, the ideation...\" \n\"Brainstorming,\" the PFY mumbles to me. \n\"...session identified some learnings from a similar exercise we...\" \n\"Learnings, you said?\" I interrupt. \"Not lessons?\" \n\"No, learnings. From a lesson you might get learnings – things you learnt.\" \n\"And you couldn't say lessons? Or knowledge?\" \n\"Moving along,\" the Boss says. \n\"We identified some learnings,\" he continues, \"which we put into practice with your your company's public-facing image.\" \n\"You mean the front page of the website?\" \n\"Yes. So we spitballed a couple of ideas...\" \n\"Brainstormed,\" the PFY mumbles. \n\"...let them marinate for a while.\" \n\"Charged another 40 hours to the job while fart-arsing around on some other client's project,\" the PFY adds. \n\"And pivoted your interface into a gamification activity.\" \n\"Changed it into something that a child could use – because only a child would want to.\" \n\"I...\" the suit says. \n\"Did you say gamification?\" I asked. \n\"Yes, it's a model of using gameplay elements to engage with the website.\" \n\"Which game are we talking exactly?\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well which game are you trying to make it like? I'm quite a fan of murder in the dark. Get the lights, will you, Stephen?\" \n\"I DON'T think that will be necessary,\" the Boss says, turning back to the suit. \"Please continue.\" \n\"So with the gamified interface we could get some pretty good key takeaways about client engagement.\" \n\"You mean takeaways like an Indian? Or a nice kebab?\" the PFY asks. \n\"He means indicators of client use of the website,\" the Boss bossplains. \"So tell me, how would this be done?\" \n\"Well, we'd on-board a couple of gamification ninjas to iterate a few possible strategies to solutionise the overarching interaction issue.\" \n\"I have no idea what he just said, but he mentioned gingers,\" the PFY mumbles. \n\"So the extra staff – they're included in your estimate?\" \n\"Ah no, the 20k figure was the analysis of what is wrong with your current public face by one of our usability gurus. The solutionisation of that interface is a separate contract and would involve a couple of gamification ninjas working with one of our in-house design rockstars.\" \n\"You know some rockstars?\" the PFY asks. \n\"So all up, what are we looking at?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The whole shooting match? Probably around 45, 50. 60 if you want us to reach out to a vibe manager to really put a shine on it.\" \n\"OK,\" the Boss says. \"I think we've made some real progress here.

The Boss, bless him, thinks it's a routine process aimed at solidifying the company's position in the marketplace (blah, blah, blah), however the PFY and I know better having accidentally been bcc-ed in on a private email exchange discussing a possible company merger with a rival firm. \nA quick review of the company concerned indicates that they are large enough to consume our company whole whilst leaving room for dessert, a cheese board and several after-dinner cognacs. \n\"Obviously this will mean a change in the staffing levels for both companies,\" the Boss says, once we explain the true nature of the audit to him. \n\"Or just our company,\" I hint. \n\"There's bound to be a little duplication of tasks but we're sure to be integrated into the corporate body,\" he argues naively. \n\"I think our only interaction with the 'corporate body' will be when they wipe their corporate arse of us.\" \n\"You think so?\" the Boss asks nervously. \nDefinitely. They have an entire infrastructure that our company would be integrated into - making much of this company effectively redundant. \n\"So... that's it for us then?\" \n\"For you, yes,\" the PFY says. \n\"Well what about you?\" the Boss simpers. \n\"Oh, they'll probably keep us on. As they say in the corporate world, we know where the bodies are buried,\" the PFY smiles. \n\"Or more importantly,\" I add, \"we know that there's room for some more bodies...\" \n\"Can't you do something?\" the Boss blurts, trying to get the words out before the auditors arrive at Mission Control. \n\"What's it worth?\" the PFY asks. \nOne hour and a company whip-round later, the PFY and I have a lot more cash than we started the day with – which puts us in a good mood for our first meeting with the auditors. They're a bleak bunch of suits from the prospective takeover company and want to talk about our computing practices. \n\"So can you outline your password policies?\" the first of the suits asks, starting at the top of his checklist. \n\"Oh, we don't have any of those,\" I say. \n\"None? No complexity, age, minimum and maximum change times, minimum and maximum lengths, reuse restrictions, etc?\" \n\"No, none,\" I say. \"It makes it too hard for people to remember each others' passwords if they're always changing.\" \n\"You don't enforce ANY password policies?!\" he gasps, putting a cross through the first eight checkboxes on his page. \n\"No.\" \n\"What about file security?\" he continues. \n\"Safe as houses!\" I say. \"We keep most of the business data on one of our servers.\" \n\"You say most?\" \n\"Yeah, well, sometimes people work on stuff from home and don't get a chance to upload it to the website so they keep it on a USB key or their home machine or something.\" \n\"What about commercially sensitive documents, intellectual property and the like?\" \n\"Yes, that's the stuff. We try to make it as simple as possible for people to be able to work on their files, without all that unnecessary complexity with access lists and VPNs and audit trails. And the system runs a lot faster without it.\" \n\"Backups?\" the second bloke asks. \n\"Regular as clockwork!\" the PFY says proudly. \"We back everything up to a DAT drive once a month. EVERYTHING. EVERY month! AND we have three different tapes – not just one.\" \n\"No daily backups?\" \n\"Not unless someone specifically asks. If that happens we check with all the users and do it when requested – but after we notify people we're doing it. We have a policy on notification prior to backups.\" \n\"Why?\" auditor 2 asks. \n\"To make sure we don't back up stuff that people don't want backed up.\" \n\"So you don't take any backups apart from a monthly?\" \n\"Not normally, no.\" \n\"Aren't you afraid of loss of data from viruses, encryption ransomware?\" \n\"Please. We haven't had one of those for WEEKS!\" I counter. \n\"And it serves as a good lesson to people to be vigilant when it DOES happen,\" the PFY adds sagely. \n\"So let me get this straight – you don't have a password policy, you don't have audit trails on file access and modification, and you don't take incremental backups on a regular basis.\" \n\"Mmmmmmm. No,\" the PFY says thoughtfully. \n\"Well, you realise that this would change under the merger?\" the first auditor shoots back. \"And frankly, I think there would be some questions asked about your professional competency.\" \n\"Fair enough,\" I reply. \"Though we used to implement pretty much all of that at one point, but after that big asbestos thing we were instructed by Legal to ensure that nothing we did would affect the board's ability to the use of the plausible deniability defence.\" \n\"What asbestos thing?\" auditor 2 asks nervously. \"Was there asbestos in this building?\" \n\"Ah... No?\" I say, phrasing my response as a question. \n\"So you didn't discover asbestos in the ceiling or piping or building infrastructure.\" \n\"In the building?\" I ask, faking relief. \"No. I mean, not in the structure or fittings, no.\" \n\"But there was asbestos somewhere else?\" \n\"No, no. Well, probably not. See, it all depends on whether the packages for our products were opened or not. Mostly I think they went out unopened and so everything was fine.\" \n\"Your company was MAKING things with asbestos?\" he gasps. \n\"Look, it was a different time then,\" I say. \"And it looked like asbestos would make great heatproof kitchen furniture.\" \n\"And there's a record of this?\" \n\"I can ASSURE you there is NO record of this anywhere in the company,\" I say. \n\"We destroyed all the backup tapes at the time and we have a six-month maximum email retention policy,\" the PFY adds. \"No loose ends.\" \n\"In fact,\" I add, \"the factory was demolished and the land sold to the school next door so there's probably no record the company was even there.\" \n... \nQuicker than you can say \"criminal liability\" the deal is off and the company concerned has left the stadium. The PFY and I put in for all the extra overtime we'll need to do to reinstate the backup regimes that we never deleted in the first place. \nChicken dinner time at Mission Control. \n"}

It's hard to argue with those numbers!\" \n\"So you don't think new technology is worth it?\" the Boss simpers. \n\"Not really – though if you could IoT pet rock I think you'd be getting somewhere. It's the perfect match of useless information about a useless object.\" \n\"I can't believe you're talking this way. Surely you have a vested interest in new technology?\" \n\"Don't get me wrong – I LOVE new technology. I have a standing alert on new tech on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. However I don't share your blind faith in new technology being the solution to a problem we haven't got at the moment – because we live in different places.\" \n\"I'm not sure I'm with you,\" the Boss murmurs. \n\"It's simple,\" I say, drawing an all-too-familiar wavy line on the whiteboard. \"You live here, in the Peak of Inflated Expectations whereas the PFY and myself live here, in the Trough of Disillusionment. To you, new technology is a tree structure with branches leading to infinite possibilities but to us its an inverted tree structure with infinite paths leading to disappointment.\" \n\"I hardly think we...\" \n\"And even this wouldn't be so bad, except that projects never live long enough to get to the Plateau of Productivity because by the time we've found a problem that could actually MAKE USE of a solution you've been banging on about you've shut the whole thing down in favour of some other magic bean technology which has no current application or relevance to the company at this time.\" \n\"Yes but...\" \n\"So what happens is that we implement every glittering IT fad that catches your corporate ADHD attention span and then shut it all down again when you see the next shiny object.\" \n\"Yes, I can see your point,\" the Boss says thoughtfully. \"But this Blockchain stuff sounds like the real deal. AND it can be used to make money. Imagine that – we could make money just by having it! And the value of it just increases with time, so even if we DID get rid of it at a later date it would be worth vastly more than we paid for it!!!\" \n\"You've been reading up on this, haven't you?\" I ask. \n\"Yes! And I have to say, as a technology it seems really exciting.\" \n\"Okay,\" I say, \"JUST THIS ONCE we'll suspend our natural cynicism and give it a crack – just this once, mind.\" \n\"Excellent!\" the Boss chortles, rocking off back to his office on the wings of victory. \n\"Really?\" the PFY says. \n\"Really,\" I sigh. \n\"So we're going to fire up blockchain to roll out a non-existent problem in a non-existent project for some untenable result.\" \n\"Oh no.

So I try to register again, but it tells me I'm already registered. I enter my username - the only username I ever use with this company - and it tells me I don't have a Smart Portal account and I will need to register one.\" \n\"Uhh...\" \n\"..so obviously I will try the 'forgot my password' link >click< - which doesn't work because I need to know my username first, but then I can >clicky< on my forgot my username link and it prompts me for my email. I enter that >tappity< and then >Bing< I check my email and my username is the one I tried before.\" \n\"Uh, OK.\" \n\"And it still doesn't work. But if I >click< on My Account at the top of a page I get a page like the one I saw before, but this also has a Smart Portal link, which, if I >click< on it BRINGS ME TO THE SMART PORTAL AND I'M LOGGED IN!!!!\" \n\"Finally,\" The Boss says. \n\"Except that there's no support contract information on the profile - BUT I can go to my profile manager, which isn't my Smart Portal manager, it's my main profile manager. If I >clicky< on that it says I have a support contract and do I want to convert that to an active support contract.\" \n\"Ah. Good.\" \n\"It gets better!\" I say. \"The contract, if I view it, says that support started 3 weeks ago and lasts for 1 year, so the contract is ticking over but it isn't active because I haven't activated it.\" \n\"But it's showing up on your account.\" \n\"Yes. So I >click< activate it and NOW I need to create an active contract profile in which I lodge all my active contracts. When I >tappity< >click< do this I FINALLY have an ACTIVE contract on a REGISTERED device with an AUTHORISED USER.\" \n\"Good.\" \n\"So it comes as no surprise when I can't download the software because I have no support contract.\" \n\"Did you call their support line?\" \n\"Yes, but let's do it again.\" \n23 minutes later... \n\"Hi, I'm Dave at Support Central how can I help?\" a voice answers. \n\"I have a support contract that's showing up under my profile but which doesn't permit me to download any software.\" \n\"Is is a Smart Contract or a normal contract?\" Dave asks. \n\"I'm unsure Dave, how can I tell?\" \n\"Well in the bottom of the box that the device came with there will be a piece of paper which has - or doesn't have - the word 'SMART' before the name.\" \n\"Was it a red piece of paper?\" I ask. \n\"No.\" \n\"Did it have the words DO NOT DISCARD on it in large letters?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"But without it I take it there will be some sort of get-out-of-jail-free clause in the whole contract agreement?\" \n\"I... it's got the contract info on it,\" he says. \"It's intrinsic to the support process.\" \n\"Would it be a piece of paper which is extremely similar in look and feel to the Electrical Safety Sheet, the Unpacking This Device Sheet, the Safe Disposal of unnecessary packing sheet - as well as all the above sheets in every language known to man, along with something not unlike the voyager golden record - in case aliens ever get one and we need to kill them with pointless bloody documentation?\" \n\"I... don't know.\" \n\"Tell me Dave, why would you PRINT a document telling you how to dispose of printed documents?\" \n\"Well, I...\" \n\"It doesn't matter\" I say. \"That page, along with ALL the other pages and the rest of the packaging is now probably buried 2 feet deep in a landfill just north of Leeds - which, incidentally, is an eventuality you should be preparing yourself for if you start telling me about how important licence document management is.\" \n\"It's just that we need to validate the...\" \n\"Dave,\" I say. \"I've entered the Key in the system. It's been accepted, and alongside the licence key there's a picture of our device, along with the SERIAL NUMBER - OF OUR DEVICE. Your system KNOWS I have a licence.

I have to check with my supervisor.\" \n\"Go right ahead,\" I say. \"We'll wait.\" \n\"He's not here today. He was here yesterday but he went out for lunch and he didn't come back.

I'm dangerous!'","Link":"\/2018\/05\/25\/bofh_2018_episode_9\/","Content":"Episode 9 I'm already in a bit of a foul mood when the Boss calls me into his office for \"a quick word\" . The office Health and Safety enthusiast is there too so I know the meeting will be neither quick nor a single word. \n\"It's about the ladder,\" he says. \n\"What ladder?\" I ask. \n\"The ladder in the hallway yesterday,\" the H&S freak chips back. \"With no cones around it.\" \n\"There was no ladder in the hallway yesterday,\" I reply. \n\"Yes there was,\" he continues, \"it was under the wireless thingy.\" \n\"There was no ladder in the hallway,\" I repeat. \n\"Yes there was – and you were on it,\" he snaps back. \n\"No I wasn't!\" \n\"You were, I saw you!\" \n\"Ah you're right – so there was. What's the point?\" \n\"There were no cones out.\" \n\"And yet you still managed to see me. And the ladder.\" \n\"That's not the point.\" \n\"What is the point?\" I ask. \n\"Someone might have accidentally walked into the ladder.\" \n\"But you could see me and the ladder.\" \n\"There were no cones.\" \n\"But if I'd put cones out, at the recommended 3 metres from the obstruction, 500mm apart, I'd have blocked the corridor.\" \n\"It would have kept people safe.\" \n\"Not if there'd been a fire it wouldn't – the corridor's part of the fire exit path. Are we allowed to block that with cones?\" \nImpasse. \n\"Perhaps you should be doing it after hours,\" he suggests. \n\"What, and risk a fall or a heart attack with no one noticing until someone turned up at work possibly hours later? That sounds reckless. I can't believe you'd suggest that!\" \n\"You have an assistant.\" \n\"But what happens if HE had a fall and I didn't notice because I was up the ladder in the ceiling space?!\" \n\"You could have someone just keep an eye on him,\" he suggests. \n\"THREE lots of overtime. I like the way you think!\" \n\"I think we may have drifted a little off topic,\" the Boss blurts, knowing the penal rates in the contracts the PFY and I organised. \"Let's just get back to the ladder.\" \n\"So a 6ft ladder with an almost 6ft me on it – which is somehow less visible than a 3ft cone?\" \n\"The cone is orange,\" The H&S enthusiast points out. \"It's a warning colour, and means danger.\" \n\"Which is why I always carry a carrot for self-defence,\" the PFY chips in. \nLead balloon. \n\"And I think I saw a pumpkin follow me home the other day,\" I add. \nStill nothing. \n\"So the issue isn't the size of the object, just the colour?\" I continue. \n\"The issue is visibility.\" \n\"But you could see me. And the ladder!\" \n\"But not if my attention was elsewhere!\" \n\"So the real problem appears to be employing people who don't watch where they're going?\" \n\"THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT DANGEROUS THINGS SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED FOR PERSONAL SAFETY!!!\" he rants. \n\"ALRIGHT, so I think we have some learnings from this meeting about colours and visibility and now you've raised it I'll personally assure you that we'll be implementing them as soon as possible! Health and Safety is our highest priority!\" the Boss blurts loudly, drawing the meeting to a close before any personal grievances can arise. \n... The next day ... \n\"What the hell are you wearing?\" the Boss asks. \n\"What? You mean my orange trousers, orange shirt or my orange shoes – which, incidentally, I purchased with our Health and Safety budget? We're all out of orange face paint, though – the PFY used it all – so I'm not 100 per cent safe just yet.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Well, yesterday afternoon we did a little bit of analysis on the commonality of workplace accidents in the building and it occurred to us that we are present at a truly staggering number of workplace accidents! 75 per cent of accidents overall and 97 per cent of serious accidents. That being the case, we thought that wearing orange would highlight some form of danger in our vicinity and that people would be more careful around us.\" \n\"Why's the stairwell painted orange?\" the Director asks, popping his head around the Boss's doorway. \n\"Almost 38 per cent of serious workplace accidents occur in stairwells. We painted them last night – because of the danger. We ran out of paint before we could do windows, which are an even higher – 44 per cent!\" \n\"So what, you're just going to go around painting things orange?\" the Director asks. \n\"Ladders were the first thing we painted but we realised they were only involved in 0.5 per cent of workplace accidents – and painting them orange would have no effect anyway.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Both those accidents were where a ladder fell out of a window onto an accountant – so orange or not, they'd never see it coming.\" \n\"All right – so you're suggesting that painting dangerous things orange will somehow make the workplace safer?\" \n\"Bound to.\" \n\"Won't people just see orange everywhere to the point that it fails to become noticeable?\" the Director asks. \n\"I shouldn't think so, I mean we...\" \nOur conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a completely orange PFY. \n\"There's been a terrible workplace accident!\" he gasps. \"You know how our H&S person doesn't take the lift?\" \n\"9 per cent of serious workplace accidents,\" I murmur. \n\"Ah, yes,\" the Boss says. \n\"Well, he was coming up the stairs as I was going down the stairs and when I said good morning to him he got a fright and had a bit of a tumble.\" \n(That story sounds so much better than \"waited in a dark corner of the stairwell then shouted 'Boo!'\" ) \n\"Right – so I want those stairwells back to grey as soon as possible!\" the Director snaps. \n\"I don't know we'll be able to do it today, but we might be able to bash it out in overtime,\" I say. \"Because Health and Safety is, after all, our highest priority!\" \nStill time for the PFY to welcome the head beancounter to work then... \n"}

What are you pointing at?\" \n\"My contacts,\" he says, jabbing at his phone with a chubby finger. \n\"What... about your contacts?\" \n\"Look!\" he says, moving the stubby digit from his phone screen to an area of his Outlook contacts then back again. \"See?\" \n\"See what?\" \n\"DAVIS,\" he says. \"PETER.\" \n\"You've lost me.\" \n\"It's not on my phone.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And it should be on my phone. It should be synced to my phone!\" \n\"Is your phone set to have your work email as its primary source of Contacts, with push syncing enabled?\" \n\"Yes!\" he says in the tone of voice that implies he has no idea of what I'm talking about. \n\"Is it REALLY?\" I ask. \n\"OF COURSE IT IS!\" he snaps with the outrage combo-deal of me doubting both his honesty and his technical ability. \n\"Well I'll just look at the Outlook Management App,\" I say, pulling my cellphone out of my pocket. \n\"Don't you manage Outlook from your desktop?\" he asks, wanting me out of the office to give him the opportunity to blunder around his phone settings to make sure that syncing is actually on like he said. \n\"Nah, it's all in the cloud now. I just fire up the app, click on your username, and then just check when the last sync was done. It'll only take a moment.\" \n\"Well I've got a meeting to go to,\" the Boss lies, grabbing his diary and a pen. \n\"Really?\" I ask. \"We'd better take a look at your calendar syncing too then, as it's not showing up on Outlook.\" \nOf course it's all lies. I can't see his Contact syncing records and I have absolutely no idea what's in his calendar – I just know he's lying through his teeth. \n\"It's a... personal appointment,\" the Boss says, grasping for a credible lie. \n\"It should still show up as a blocked-out blob in your diary.\" \n\"Well I don't know why it's not but we can talk about it when I get back from my meeting.\" \n\"It's OK,\" I say. \"I'll walk with you and take a look at your phone on the way.\" \n\"Uh... I'm expecting a personal call,\" he blurts. \"I need to be able to answer it at a moment's notice.\" \nI have to give the Boss a bit of respect for being able to lie on the fly like this, but he's still got to be punished. \n\"I really think we need to look at this now – it could be affecting other people at work. It's too big to ignore – think of all the people out of the office who may not be syncing.\" \n\"It's just Contacts!\" the Boss whines. \n\"And Calendars,\" I add. \"If people's Calendars aren't syncing then they could be missing out on important meetings!\" \n\"It's probably my desktop machine!\" the Boss snaps back. Now he's created a pile of lies so high he's getting liars' vertigo. \n\"Are you sure?\" \n\"Yes, yes, there's probably something wrong with it. It's been doing odd things for a couple of weeks.\" \n\"Ah well, perhaps I should take a look at it?\" \n\"Would you?\" he asks, still not wanting to back down. \"I'll be out for an hour or so.\" \n\"Sure.\" \n... One hour of him wandering around the building like Scott No-mates later ... \n\"Uh... my machine?\" the Boss asks, entering Mission Control after spotting the empty space on his desk. \n\"It's a mystery to me,\" I say, pointing at the huge pile of parts strewn over my desk. \"I looked in your calendar but there wasn't any appointment there either!!!\" \n\"Wasn't my desktop locked?\" \n\"With the password Eugene2006 – your son's name and birth year?\" the PFY asks – being as he is a virtual crap-password cracking savant. \n\"So, my machine?\" \n\"Here it is,\" I say, pointing at the parts. \"At first I just reseated the RAM. Then I reseated the processor. I replaced the power supply, ran some hardware diagnostics, but still no calendar entry. I ran a non-destructive disk test against all the hard drives then booted a LiveCd on the machine to see if the problem was something to do with your settings. Nothing. So then we brought it back here to examine each component individually.\" \nAgain mostly lies, the biggest one being the words \"non-destructive\" . After I'd erased his hard drive the PFY took every single nut, bolt and screw out of everything. Even the power supply is in pieces. \n\"I don't know what to say,\" I continue. \"I can't find a thing wrong with it. You're SURE that the meeting was in your calendar?\" \n\"Positive!\" he lies. \n\"And you're sure your work contacts are set as the primary contacts for your phone?\" \n\"Yes I'm sure.\" \n\"Well, I guess it's some conflict with your private email and calendars and stuff,\" I say, nodding at the PFY. \"We'll need your phone.\" \n\"I need it – I'm expecting another call.\" \n\"No problems!\" the PFY says. \"We'll forward your phone to your desk phone while we check it out.\" \n\"It's my personal phone – it has a lot of personal information on it.\" \n\"That's OK – we'll take a clone image of it, you reset your phone to factory defaults then we can test it without ever accessing your personal data. You'll just need to enter a secure encryption and decryption key to back it up and restore it.\" \n\"You can do that now?\" the Boss asks, liking the idea of a zeroed phone which can't prove anything. \n\"Sure, plug the phone into the recovery PC over there...\" \nTen minutes later the phone is cloned and erased and handed over to the PFY. \n\"OK, let's take a look at this,\" the PFY says, examining the phone from all angles. \"It's hard to see under this lig... >woops<\" \n... \n\"It might still be OK,\" the PFY says, as we all gaze down at the Boss's phone on the road two floors below. \nA cab passes. \n\"Ah well, maybe not. Sorry about that,\" the PFY says, with the kind of sincerity that could have had him in PR for Union-Carbide in 84 . \"We'll organise you a backup phone till insurance gets you a new one.\" \n>Shuffle< \n\"This is all we have at the moment,\" I say, pulling out a flip phone which was last in fashion when leg-warmers were cool and which would only \"sync\" in water. \"Unfortunately because of its age you won't be able to recover stuff to it. I'd just key in your most used numbers.\" \nThe Boss wanders off annoyed – but not as annoyed as he'll be when he finds out that \"cloned and erased\" actually just means \"erased\" . Amazing how people will trust web forms that say \"Enter your unique Encryption Key\" , \"Re-enter your unique Encryption Key\" and then shows a progress bar for five minutes. \nBut that'll be after three hours of him entering combinations of his password with and without the shift key... \n"}

The less technical the documentation is the longer the documentation tends to be...\" \n\"And which language do you think I read in?\" \n\"The same language you use to email me,\" I say evasively. \n\"Which is?\" \n\"Have you ever noticed how long your email messages to me are?\" I ask \"And how long my replies to you tend to be?\" \nThere, I said it. \n\"So which language do you mean?\" \nOK, so I said it, but in plain English. \n\"Idiot,\" I say. \n\"What?!\" the Boss seethes. \n\"It's OK, though,\" I explain, \"because a technical manual is for technical people. It's not meant for an audience without the acumen to understand it. You wouldn't expect to open a textbook on knot theory and understand the mathematical equations therein would you?\" \n\"I suppose not,\" he admits grudgingly. \n\"And so in a similar way you really can't expect to understand the nuances of domain synchronisation, virtual machine tuning or even cryptographic key manipulation.\" \n\"You may be right,\" he sighs, wandering up to look over my shoulder. \"What are you writing about now?\" \n\"How to get good onion bhajis at lunchtime.\" \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"The onion bhajis. To get the best ones you need to wait for the first batch to go through as they're probably reheated ones from the last time bhajis were on the menu. That said, you need to be in the queue when they resupply with fresh bhajis. Ideally you need to be six people down the line when the dish gets to about a third full of the first batch so that the fresh bhajis are served just as you get there.\" \n\"What the hell has this got to do with technical documentation?!\" \n\"It's documentation for an IT professional – we like our lunches.\" \n\"And that's something that I wouldn't understand is it?\" \n\"You always eat from the first batch,\" I point out. \"QED.\" \n\"This documentation better not be all about meals!\" \n\"YOU said I had to cover all aspects of my role!\" \n\"So what were you working on this morning when I came in?\" \n\"Timing your pub visit to get the 10th pint from a fresh keg.\" \n\"WHAT?\" \n\"It's technical!\" I say. \"You wouldn't understand. Dave is the one who changes the kegs so when he's gone from the bar for more than 10 minutes – and he's not in the toilets – he's changing a keg. You don't want to try the stuff before then because it's often a dilute blend of lager and line cleaner – which is why the PFY and I usually drink bottled beer till you lot have had a few pints.\" \n\"WHAT?\" \n\"I told you it was technical.\" \n\"What about that domain stuff you were talking about?\" \n\"You mean all the geeky stuff? That's already in manuals. No need to reinvent that wheel. No, what I'm documenting is the important stuff that is critical to the smooth operation of the IT systems – like you asked. Which pizza places are open 24x7 and are happy to write you a receipt for 'office supplies' on their ghost company's letterhead. How to move all the clocks in the building 20 minutes backwards on a Monday morning and 40 minutes forward later that afternoon. How the lock on the pivoting windows can be adjusted so the window flips open the moment someone leans on it.\" \n\"That's not a thing.\" \n\"Sure it is. So is changing the acceleration\/deceleration curves on the lifts; tinkering with the heat and humidity settings on a single aircon unit for a 20-minute period to make the annoying woman in accounts receivable think she's going through menopause; making the maglock release times just a bit longer so people never know exactly how long the door will take to release, etc.\" \n\"That's not useful information.\" \n\"Of course it is. Why do you think you keep crashing into the door when you're carrying a scalding hot coffee?\" \n>slam< \n... the next day... \nSo the Boss is in a foul mood about the whole documentation thing and as a result he's punishing the PFY and me by making us attend a meeting with several of his grizzled ex-workmates from his former life in IT sales with a view to putting our latest server project their way... \nAs you'd expect, it's a collection of 30+-year-old war stories from 60+-year-old sales types who know more about the bottom of a gin bottle than any computer made in the last 25 years. \n\"... but it didn't matter BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO LOG IN ANYWAY!!!\" one of them blurts to the amusement of the others. \n\"Wow,\" the PFY says. \"You guys have some great stories. Wish I was a degenerate alcoholic.\" \n\"Now then,\" the Boss says in calm tones. \"They were different times.\" \n\"Yes, so much changed after the industrial revolution,\" the PFY adds drily. \nTo be fair, the PFY has a point. The meeting has been a blend of the kind of misogyny and racism you'd expect from a major political leader rather than someone who lives in the 21st century. \n\"Anyway,\" the Boss says, \"the chaps are excited to hear about this project we have coming up. So if you could just outline it for them.\" \n\"Outline which bit – the basic idea,\" the PFY says, pausing for effect, \"or the technical detail?\" \n\"The TECHNICAL detail,\" the Boss seethes. \n\"I'll just go get the crayons then,\" I say, stepping out of the meeting for a moment. Or 100. \n"}

Roll the Endless Requests for Further Information protocol","Link":"\/2018\/12\/07\/bofh_2018_episode_12\/","Content":"Episode 12 \"I just want to check the state of a job,\" the Boss says, burbling away on the PFY's hands-free. \n\"A support call?\" the PFY says. \"It'll be in the system.\" \n\"I know it's in the system,\" the Boss snaps back. \"It's got a job number. What I WANT to know is the state of the job.\" \n\"It's in the system,\" the PFY repeats. \"That's the state.\" \n\"No, I want to know what you're doing about it.\" \n\"Well, nothing,\" the PFY says, as if to a simpleton. \"It's in the system.\" \n\"So if it's in the system you... do nothing... about it?\" \n\"We do ERFIs, obviously,\" I say. \"The system takes care of the rest.\" \n\"ERFIs?\" \n\"Endless Requests for Further Information.\" \n\"Further Information?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Yeah, you know: What Operating System are you running? Have you tried a reboot? What version of the software do you have? What patch level? How much RAM is in your computer...\" I say. \n\"What happens if you run the app in safe mode?\" the PFY adds. \"Was there an error message? How long does it take to fail?\" \n\"So you ask them all those questions?\" \n\"Yes,\" I say. \"Not all at once of course. No, you can string a problem like that out over several weeks if you play your cards right.\" \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"Meaning always ask the questions last thing in the evening and then go home. That's one working day turnaround for each question.\" \n\"What if they give you all the information in the call?\" \n\"They can't – the helpdesk software now only has a 200-character problem data field. Besides, they can't give us all the information because we can make up questions they don't know the answer to, like: Have any of the Group Policies that apply to you been changed?\" \n\"Surely YOU would know that?\" \n\"We'd establish that fact tomorrow, moments before I ask them if they know their Active Directory ID.\" \n\"So... you're actively trying to AVOID solving problems?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Of course!\" the PFY says, rolling his eyes. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because the longer you drag out a fix the lower your ranking in the helpdesk software. The lower the ranking, the fewer jobs you get assigned. At present the PFY and I are only one point behind the bloke that pumps out the grease trap in the cafeteria – and he only comes on site every three months! He made the mistake of telling one of the staff to reboot the cash register when it wouldn't work.\" \n\"Why don't you want to answer calls?\" \n\"The more calls you resolve, the more calls you get.\" \n\"Well, what about this job?\" \n\"Like we said. It's in the system.\" \n\"We've established that,\" the Boss counters drily. \n\"No, it's not in the helpdesk system, it's in THE system. There's a stub in the helpdesk system but the rest of the job is in THE system.\" \n\"What's THE system?\" \n\"Well,\" the PFY says, looking around furtively. \"You know those early computer Eliza programs?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"They're an example of natural language processing. The basic idea is that you think you're talking to a real person but in reality you're talking to a program which will just solicit information without ever reaching an outcome.\" \n\"But it does sound interested,\" I add. \n\"Yes,\" the PFY continues. So we get an emailed problem from the helpdesk system which is directed into THE system. THE system will grab the job number and reply to the user via the helpdesk system, typically triggering an ERFI, which will be answered through the helpdesk system. \n\"Back and forth it will go until the user does one of four things: Sends an email out of the blue without the job number in the subject line (which will open a new job and close and expunge any previous similar job by the same person, restarting the ERFI process again). Ring us (which does nothing because we don't answer the phone). Ring you (which does nothing because the job's in the system). Complains to someone higher up the food chain – which we normally counter by showing that they have failed to supply all the information. After which we 'review the call in detail' – which can't be done while the job is open – expunge the job – to prevent any job duplication issues – and open a new call.\" \n\"But what we're really waiting for is the abuse.\" \n\"The what now?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The abuse. When they finally crack because it looks like no matter how many questions they answer they will never get the solution to their problem. When that happens we trigger the workplace harassment process off and because we're an involved party we are no longer able to work on that user's problems.\" \n\"It's a pretty sweet arrangement,\" the PFY says. \"I may need to go on stress leave soon.\" \n\"Because of the harassment,\" I add. \n\"Look,\" the Boss sighs, \"I just want to know where this job is at.\" \n\"Well, I suppose we could track it for you?\" \n\"That would be great.\" \n\"OK, so if you just send us an email with the job information,\" the PFY says. \n\"Including the serial number of your PC, keyboard and mouse,\" I add. \n\"And your car registration number,\" the PFY continues. \"To... THE system at >SLAM!< Oh, he's hung up. So I guess...\" \n\"We file it as Waiting on Further Information.\" \n\"Perfect.\" ® \n"}

I thought you were talking about wallpapering.\" \n\"Wallpapering? Why would I be talking about wallpapering? I don't know the first thing about wallpapering!\" \n\"That doesn't stop you talking about IT though does it?\" the PFY chips back. \nThe Boss chooses to ignore him. \n\"We getting to a point where there's not enough room for the staff we have.\" \n\"Surely, with the number of 'digital natives' in the company there'd be less need for support?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, but we're doing different work now than we used to. In the past IT was all about the hardware and the development but now we're more closely involved in the business process and the needs-use analysis.\" \n\"Oh, you mean stuff that means nothing,\" the PFY says. \n\"Couldn't you just cull the deadwood?\" I ask. \n\"Meaning?\" the Boss says defensively. \n\"The three consultants nearest us for a start – they hardly work at all. The bloke in the corner office spends all his time talking about his weight programme and BMI, the woman in the middle office bangs on about her daughter's latest diet fad and the bloke in the end office wanders all over the building telling people what disease he thinks he has.\" \n\"I don't really thin-\" \n\"If you give Charles Atlas, Gluten Gabber and Marco Polio the bum's rush you could knock out some walls and have a nice big open space that you could cram people into like sardines.\" \nBut of course that's not going to happen – because when it comes to real estate the first place they head for is the server and comms rooms. \nBecause there's only two people left to defend them... \n. . . \nSo the Boss isn't happy. It turns out the PFY's attempts to encourage the changes we'd proposed have not been met with the good humour we'd expected. \n\"I only asked if she'd had a baby,\" the PFY says, when responding to a chance complaint about the aforementioned woman's daughter. \n\"FOR BREAKFAST!\" the Boss snaps back angrily. \"You'd asked if she'd had a baby for breakfast.\" \n\"Did I?\" the PFY counters. \n\"Then you called Jim an arsehole.\" \nI didn't call him an arsehole, \" the PFY says defensively. \" I said he was more like a semicolon. \n\"AND THEN YOU TOLD BRIAN THAT HIS OFFICE WAS BEING TAKEN TO PIECES BECAUSE OF THE ASBESTOS PROBLEM!\" \n\"Who can be certain what has asbestos in it any more?\" the PFY replies. \n\"WE CAN! We only built those offices six years ago!\" \n\"But can you be SURE? Asbestos could be anywhere.\" \n\"YES!\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"YES!\" \n\"So you're sure that if we got a guy in to do testing he wouldn't find worryingly high levels of blue asbestos in the building?\" \n\"Of course he wouldn't!\" \n\"Are you sure?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"I'm not so sure. In fact I'm fairly certain that a bloke on minimum wage in a dull and monotonous job would find dangerously high levels of asbestos scant moments after finding a brown envelope stuffed with cash – a lot less cash than we might spend renovating a server room space.\" \n\"Are you proposing that we fake an asbestos panic just to get a couple of people to quit the company?\" \n\"Listen,\" I say, \"are you familiar with the idea of a Tripping Point?\" \n\"You mean The Tipping Point – a book by Malcolm Gladwell,\" the Boss nods knowingly, \"where he talks about things reaching a point at which a sudden large change occurs. And by that I assume you're suggesting that the office will get more and more crowded until such time that it's massively overcrowded and we'll actually fix the situation?\" \n\"No, I'm talking about the Tripping point, written by us, where I talk about how a middle manager will become increasingly annoying until he has a tragic staircase accident.\" \n\"We could name a chapter of the book after you if you like,\" the PFY says. \"Posthumously.\" \n. . . \n\"I can't believe it!\" I cry. \"And we've been breathing this in for months!\" \n\"Years even,\" the PFY responds. \n\"Someone should do something,\" the Boss adds. \n\"I think I'm having trouble breathing.\" \n\"Oh look, I think Marco's fainted.\" \n"}

Ah.

Ohhhh, maybe you could make the slide end up on a couch!!!!\" \n\"Ah no. We... are thinking about making the workplace a more enjoyable and healthy place to be – so that people like to come here.\" \n\"And the slide and couch and ice cream wouldn't do that?? So what ARE we proposing?\" \n\"I've heard good things about fruit baskets,\" Cath says. \"A fruit basket in every department – weekly – would mean that people got a better balance of vitamin C. And it provides a centre for people to interact socially.\" \n\"You could be right – there's something about rotting bananas that really brings people together. What are your thoughts, Sharon?\" \n\"I'm thinking free gym memberships for all staff – or even better, converting some unused office space into a gym!\" \n\"I like the way you think. We could use GYM signs because they'd be cheaper to print than KEEP OUT.\" \n\"I don't follow.\" \n\"When was the last time YOU went to the gym?\" \n\"Well, I... if there were one in the building...\" \n\"Exactly, never. They're like kryptonite to non-poseurs.\" \n\"MY suggestion,\" Doug says, \"is we use the 'nudge' theory to adopt positive changes – like addressing unhealthy eating patterns.\" \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"Well, we should remove desserts from the company lunches for a start.\" \n>SLAP!< \n\"I'm sorry,\" the PFY says. \"I think I've overdosed on my dandruff medication.\" \nDoug is a little stunned so I step in. \n\"So it's the sugar – and I guess type-2 diabetes – that you're worried about?\" \n\"Yes, but not just sugars – also salts and fats. We should definitely cancel the monthly Onion Bhaji Day.\" \n>SLAP!< \n\"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"I accidentally took some of the PFY's medication this morning.\" \n\"I think we might be getting a little off track here,\" the Boss says. \"But what are you saying?\" \n\"That your proposals are liable to be wildly unpopular...\" \nNow the Boss may not be the sharpest fork in the toaster, but even HE knows that these ideas are about as appetising as faecal transplant pizza and so he makes himself scarce. \n*** \nDoug, Sharon, Cath and Mike go on to implement their plans with the backing of HR – plans which only take about three hours to get round the building. \n\"Great day for a lynching!\" I say to the head of HR as the four Wellness gurus cower in his office. \n\"But it was a positive workplace move!\" Doug whines. \n\"No, a positive workplace move would be to give people 50 quid for making it in on time.\" \n\"A positive workplace move would be to sling a plank out your window and send these four out for a long walk,\" the PFY says. \n\"But people want to feel better about themselves,\" Mike says. \n\"No they don't – they want to distract their attention from the endless soul-destroying monotony of doing the same mundane task day after day – a task which probably doesn't need doing in the first place. They want ice cream, and slides, couches and onion bhajis.\" \n\"So... what do we do?\" the head of HR asks, looking out his door nervously at the seeds of rebellion in his department. \n\"1. Cut a hole in between the 3rd and 4th floor, install a slide with a couch at the end of it, and order an ice cream fridge. 2. Email the staff to say the previous message was a misunderstanding because you're implementing a monthly KEBAB Day, but it wasn't supposed to replace Onion Bhaji Day and the first Kebab Day is tomorrow when we unveil the slide, couch and ice cream project, etc.\" \n\"And that will calm people down?\" \n\"Maybe. I'd make it a bit of a PR thing – have some giveaways, probably send these four down the slide first and slap them in the face with a cream pie to show what good sports they are...\" \n\"Or a shepherds pie!\" the PFY adds unkindly. \n. . . The next day . . . \nThe wellness circus has begun. The head of HR and the gang of four have taken full credit for Kebab Day, the slide, ice cream, frisbees, etc and have left the actual construction and associated contractor goat-herding to the PFY and myself – even though none of this is in any way related to IT. \nThe five of them are upstairs doing a ceremonial ribbon-cutting exercise while the PFY and I are downstairs with the plebs. \n\"I feel,\" the PFY says, holding his hand to his forehead in the manner of a fortune teller, \"that this slide is a white elephant and will never be used after today.\" \n\"I can almost guarantee it,\" I say, as Mike whistles down the slide – which pivots 90˚ under my shoe pressure to point out the window. \n\"Can anyone else sense a shifting in the morale?\" I ask as the sound of a thud closely followed by the wail of Mike's car alarm reaches our ears from below. \n* Not that sad Bono – but rather the \"lateral thinking\" guy who reheated the 1953 concept of brainstorming . \n"}

Medical reasons that turned out to be IBS – and not the real IBS either. That said, the PFY's demonstration of his \"inflammable\" bowel syndrome is something the building's still talking about – long after the Boss's eyebrows grew back. \n\"So what's left to be done?\" I ask. \n\"Well,\" Philip says, \"the app is pretty much all there on the iOS and Android platforms; I just need to do a little tweaking on the screen models and the notification scheduling then I'll start work on the backend.\" \n\"So we currently have...\" \n\"The app. Mostly,\" Philip says. \nI feel the pink mist descending on me and notice a very prominent vein in the PFY's forehead at the same time. I look to the Boss and his Adam's apple is going down and up faster than cake at a bulimia dinner so I can tell he too is thinking about how much money we've wasted paying Philip to create something with all the functionality of a static web page. \n\"So.

Take?\" the Boss chokes out. \n\"Oh, a month or two, I'd expect,\" Philip says. \"There were a lot of changes to the app which pushed the development out quite a bit.\" \n\"My fault,\" the Director blurts. \"I gave him a couple of pointers on font selection and colours.\" \n\"And there was some other stuff too,\" Philip says. \n\"Yes, well, my wife had a couple of suggestions.\" \n\"Not using orange on black and limiting the number of fonts to two,\" Philip adds. \n\"And that took more than a year?\" \n\"Well, I needed to do a couple of complete rewrites when I changed from C++ to C# and then back to C++ – for functionality.\" \n\"WHAT BLOODY FUNCTIONALITY?!\" the PFY cracks. \"THERE'S NO BLOODY FUNCTIONALITY! IT'S NO MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN A PIECE OF PAPER!\" \n\"I... think that's a little inaccurate,\" the Director says calmly. \n\"He's right,\" I say to the PFY, nodding to the Director, \"because at least you can wipe your arse with a piece of paper – and paper knows what to do with a backend.\" \n\"It's just a backend issue, it shouldn't take too long.\" \n\"So you've looked at the backend?\" I ask. \n\"No, but...\" \n\"Do you even know what the backend is?\" \n\"No, but..\" \n\"Do you know what a backend is?\" the PFY asks. \n\"It's the database,\" Philip says drily. \n\"Could be a database, could be a mail system, could be a API or even a physical interface. Do you know which one you're using?\" \n\"Well, I'm not too sure what I'm going to be reporting on just yet, but the client is fully functional.\" \n\"HOW CAN IT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING TO?!\" the PFY rages. \n\"It's just an interface,\" Philip burbles. \"I'll just massage the input into a format that matches the outputs on my app.\" \n\"What are the outputs on your app?\" I ask. \n\"It's a dashboard traffic light, with Green being Normal, Orange being Warning and Red meaning Critical.\" \n\"Are there any inputs in your app?\" \n\"Of course, there's swipe down to refresh and a reset button.\" \n\"What does the reset button do?\" \n\"At the moment it just clears the screen and does a refresh – but in the future it'll clear the screen, resync the data at the other end and then refresh.\" \n\"And by resync you mean refresh?\" \n\"Well, yes.\" \n\"So let me get this straight,\" the Boss says, pressing a thumb to his eyesocket as he contemplates the low-tech wall that his entire development budget has been pissed up against. \n>updown< >updown< >updown< \n\"We've paid you to make an App – on a phone, with three different coloured words...\" .... >updown< >updown< >updown< ... \"and ONE input – that doesn't actually talk to anything at the other end yet?\" \n\"Well, no one's told me what's on the other end yet,\" Philip says defensively. \n\"Have they not?\" the Boss asks, finally understanding the problem. \n\"Well, it's right over here.\" \n\"Where?\" the Director asks. \n\"Over here...\" the Boss says, looking pointedly at the PFY and myself. \n\"... by the window.\" \n"}

No: I hate old computers which have some non-standard config – like most old computers. \nYou know, when you have to boot the company's ancient financials system (which has been sitting, OFF, for so long that it has a layer of dust littered with coffee rings and cigarette burns) so an auditor can check back to *2004* to see what price we paid for 24\/6 size staples because they suspect we misattributed the costs to the wrong cost centre and if THAT'S the case then it's potentially indicative of a blasé attitude towards cost management – which could seriously affect the ongoing commercial viability of the company, etc, etc. \nObviously this is the sort of financial problem that is usually sorted out when there's a big concrete pour scheduled at a nearby building site with shockingly lax after-hours security. However, auditors are like cockroaches and there's always another one behind the fridge waiting to make themselves known. \nWe boot the server to find there's something up with the RAID array because the unit has been powered off so long that the standby battery has become more of a lie-down battery. \n\"Isn't the RAID config stored in a sector on the disk?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes but it wants an address from 00 to FF.\" \n\"00 – the default.\" \n\"Bound to be!\" \n\"Uh-oh,\" the PFY says, looking at the volume information. \n\"Indeed,\" I say, looking at the two failed drives in the array. \nNow waaaaay back in the day, a bad drive used to mean an overnight tape recovery session – but then RAID-5 came along. Even though it had the write speed of a blind scribe with Parkinson's and prostate problems, it was reasonably reliable – until you lose two disks. \n\"Reboot,\" I say to the PFY. \n>Click< >BEEEEEEEP< >SMACK< >Whirrr< \n\"What the hell are you doing?!\" the Boss gasps, coming into the room for a staple update. \n\"Stiction,\" I say. \n\"ONE failed drive,\" the PFY says moments later when the RAID config shows. \"Hot swap?\" \n\"Going to have to be. Now all we need is a 160Gig... oh... SCSI... drive.\" \nNGGGGGAAAARGH! \n... \nTwo days later we have a replacement drive – the major component of the cost being the shipping – and the disk gets replaced. Our next problem is the operating system, because no one can remember what the bloody admin password was back then. \nA reboot and password zero later we find the machine is part of our old domain and needs domain credentials to start the database. \nA trip to the Storeroom of Doom later and we have an ancient domain controller which, after booting, complains about a missing BDC but limps along in an about-to-die manner regardless. We then find out the licence for the financials software expired in 2005, so a couple of clock resets later we're back in 2004 and resetting the domain passwords and starting the financials system. All that's left now is to find a desktop machine from the beginning of time that has the financials client installed on it... \n... \n\"I told you we should have virtualized everything,\" the PFY says. \n\"Maybe so,\" I say, hefting a fancy \"dual-core\" desktop machine from the store onto the desk, \"but hoarding pays off in the end.\" \n... \n\"Is it done?\" the auditor asks, entering Mission Control with the Boss. \n\"Probably,\" I say. \"We have one of the original client machines, the original server and original domain controller all plugged into a cheap eight-port switch. With any luck you should be able to login with these credentials. >scribble<.\" \n>tappity< >tap< >tap< >click> \n>tap< >click< \n\"Well... I'll just leave you to it then?\" the Boss asks, quickly bored with watching someone negotiating an aeons-old chart of accounts. \n\"Uh-huh,\" the auditor says distractedly as the Boss wanders away. \n>tap< >tappity< >tap< \n\"Hmmm,\" he says a few moments later. \n\"Hmm?\" I ask. \n\"Have you made any changes to this?\" \n\"You mean apart from resetting some ancient passwords and replacing a hard drive?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes. No: I mean have you changed the data?\" \n\"I shouldn't have thought so,\" I chip back. \"It should be in the same state as when it was switched off years ago. An orderly shutdown, most likely, and the disk replacement was like-for-like in a hot-swap RAID set, so that should have been OK too. Why?\" \n\"It's just the data,\" he says. \"According to this,\" he says, pointing at a row in a table, \"back in 2004 the IT department spent almost £3,000 on staples – and the supplier name is 'The Blue Posts'.\" \n\"Oh yes!\" I say. \"Blue Posts office and stationery. They closed down in 2005 and the new tenants put a pub up in its place – and named it after the stationery shop.\" \n\"Really?\" he says, with a just a hint of absolute disbelief. \n\"Yes, they even have photographs in the front bar of the old stationery shop when it was running.\" \n\"And where is this pub?\" he asks. \n\"It's only a couple of streets away.\" \n\"I think I'll need to verify this for myself,\" he says – again with that hint... \n\"No problems, we can shoot down there tonight, it's just past that new building they're starting to put up...\" \n"}

Well, the wires are. The computer's relatively new in comparison – probably mid-to-late '80s. A DOS PC with 128k of RAM, an ST225 hard drive and a VERY proprietary ISA card. That mass of cables talks to the card and the card talks back. When it's going the green light is on, when it's not, the shit hits the fan. And I mean it when I use the words shit and fan.\" \n\"Red,\" the PFY says, standing up from his crouched position. \"No, green.\" \n\"So bicycle clip time,\" I say. \n\"What does it do?\" \n\"It modulates the fresh air fans in the building based on the readings from archaic CO 2 sensors on each floor. It operates the condensate sump purge valves which empty all the condensed body fluids from the air conditioning systems on each floor into the condensate riser pipes on the wall over there. It pumps the condensate riser into the sewer sump and it operates the macerating pump in the sewer sump which discharges the building waste up the rising main to the council sewer,\" the PFY says. \n\"It also operates all the interlocks for fire alarms to tell the lift to return to ground, fresh air fans to turn off and magnetic door holdbacks to release. It probably does a bunch of other stuff, but today's problem is the PC. If it's not running soon there will be bigger problems.\" \n\"Can you fix it?\" the Boss asks nervously, no doubt suppressing the urge to dash the 50 or so steps to his car and get out of dodge till it all blows over. So to speak. \n\"No.\" \n\"NO!?\" he says, casually patting his trouser pocket to make sure he has his car keys with him. \n\"No,\" the PFY says reluctantly. \"But… we know someone who can. Though it'll be costly.\" \n\"Costly?\" \n\"Yep. An old bloke who simply loves old PCs. A hoarder type who could tell you the pinouts of an RLL controller from memory – if he could spare the time away from discussing the merits of PC-DOS versus MS-DOS.\" \n\"How much time do we have?\" \n\"For what?\" \n\"Until, you know, it happens?\" \n\"You mean until the condensate stacks back up so much the pressure knocks the cap off our waste pipe again and\/or backs up into the fresh air ducting? Maybe three to four hours.\" \n\"Get him in!\" \nTwo hours later, our man is in the basement looking at the kit. \n\"Beautiful design,\" he says, spotting the card in the machine. \n\"Yes, that's what you said when you came five years ago,\" the PFY says. \"Can you fix it?\" \n\"No,\" he says. \"But I can replace it.\" \n\"Ah,\" the Boss sighs. \"Now?\" \n\"No, I will have to go back home.\" \nNow this guy is one of those highly strung types – no doubt with a short fuse, a bedroom full of ancient PC gear and a back garden full of the bodies of the schoolmates that looked at him funny, so we want to keep on his good side. \n\"The Boss will drive you as we're in a bit of a hurry,\" the PFY says, angling for the two-birds-with-one-stone murder-suicide plan. \nForty minutes later, they're back and the Boss is rather subdued – likely having sat through a 35-minute monologue on how 1.44 megabytes is the computing equivalent of crossing the streams. However, the green light is on, there's a rhythmic thumping noise from the floor of the basement and the air has lost that tangy taste. \nI'd call that a win. \nOur man scratches out a bill on an ancient invoice pad and hands it to the PFY. \n\"Thanks very much,\" the PFY says, pocketing the invoice. \n\"How much was it?\" the Boss asks as we ride the lift back up to Mission Control. \n\"Three-and-a-half grand.\" \n\"POUNDS!?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It was a bargain,\" I say. \"Those cards are almost impossible to find, and they typically run for five to eight years, so just call it 500 quid a year.\" \n\"I'm not authorising that!\" he snaps. \n\"It's just a few grand,\" I say. \"We'd need to find another card.\" \n\"We'll look on eBay!\" he says, pushing the B2 button on the lift. \n…Five minutes later… \n\"Now I've had the PFY pop upstairs to get the approvals form, and we'll slip that under the door to you,\" I shout. \n\"When you've signed it, slip it back and we'll take it up to payments and get them to cut a cheque – if they still have a chequebook. Then – and only then – I'll flip the breaker to turn the PC back on.\" \n\"You won't get away with this!\" \n\"You see those holes in the condensate pipes about ceiling level?\" I ask. \"They made us put them in after the last time. That's where the condensate overflow comes out. Only if the macerating pump is off for too long, it won't be just condensate that comes out. I don't want to rush you but you might want to consider the post-lunchtime rush on the toilets.\" \nBarely a minute later the PFY had returned, the form had been signed and he went off off to take payment. \nI feel a little bad about breaking the key off in the padlock now.  Even more so, considering it's the switchboard key too. \n"}

I did call the locksmith before I did it, though.\" \n\"Was breaking the key off really necessary?\" the CEO asks. \n\"If we wanted a comprehensive report on the company's DR capabilities without the interference of others, yes.\" \n\"And then you left the building?\" \n\" I did,\" I respond, \"while my assistant here ran things from the office.\" \n\"With the door locked and desks piled up against it,\" the Director says. \n\"Terrorist action could well be one of the disasters we were planning for,\" the PFY burbles. \n\"And so we had a DR system no one could get to because none of their machines had power?\" \n\"The auditor's brief for DR and Business Continuity was to focus on core systems, which were all intact. In some ways it was the perfect outage,\" I say. \"The company website was completely unaffected and phones failed over to the off-site call centre service.\" \n\"And you didn't think to run your plan by anyone?\" \n\"We considered it, but it's not much of a disaster if everyone knows when it's happening,\" the PFY responds, nodding slowly. \n\"He's right,\" I say. \"You can see that every time there's fire drill – everyone heads straight to the pub 10 minutes before the alarm.\" \n\"And that would be why the fire alarms went off at the same time?\" the CEO asks. \n\"Terrorism has no respect for safety...\" I say. \n\"BY SETTING FIRE TO MY CAR!\" the Director snaps. \n\"... or property,\" I add. \n\"I see,\" the Director says. \"And what was the point behind beating the car with golf clubs prior to setting it on fire?\" \n\"I believe it was some form of angry mob simulation,\" The PFY says. \"You know Extinction Rebellion protests, that sort of thing. I understand that's why the culprits – whoever they were – were wearing masks. It may even have been some real terrorists – we may never know.\" \n\"Did we not have camera footage?\" \n\"Sadly the camera footage went out with the power,\" I say, \"one of the learnings of this whole incident. It seems that the power point in Security labelled 'UPS' was not in fact a UPS power point, which is why all the secure doors released.\" \n\"Which explains how someone managed to empty the boardroom drinks cabinet,\" the CEO says drily. \"Did we get any other concrete learnings from this exercise?\" \n\"We have compiled a list of valuable learnings based on our observations at the time, which we fed back to our management,\" I say, nodding at the Boss and Director. \"There's the mislabelling of the UPS outlets in Security that we've already mentioned, the locks failing for the same reason and the building being susceptible to fire alarm triggering from a burning vehicle outside the fresh air intake fan.\" \n\"We also noted,\" the PFY continues, \"and have passed on, that we need to lock down the company's Facebook page so that someone can't repeatedly post FIRE SALE pictures to it...\" \n\"Bloody terrorists,\" I chip in. \n\"... but I think the main lesson in all of this is that a DR test really needs to be done when people least expect it if you want to get realistic results that aren't skewed by foreknowledge.\" \n\"And so you'd claim that the whole exercise was a success?\" \n\"Not that one, no, but the next one is bound to show the efficiency of the management chain of command.\" \n\"And that would be happening when?\" the CEO asks, just as the power goes out and the fire alarms start. \n\"Right about now, I guess,\" the PFY says, turning to the Director. \"Bring the wife's car in today, did you?\" \n"}

What risk?\" \n\"Well, there's been several wind shear warnings this year which affects the cloud, probably due to global warming – though no one will admit to that. So we're just a bit cautious about putting too much of our critical infrastructure onto it. And of course there's the ozone layer thing.\" \n\"Yes, of course,\" he says, feigning understanding. \"Well, that's probably for the best. What about blockchain? Why aren't we doing anything in this space?\" \n\"Mainly vendor reliability,\" I say. \"There's been a lot of cheap imported blockchain on the market and apparently there are rust issues because of the poor quality galvanising. We're keeping an eye on it, but until we can guarantee reliability we're just a bit cautious.\" \n\"Virtual reality?\" \n\"We're living it already.\" \n\"Self-driving vehicles?\" \n\"What for?\" I ask. \n\"I don't know – can't you make a delivery cart to deliver things around the building?\" \n\"We COULD I guess, but it'd be costly – because of Cole's Law\" \n\"Cole's Law?\" \n\"Yes, people spill it in the cafeteria and it makes normal driving wheels slip.\" \n\"I... uh... drones?\" \n\"Again, what would we use them for?\" \n\"Artificial intelligence?\" \n\"For drones?\" \n\"No, I mean have we got any artificial intelligence?\" \n\"Outside of senior management? No.\" \n\"What about Internet of Things?\" \n\"That's what our users call eBay.\" \n\"Big data?\" \n\"We have that already. We converted all our 8-bit data to 16-bit.\" \n\"I... don't know what that means.\" \n\"Trust me, it's bigger. Twice the size.\" \n\"Eight more zeros,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Good, and how do we demonstrate that?\" \n\"The size of our database?\" the PFY asks. \n\"The size of our online storage bill?\" I chip in. \n\"What about nanotechnology?\" he asks, moving on. \n\"Apple discontinued them in 2017,\" I say. \n\"Oh. What about... uh... holograms!\" \n\"You could be speaking to one now!\" \n\"Am I?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Augmented reality?\" \n\"It's virtually the same as virtual reality.\" \n\"So pretty much everything I've suggested you've pooh-poohed or given me some excuse about why you can't do it,\" he shoots back. \n\"We're a fairly progressive company but we want to implement technology that will work and not fail inside a short period. You can't be too cautious with technology.\" \n\"Well, I've given you a stack of ideas and you've shot down every one. How about YOU suggest something to bring this company out of the dark ages?!\" \n\"Well... I dunno,\" the PFY says. \n\"And I'm not too sure that anything we've got would really showcase the company's technical excellence,\" I add. \n\"You MUST have something,\" he snaps. \"You're supposed to be the technical people! Don't you even have a robot or something?!\" \n\"No, no robots,\" the PFY says. \"They're very much in the developmental stages.\" \n\"Didn't one of my predecessors sign off a massive robot project?\" the Director asks. \n\"Yes, but we're still ironing out some of the teethin...\" \n\"How about we take a look at that then?\" he demands. \n\"Uh... we've had some issues with reliability,\" I say. \n\"You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs!\" \n\"Yeah but...\" \n\"So you're saying you squandered thousands and thousands of pounds of company money on a project that you just abandoned?\" \n\"Not abandoned per se,\" I say. \"We still have one of the prototypes locked away in the basement somewhere.\" \n\"Well, let's take a look at that then!\" \n\"Performance was a little 'choppy',\" the PFY warns. \n\"Nonsense. Let's just see how it goes – as a proof of concept, even if there is the old bug or two.\" \n\"OK, I guess so. How about we send it up to your office when everyone gets here?\" \n\"Perfect.

Not at this stage.\" \n\"So what you're saying is that IT is the only way for the company to address global warming at the moment - which therefore IMPLIES that IT must be to blame?\" \n\"Oh, I see your point. But no, that's not what I meant.\" \n\"If I might,\" I say, raising an index finger to interrupt the Director while addressing the PFY, \"climate change is increasingly being seen as the result of a flawed business model whereby the impact of a business process on the environment is not directly attributed to the business process and a cost penalty added. In other words, things which could in the past be abused for free are increasingly being factored into the business costs.. The server which consumes 1,200 watts of running power and maybe 1,250 watts of cooling power through some space time anomaly is seen as a global impact of some 2,450 watts of generation which has some carbon impact - depending on the generation involved.\" \n\"Yes. And not to mention the cost of manufacturing the server in the first place,\" the Director says. \n\"And to address this we are to make changes in the way we use servers to make a positive contribution?\" I ask. \n\"Exactly!\" the Boss says. \n\"Changes,\" I add, \"which would be dwarfed by those which could be had by, say, reducing the size of engines in corporate vehicles? Or unnecessary corporate air travel?\" \n\"Or removing the bean curry from the lunch menu,\" the PFY adds. \n\"I don't know about that but I do know that the company's electricity burden appears to be directly linked to IT.\" \n\"Though more linked to desktop IT than server IT,\" I suggest. \n\"I don't follow.\" \n\"Desktops are more wasteful than servers,\" the PFY chips in helpfully. \"Servers wind down when they're not in use, whereas desktops only sometimes wind down. An entire processor, fan and power supply is devoted to one user – whereas with a server the load is vastly smaller per use.\" \n\"But servers are on all the time!\" the Boss says. \"Three times as long as a desktop.\" \n\"But the servers are used by orders of magnitude more people, so on balance desktops are the high users.\" \nThere's no point in arguing with the Boss on this one though, he feels that he's atop some moral high ground and will not budge. \n\"So we're... going to do what?\" I ask. \n\"We're going to offset our carbon by buying carbon credits with our residual IT budget!\" he cries happily, \"which will make a fantastic piece for our annual report.\" \n\"How we wasted money on carbon credits paying someone to plant some trees?\" \n\"It's not a waste.\" \n\"I'm not so sure. Buying carbon credits is a bit like a serial killer paying someone else to have kids to make his activity cost neutral.\" \n\"I...\" the Boss says \n\" What about if we identified a way to prevent some pollution and used that to offset our carbon – so we found a way to make up for it?\" \n\"I'm listening\" the Boss says. \"So you're proposing to not cause some pollution and use that as an offset?\" \n\"Yes. We don't need to put our money into any overseas collective and at the same time we effectively keep our I.T. Budget in house but achieve the same carbon savings.\" \n\"So what pollution were you thinking of preventing?\" \n\"I was thinking of setting the building on fire. So if I don't do that, then it'll save a massive amount of pollution but also we could deal with the whole carbon credit thing in house as it were – win\/win!\" \n\"So I'll be paying you not to burn our building down?\" the Boss says. \n\"I'm sure the board will be pleased – particularly if there's a board meeting on at the time. I'm sure that would meet their targets.\" \n\"What targets?\" \n\"The carbon targets.\" \n\"Oh they don't have any targets – this is just one of our initiatives. And I am not going to propose your solution.\" \n\"OK, OK – I see that it's a matter of personal importance to you. What about if what I didn't burn was a car?. What if it was your car. What are the credits on not setting that on fire? And if you happened to be in it at the time and all that polyester went up as well... That wouldn't be ecological.\" \n\"Are you insane?\" \n\"You would have to ask my defence counsel about that.\" \n\"But we have to give a presentation to the board tomorrow!\" \n\"You could always set the building on fire.\" \nThe Boss gasps, but I raise a calming hand. \n\"Nothing excessive, just set fire to a couple of sheets of A4 paper in your office bin just before the meeting, wait for the sensor to trip the alarm, put it out with the extinguisher and then when everyone's back inside say you can't make the meeting because you need to look into some flammable battery issues.\" \n\"You think that will work?\" \n\"Of course.\" \nSo the Boss wanders off to plan his arson and the status quo has returned to normal. \n\"Can you do me a favour?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"Sure.\" \n\"Swap the extinguisher outside the Boss's office for the one with petrol in it will you?\" \n\"Or should I use water,\" the PFY says, \"then we could claim those not-burning-the-building-down credits?\" \nNow that's a dilemma. \n"}

They're dull as dishwater.

Or pay the... er, five grand they’re asking.” \n“Forensics has a two-week turnaround and we don’t have that kind of cash.” \n“Hmmm,” I say. “When do you need it?” \n“3pm.” \n“No chance.” \n“3:15?” \n“Dreaming.” \n“Look we need this by - ABSOLUTE LATEST – 3:30pm.” \n“Can’t be done.” \n“OK, 3:45, but the data would need to be transmitted immediately.” \n“Okay then,” I say. “I’ll need to boot the system with some forensics fingerprinting software...” \n>whirrrrrrr< \n“And now just a low level scan.” \n“Well, what do you see?” the Director asks nervously. \n“Coloured boxes - this isn’t CSI-Fantasyland! It can take YEARS to decrypt an index off a disk. Though the software says this ransomware uses a crackable rolling encryption algorithm.” \n“What’s that mean?” \n“It means that it encrypts bits of the disk with different keys but you can crack them one at a time.” \n“The problem is this bit,” I say, pointing at the screen. “There’s a whole bunch of Unknown file types. It means the encryption hasn’t cracked that bit, and if your file – or part of it – is in that location then the file will be corrupt.” \n“Can you see any files?” the Director asks. \n“Stacks!” I reply. “But we’ll run out time if we try them all. We need a file name.” \n“OK,” the Director says nervously. “It’s an encrypted Excel file. Do you know what that looks like?” \n“Yes, like an Excel file.” \n“No, it’s an encrypted excel file. BNKXFER.” \n“Right!” >clickety< \n“This wouldn’t be an end of year bonus upload file – which no one's getting this year – would it? If it were it’d just be a file of account numbers and account names with zero in the third column.” \n“I don’t know what it is,” the Director lies. “It’s encrypted.” \n“Okay, I think I can see some files like that. Do you have a Class 10 USB-3 key on you with hardware encryption?” \n“Uhhhh. No.” \n“Right,” I say. “Just a minute, I might have one in my drawer.” >shuffle< “There.” \n>clicky< \n“OK.

The... uh... bank said so.” \n“OK,” I say. “Maybe a different version will work.” >clickety< “Try that.” \n>slam< \n“Why are you helping him?” the PFY demands. \n“Why am I copying random chunks of garbled filesystem to BNKXFER.XLSM on the USB stick?” I ask. “Because it amuses me.” \n“Still nothing,” the Director says, bumbling headlong through the door to Mission Control at speed. \n“Okay, I’ll just try another version.” >clicky< I say, watching the clock creep around to the 3:10 mark. \n>DASH!< \n“How long are you going to keep this up?” the PFY asks. \n“Did you know,” I ask, “that our bank actually stops processing electronic transfers at 4pm sharp. After that they’ll hold them all over till the third of January.

All you need to be part of this deal is a non-refundable £50k deposit followed by a second £50k instalment once the development is out of the ground. Only you don’t have £50k on hand just at the moment, let alone £100k.

And somehow it gets infected with ransomware...” \n“You didn’t!” \n>clonk< \n>stumble< \n“The thing is,” I say to the Director. “I’m supposed to be having an end of work drinks. But instead I’m pretty much pulling overtime.” \n“Just claim it!” he gasps, handing my key over one more time. \n“Yes, but the thing is, you know, all those taxes and everything. Cash would be... you know... better. A lot of cash.” \n“Don’t have any cash...” he wheezes. \n“If only we had cash in the building,” I say. “Somewhere that you could get to and be back from in... 10 minutes...” \n>stumble-dash< \n“So now,” I say to the PFY calmly. “You’ve all borrowed £50k for the first installment which you stand to lose if the second £50k isn’t paid to the developer by the end of business today. But the upload file was completely obliterated by the ransomware – though maybe someone took a copy of the file before the virus struck. Only that person didn’t know the password.” \n“Mmmm” \n“But they DO have a Class-10 USB stick with a key logger on it.” \n“Ah!” \n“And so they send you backwards and forwards with the key-logging USB stick recording the password that you told them you didn’t have...” \n“Yes...” \n“And then they send you out for cash while they: decrypt your file >clickety<; delete the six rows of account numbers, names and 50ks, >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack<; and insert a single row with the account name and number of the social club with a 300k third column, >paste< >tappity< >tap<; then reencrypt the file >clickety< >tap< just in time for you to...” \n>stumble< \n“Here!” the Director says, trying to hand over a wadge of cash. \n“Oh, how much is it?” \n“Dunno” he gasps. \n“Could you count it?” I ask. \n“NO!” the Director gasps. “I need the file NOW! \n“Okay, but you will bring the money back and count it?” \n>stumble-dash< \n“And so eventually you get your file – only you don’t get a chance to send it because when you get back to your office Security is waiting for you because they’ve finally found the person who’s been stealing all the petty cash money...” \n“I thought that was y...” \n“We know who it is because they’re on camera,” I interrupt. \n“And all that’s left to do is upload this file to the banking portal >drag< >clicky< and in the blink of an eye our six senior managers have lost £50k, and in two minutes the social club will have purchased a pub!” \nChristmas like Clockwork. \n"}

The Boss could have conceivably dropped the contract into any one of the snail mail boxes in the building or handed it off to someone's PA to send – which means we only have a couple of hours... \n\"We're just going to pop away for a moment...\" I say. \n… \n>beep!< \n… \n\"There he is!\" the PFY says cheerfully. \n>beep!< \n\"?\" the Boss says. \n\"How are you doing?\" I ask, ooooooooozing concern once more. \n>beep!< \n\"I'm Simon, this is Stephen, do you remember?\" \n>beep!< \nThe wary look in the Boss's bleary eyes tells me he's up with the play. \n\"You had an accident,\" the PFY explains loudly. \"A fall.\" \n>beep!< \n\"ngggggggrrrgh!\" the Boss responds, but that's probably because they had to wire his jaw. \n\"You fell,\" I say, repeating the PFY's comment. \"Probably because you were maybe concentrating on a contract that you misplaced.\" \n>beep!< \n\"ollllltaiss,\" the Boss gurgles, which might cause some people to think of the words \"oiled stairs\" – but not me. \n\"You want some chilli eye wash?\" I ask and the Boss clenches his eyes shut. \"No?\" \n\"This machine is reading some very funny numbers.

And so we're thinking that some way of getting a morale boost would be good,\" the Boss burbles. \n\"And cash was ruled out because?\" I ask. \n\"Money is a temporary thing...\" \n\"Much like morale in that respect,\" the PFY notes. \n\"The Director wants something longer term. Something less transient, less impersonal, less...\" \n\"Expensive?\" I suggest. \n\"Cost isn't an issue,\" the Boss snaps. \n\"No, it's just a coincidence that suggested improvements centre around the staff 'making their own fun'.\" \n\"The Directors come to the party!\" the Boss chirps. \n\"Doing a survey to find morale is at 18 per cent then printing posters with platitudes is not something I've seen at any party I've been to,\" I counter. \n\"It's not platitudes - it's the overarching idea,\" Philip says. \nPhilip is a consultant \nHe's also (a) a close relative of the IT director, (b) a toff, and (c) the product of so many generations of relentless inbreeding he probably has an ear growing out of one of his three armpits. The 10 years it took him to get a bachelors in Psychology - majoring in social cognition - has given him all the prerequisites for a career in the motor industry - as a speed bump - but otherwise he's virtually unemployable. \nWhich is where nepotism tends to help out. \n\"Which idea is that?\" I ask. \n\"The idea that whilst we're all individuals we're also connected by a common thread which makes us all part of the same humanity.\" \n\"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"I'll need a glass of water to wash the sick down. Meantime, how were you proposing that we'd identify this common thread?\" \n\"We just need to share more of ourselves.\" \n\"One of the advertising guys tried that a couple of years back,\" the PFY says: \"I think he's got about 18 months left to serve on his sentence.\" \n\"I'm talking about sharing your personal stories,\" Philip responds, ignoring the PFY. \"What you do outside of work, what your interests and passions are. Learning more about each other helps us work better together. For instance, I was talking to your Manager just this morning and he shared with me his pastime of magnet fishing. And you know what he's got from that?\" \n\"Priority calling at Samaritans?\" I ask. \n\"No, he's made many new friends!\" \n\"Friends at Samaritans,\" the PFY points out. \n\"He's also a musician!\" Philip blurts before the Boss can stop him. \"He's released a country music album.\" \n\"What was it called: 'You brought nothing to the party but a six pack of regret?'\" the PFY asks. \n\"I... think we should probably avoid that particular rabbit hole,\" I say, smelling quite a lot of blood in the water. \n\"We were talking about rabbit holes at Book Club last night\" the Boss burbles, forgetting our wolf-like tendencies when a slow animal is separated from the herd. \"We're reading Alice in Wonderland !\" \n\"And what's the first rule of book club?\" I ask. \n\"Don't talk about book club!\" the PFY proffers. \n\"Or any of your clubs,\" I add. \"If I want to feel sad I'll just ask you about your bucket list again.\" \n\"What's wrong with it?\" the Boss protests. \"There's plenty of interesting things on it - like learning to fly.\" \n\"The PFY could sort you out for that this afternoon,\" I say. \"A remarkably short lesson that will help you make your mark on the world. Or more accurately, the footpath.\" \n\"Philip suggested a progressive lunch,\" the Boss says, changing the subject before we can delve further into his private plummet licence. \n\"A what now?\" \n\"A progressive lunch: each department provides snacks and the rest of the company has a quick visit to see what they do – so we all understand each others' roles.\" \n\"After the laxative cake of 2012 no one's going to take snacks from us,\" the PFY points out. \"Still, if we kept visitor groups small...\" \n\"Yes! Exactly,\" Philip nods. \n. . . Three days later . . . \n\"Okay, so, in retrospect, I think we have some learnings from this,\" I say to the Boss. \"ONE: We should probably vet the images we pull from users' web caches. TWO: showing people the CCTV footage of their co-workers picking their noses in the lift does nothing for the perceived level of company hygiene.\" \n\"Nor – apparently – does showing them what happens on the reception desk on the occasional late Friday night after happy hour,\" the PFY adds. \n\"THREE,\" I continue, \"our staff are apparently unaware of the amount of low-level stalking that goes on in the building and do not necessarily welcome a GPS tracking replay showing them this.\" \n\"Regardless, the morale of the department seems to have improved to 39 per cent,\" the Boss says. \n\"Yes, there was a noticeable spike in morale after Philip slipped on the footpath and was hit by one of the company vans,\" I say. \n\"And you wouldn't know anything about that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No, but honestly, the odds of it happening were astronomical - like 1 to 1,000.\" \n\"You mean 1,000 to 1.\" \n\"No, 1 to 1,000.

It won't take more than five minutes to complete; it's just a set of multi-choice questions.\" \n\"Is there some reward or prize or something?\" he asks. \n\"Sure,\" the PFY says, rifling around the Boss's desktop. \"You will be in the draw to win a... iPhone... >scrabble< 11... uh... Pro.\" \n\"OK.\" \n\"So this is a satisfaction survey for the systems team. You rang for service yesterday and we'd like to survey you.\" \n\"I rang you to tell you that you'd left a screwdriver on my desk.\" \n\"And how would you rate our response to your request?\" \n\"It wasn't a request, I was just telling you that you left a screwdriver behind.\" \n\"And how would you rate our response – on a scale of Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon to Will Ferrell in Elf ?\" \n\"What does that even mean?\" \n\"Crazy angry to ecstatic.\" \n\"I don't know, somewhere in the middle.\" \n\"So the teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off ?\" \n\"I don't know what that means.\" \n\"Moving on – and considering only the speed of resolution of your call – how would you rate your satisfaction with our speed on a scale of Core 2 Duo to Ryzen 3950x?\" \n\"I don't know what that scale means.\" \n\"Slow or quick?\" \n\"Reasonably quick. But it was only...\" \n\"OK, I'm putting down i7 6700\" \n\"I don't know what that means.\" \n\"Moving right along, if this request resolution were a coffee cup, what coffee cup would it be – on a scale of 1 being a square cup which leaks out the corners to 5 being a perfectly shaped double-walled spill-proof travel mug?.\" \n\"Again, I...\" \n\"Was it a nightmare or did you get everything you wanted?\" \n\"Somewhere in the middle I guess,\" our Head Beanie says, resigning himself to the process. \n\"OK, how quickly did you receive your first response – on a scale of Mr Magoo's driving to faster than a speeding bullet?\" \n\"The middle,\" he says, forgoing the request for a translation as the will to live leaves him. \n...10 minutes later... \n\"Now,\" the PFY says. \"Based solely on your last experience, how likely is it that you would use our service again?\" \n\"What, you mean if you leave a screwdriver in my office again?\" \n\"... on a likelihood scale of the Moon landings were fake to the Sun will rise tomorrow morning?\" \n\"Uh...\" \nThe Head Beancounter has not been exposed to any of the PFY's conspiracy theories in the past so he's not too sure how to answer that one. \n\"OK, thank you very much for your time,\" I say, hanging up before the PFY can launch into a discussion of Van Allen belts and flag fluttering. \n\"Well, I think that went well,\" the PFY says. \n\"Yes, but we've hardly created a body of data have we?\" I reply. \n\"True,\" the PFY says. \n>Redial< \n\"Yes?\" the Head Beancounter says. \n\"Hi, I was wondering if you had time to do a client survey?\" the PFY asks. \n\"We just did that.\" \n\"Yes, but that was about yesterday's call. I'm talking about the call we just had – again putting you in the draw for that iPhone.\" \n... Six more calls and 25 minutes later... \n\"It seems,\" I say to the Boss when he returns, \"that our clients have a fairly positive reaction to us, but that the more interaction we have with them the less satisfied they appear to be. It's as if surveys actually irritated people rather than made them feel like their needs were being heard.\" \n\"Still, though, I think there's value in listening to what users have to say. Did they have any suggestions?\" \n\"The Head Beancounter suggested we never call him again. I think he may have ripped his phone out of the wall,\" the PFY says. \n\"And we're probably going to have to go up there and fix that later,\" I add. \"And survey how he felt the fix went. Perhaps we should create a list of people that we don't consider to be surveyable clients?\" \n\"What?\" the Boss asks sarcastically. \"And add the names of every dissatisfied person in the building?\" \n\"I'm just suggesting that we make an exception in certain cases.\" \n\"If you interact with them, you should be surveying their opinion of the service they received. We can't just pick the people who give you positive survey responses.\" \nSigh. \n... \n>ring< \n\"Yes?\" the Boss says. \n\"Hi, I was wondering if you had time to do a client survey?\" the PFY asks. \"You could win an iPhone...\" \n\"Your iPhone,\" I add. \n>slam< \n"}

Your predecessors adopted the tried and true Climate Change methodology of ignoring impending disaster.\" \n\"What do we do NOW?\" the Boss asks. \n\"For a start you'll need to pay that Windows 10 preparedness consultant's bill,\" the PFY says, no doubt contemplating the cheque he'll want made out to \"Computer Assistance Service Helpline\" . \n\"Right,\" the Boss nods. \n\"Order these two new desktops >shuffle< to replace the ones that couldn't be upgraded.\" \n\"Uh, yes,\" he says, with a tinge of doubt in his voice, if I'm not mistaken. \n\"Order these graphics cards, monitors, keyboards and headsets.\" \n\"Uh... that's a little excessive isn't it?\" \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"It says here that you want a gaming headset, mouse and keyboard.\" \n\"Of course. Gaming gear's built for resiliency. You hardly want your lift crashing into the sub-basement 40 metres per second because a cheap keyboard switch didn't open at the right time.\" \n\"Oh... I.. but headsets? Why do those machines need headsets?\" \n\"You mean why would I need a headset to Skype to the PFY to tell him how to reset the security system to let people out of the basement?\" \n\"Oh, I see.\" \n\"And why are you getting them delivered to your homes?\" the Director asks. \n\"It's simple\" I explain, as if to an idiot \"they'll require advanced configuration which needs to be done precisely and sequentially. We can't have people interrupting us when the installation is going on.\" \n\"What advanced configurations that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Hardware drivers, BIOS handshaking, flux capacitor decoupling.

Even the tyres – if you're wondering. \n\"Thanks to these new laminated windows,\" I say, tapping the recently replaced floor-to-ceiling glasswork. \"Although it appears the glaziers may have cut some corners in replacing some of the safety bolts and instead just epoxied hexagonal stainless steel billets onto the window frame in their place. My understanding is that until we check each one there's a possibility that the occasional window could flip open...\" \nThe room gets suddenly more cramped as everyone takes a couple of steps away from the windows. \n\"Now, I know many of you had dealings with David – in fact, I think our department manager here had been doing quite a bit of work with him on auditing the budget for the proposed system upgrade. I think my assistant and I have received several hundred requests for further information from them in the past week or so.\" \nThe room gets even smaller as everyone takes a couple of steps away from the Boss while maintaining a safe distance from the windows. \nThe thing is, I don't mind questions. The opportunity to explain why I opt for excessive redundancy in a hypervisor platform is an indication that a manager wants to understand how we take server infrastructure seriously. \nWhat I'm not so keen on are questions like \"What's a domain controller?\" , \"Why do we need a router?\" and \"Does IPv6 cost more than IPv4'?\" , \"Couldn't we try some IPv5 and upgrade to 6 in next year's budget?\" and \"Have you looked for cheaper IP on eBay?\" \nEven these questions wouldn't be so bad if they were actually interested in the answers but in reality all they're hoping for is that one of us will go \"Wait a minute, IPv5 – I never thought of that! It'll save us so much money!!!\" \nInstead they're like a vegan eating one of my strangely flavoursome meat-substitute pies but not wanting to know how I could get so much fake meat flavour and texture in one package while maintaining their moral high ground. \nI'm not the only one who's annoyed. I know for a fact that the PFY has been talking to a mate with an EDM machine about putting hairline fractures in the base of the Boss's chair in preparation for the world's first pneumatic suppository – so the Boss understands firsthand what a pain in the arse is. \nIn any case, we have to get this budget approved to get everything underway. \n\"So you see,\" I say to the Boss once most of the department has dispersed back to their offices. \"These go here, they talk through those to all the desktops here. All gigabit. We're sticking with IPv4 for now, but everything can do IPv6 if we ever make that move.\" \n\"Yes, but do we need to do it?\" the Boss asks. \n\"You're the one who started the upgrade ball rolling with the Windows 7 thing in the first place!\" I snap. \"We may as well address everything at once.\" \n\"Yes, but it's a lot of money. We won't get approval!\" \n\"We might with the new Head of Accounting,\" I suggest. \"I hear they're interviewing internal applicants this afternoon and the only room in the building which hasn't been mysteriously booked out is on the fourth floor right above that Volvo. I'm feeling pretty confident that we'll reach a decision. With any luck we could have new desktops and screens for everyone.\" \nWithin moments the room starts filling up with people again because if there's one thing that geeks like, it's new kit. I'm flashing brochures of 4K screens and ergonomic keyboards to the assembled horde like I'm a commission-based salesperson – which in a way I am. And the staff are eating it up – if I may say so myself. I can only agree with them that two monitors is a ridiculous workplace limitation and that social media, mail and real work should be physically separated by monitor.

He is me, 30 years ago... what to do?","Link":"\/2020\/03\/06\/bofh_2020_episode_5\/","Content":"Episode 5 I am having an existential crisis. \nIn front of me is a youth, no older than the PFY was when I first met him, full of enthusiasm for a role in IT. \"Green and keen\" as the saying goes. \nTo him the prospect of IT support is a limitless expanse of exciting experiences – a veritable cornucopia of learning at his gesture-enabled fingertips. \nHe's young, mildly entitled and will never feel the sting of a lowly helpdesk position. His grades and experience are such that he's destined for the fast tracks of either IT Management or IT Project Management – whichever pays the most at the time. The world is his oyster. \nHe may even be my Boss someday... \nAnd he is here at Mission Control – not to try and glean favours, not to throw his fate-based birthright around and certainly not to ask leading questions designed to trap the unwary. \nHe has come to seek knowledge. \nHe wants to know how a career in IT really works. \nHence my existential crisis. On the one hand I could tell him that a career in IT will bring him into contact with the leading minds of his age and will open doors to unseen technical wonders, promotion, popularity, riches and perhaps even one day a knighthood. Or I could tell the truth and say that the pursuit of professional excellence in IT will leave him a bitter and twisted husk of a man, trusting no one and with a cynical streak so wide they could land an A380 on it. \nThe crux of the crisis, though, is whether he deserves that. Recounting the lowlights of my lifetime of disillusionment to him would be a bit like taking a hammer to the head of an unsuspecting and naively trusting pet lamb. \nOr do I take what some would call a moral path and lie – leave him to find his way through a career in IT where each layer of trust is relentlessly peeled away by clients and vendors alike until all that's left is a disenfranchised professional with a head full of knowledge and a back pocket full of powdered glass – for when it's his turn to make tea? \nI just don't know. \nOn the one hand there's the brutal – but some would say kinder – hammer to the lamb's face, but on the other there's the deaths of a thousand demanding incompetents!? \nI just don't know. \nDo I tell him about the pre-sales people he'll meet with no understanding of the technology they're promoting but who have an almost religious fervour to their assurance that it will be just what he's looking for. \nDo I tell him about the technical sales people that will follow in the next rank after the pre-sales people, who will try and sell him futureproof kit which will be discontinued, scant months after purchase? \nOr do I tell him about the customer relationship managers who will follow – trying to convince him to replace that same kit about 11 months into its \"infinite\" lifetime with newer kit with features that no one will ever need? \nDo I preach about the shift from selling a software product to leasing it so as to convert the client into a revenue stream with no added value? \nOr do I tell him about the users – many of whom believe that successfully watching an Xbox upgrade has bestowed upon them the technical wherewithal to challenge a group policy put in place to protect the rest of the company from their pedestrian attitude to data security? \nMaybe I tell him about the leagues of managers he will have – and the importance of tracking which building site is about to do a concrete pour of a deep foundation. Maybe I coach him on the virtues of always having a roll of carpet, a spade, some lime and some potential uncharted wasteland on hand. \nAnd this kid is keen. He wants to work for free to get some practical experience of what the IT industry is really about. He's skilled, intelligent and he looks like he could come up with his own solutions for problems without relying on the burnt-out has-beens that have gone before him. \nIn a sentence fragment – he is me, 30 years ago. \nAnd as much as I see his naivety as a hindrance to his future prospects, and even though I think that he will be walked all over by clients, vendors and managers alike, I still can't bring myself to break him on the rack of my past experiences. \nLooking back at my past, I can only wish that someone had provided me with some sort of gentle guidance to steer me in the right direction. \nI must do for him what I would want in his place. \n\"Sure,\" I say. \"I'll give you a couple of pointers. Come here, over by the window.\" \nBecause mostly, I'd want to be taught a lesson – and who better to teach you than experience? \nBesides, all that lamb business has me gagging for a Kabuli palaw from the Afghani place down the road and it's only an hour to lunchtime. Or it's lunchtime – if you're a bitter and twisted husk of a man. \n"}

I was thinking I might just pop in.\" \nSymptom Two: Lowered feeling of self-worth from being away from work too long. \n\"No need.\" \n\"Well, I thought I'd maybe pop in and check anyway. And while I was at it I thought I'd check out the cafeteria as they're always leaving things on…\" \nSymptom Three: Cunning. \nThe problem with isolation is that with a holiday you have IN THEORY planned something to do with your time and so have an objective in mind. In a case like this where the company proactively implemented a lockdown days before anyone else had too much time on their hands and didn't know what to do with it, the Boss is just searching for some believable reason why he simply has to get out of the house for a day – or possibly two if he could swing it. \n\"No point, you wouldn't be able to get into the building anyway. It's in lockdown.\" \nBut you can override it?” The Boss asks, with a hint of desperation in his voice. \nAnd to be honest I do feel a bit for the bloke. Having only witnessed his marital \"bliss\" at a couple of brief staff functions, I could honestly say at this stage I'd probably be reaching for the Panadol sandwiches. \n\"Oh, it would be more than my job's worth to override the security system,\" I say, ticking off the \"jobsworth\" box on my isolation check sheet. \nYou have to make your own fun. \n\"But someone should check.\" \n\"I'll ring security.\" \n\"I tried,\" The Boss wheedles. \"No one's answering.\" \n\"It's OK, I can get the camera feeds at home, and I'll find them.\" \n”OK then, but are you sure… \n\"Totally. Look, if I was you, I'd not worry about work and break out the Monopoly!\" I say, knowing full well that adding Monopoly into the Boss's domestic situation will probably result in a homicide. \nI make a mental note to ring the PFY to see if he wants to make a bet about who the survivor will be. \nAgain, making your own fun. \nMy thoughts are interrupted by an alert that someone is trying to gain access to the building and has been denied. It's not security because there's only one per shift now and he's already in the building but confined to the ground floor. (By \"confined\" I mean that I disabled the lift and there's no way any of our guards would attempt the stairs without a resuscitator and a cardiac surgeon on standby…) \nOn the camera feed I can see the potential entrant is one of the guys from the coloured pencil office – the least critical part of the company. I watch him inspecting his card for damage and trying again. On another feed I see our security guard standing about five metres from the door in question, shaking his head while munching on a sandwich. \nDENIED. \n>beedle< >beedle< >boop< \n>beedle< >beedle< >boop< \n\"Yep?\" I say, to the top of the Director's head. \n\"I just had a call from Brian,\" the Director says. \"He thinks there may be some printers left on in the office. He thinks he should go down and check on them.\" \nCHECKING. \n\"I checked all the printers before we left,\" I lie. \"They're all off. I also checked the camera feeds around the building – no printers, photocopiers, screens, toasters, stoves, irons or thermonuclear reactors are on.\" \n\"Are you sure? I think maybe I should pop in and check. I'm probably the closest, so it would b…\" \nSELF-WORTH. \n\"That won't be necessary,\" I say. \"It's all been checked.\" \n\"I still think I might notice something you missed. I could check a couple of floors where the cameras aren't as common. The third floor for instance.\" \nCUNNING. \n\"No, the board was quite clear that once we leave the building we are not to return. Coming back would invalidate some clause in their insurance which is worth more to the company than your employment contract – and pension plan. If you get my meaning.\" \n\"The building could burn down,\" he says, clutching at straws. \n\"No, I'd notice,\" I say. \n\"I... How?\" \n\"I'd hear the alarms. I'd smell the smoke.\" \n\"A... Are you in the building.\" \n\"STILL in the building?\" I ask. \"Yes, I suppose I am.\" \n\"You're living in the building?!\" \n\"Indeed. I mean, I am roughing it a bit – I had to move the huge couches from the boardroom down. And I try to get out to the roof garden as much as I can for exercise, weather permitting. I'm in regular contact with a couple of people in neighbouring buildings who had the presence of mind to similarly exploit certain loopholes in their company's lockdown procedure.\" \n\"Loopholes?\" \n\"Yes, it seems that many of us have a similar contract whereby if we stay on the premises for longer than 24 hours we're entitled to certain benefits.\" \n\"Benefits?\" \n\"Yes, you know salary entitlements etc. but the one thing that I think will interest both you and the Boss – with your fixation on the third floor – is that the company is obliged to feed me.\" \nThe Director seethes wordlessly. \n\"Yes,\" I say. \"The onion bhajis.\" \nWhen the Geneva Convention is extended to food crimes I have no doubt that the company chefs will be summarily executed. However, their one redeeming dish is their onion bhajis. Somehow, like an infinite number of monkeys banging away at an infinite number of mixing bowls, they managed to create a culinary delight that many would kill for – and I just might, if security ever makes it to the first stairwell landing. \nI can see from the Director's expression that I have hit home. \n\"You know, there's an entire freezer full of them, and I have calculated the precise amount I need to deep fry each day to get me through the lockdown period – if I don't die in a methane explosion beforehand. I also found the recipe book and loads of frozen raw materials so I could make any number of dishes which would probably see me to Christmas, but I'll probably just make bhajis. I trade them with neighbouring buildings via wires between the rooftops you know.\" \n\"I'LL MAKE SURE YOU…\" \n\"Or maybe I'm not here at all. I'm certainly not on any security footage. Maybe all the damage will be found to have been caused by some number of street youths who broke into the building. Maybe they defecated on your desk?!\" \n\"!\" \n\"Or maybe you'll just continue along like we never had this conversation and come back to work to a nice clean office with a nice clean desk, with drawers that have only been used for storing office stuff?\" \n>boodle< >boop< \nRight, time to switch the deep fryer on and break out the Fringe box set! \n"}

And, despite being in an age group that makes a cold snap potentially fatal, he's still ticking. \nThanks to his great-grandfathered employment policy, he cannot technically be forced to leave the company's employ until the day of his funeral – at which point he'll still be eligible to claim travel expenses. \nTo be fair, his work speed isn't what it once was – so much so that he's probably on the asset register as furniture, but he nonetheless shows up in the early afternoons to \"do the preliminary work\" of the night-time cleaners. Or, more accurately, sift the bins for bits of paper with two uppercase letters, six lowercase letters and two digits hastily scribbled on them. \nReporting people's conversations is more of a hobby for him now – though many a user uprising in the past has been quelled once the ringleaders have spent a bank holiday weekend trapped between floors in a lift smelling strongly of urine, sweat, and faeces. And maybe a whiff of betrayal. \nThe office, in the meantime, is creeping back to life. I say creeping because the company's a bit wobbly on its position on returning to work at the moment. \nIt's such an inopportune time for George to announce his retirement. \n\"You can't!\" the PFY gasps when George breaks the news to us. \n\"I have!\" George responds. \n\"But who will…\" the PFY begins, before realising that coming in, reading the newspaper over a cup of tea, pushing a cleaning trolley aimlessly around the building for a couple of hours then making another cup of tea and going home early isn't vital. \"... uh ...keep an eye on the users?\" \n\"My nephew,\" says George, pulling out the ID badge of a bloke whose aged appearance would suggest he has a Medalla de la Campaña tie pin that he wears to the pub every 18 July. \n\"But what about you?\" I ask. \"What will you do?\" \n\"Oh, I have a couple of investments,\" he says. \"This building for instance.\" \n\"The company owns this building,\" I shoot back. \n\"No, I own this building,\" George responds. \"In the to-ing and fro-ing of the building sale and purchase agreement they neglected to check that the documents they left on the boardroom table at night were the same ones they signed in the morning. And the 12-year upfront rent payment runs out tomorrow, at which point they'll need to negotiate a new lease.\" \n\"12 years?\" \n\"Yes, it was a guess on my part about the amount of time it would take all the signatories to leave the company, leave the board or pass away from natural causes.\" \nAbout now I'm wondering if \"natural causes\" includes a recent unsolved hit-and-run involving one of the eldest board members... \n\"But they bought it from the owners!\" I say. \n\"They LEASED it from the NEW owner – me. I bought the building from the previous owner – a government department – for £1, yet another example of people not checking the documents they leave on the desk at night are exactly the same as the ones they sign in the morning. They didn't fight the sale too vigorously, though, as the building had recently received an appalling structural integrity rating.\" \n\"...As a result of a board not considering that a document might have been added into the board papers?\" I ask. \n\"It was a combination of things really,\" George responds. A board not considering that a seismic report document might have been added to the board papers; not considering that a second document in the form of a legal opinion about the personal liability of local government officials had been added to the papers; a board not asking who commissioned the structural review; and a board not asking who called the special general meeting in the first place. \n\"They were simpler times,\" he adds, smiling wistfully. \n\"So you OWN this building?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Oh yes,\" he replies. \n\"So why are you cleaning it?!\" \n\"A) to keep an eye on my asset, B) to enable me to slip the occasional page into the 'to be signed' folder on the CEO's desk noting that the 12-year lease is due to expire (for audit trail purposes), and C) for the fun of it.\" \n\"They'll sue you.\" \n\"I have rock-solid Sale & Purchase and Lease agreements and photocopies of those audit trail documents,\" he says. \n\"Someone will know,\" I say. \n\"I believe the only remaining lease signatory is our retired legal counsel – though he recently had a little mishap when someone forgot to close a window,\" he says. I doubt he'll have much to add in the time he has left. So once I've negotiated a new lease then sold the building I think I'll have a nice little nest egg to live off. \n\"If the sale documents haven't become lease documents overnight,\" he adds. \nI feel like I've wasted my life. ® \n"}

Pointing out the waste of a portable device for someone who HAS to be in the office didn't seem to make much difference... \nA MONTH ago, when faced with the prospect of returning to work, those same staff were of the opinion that their presence was not completely necessary and in hindsight they would probably be just as productive using their child's five-year-old Chromebook and postal mail. \nTODAY, we're back to supercritical presence again – but only from home. \nThere's a flurry of activity as people loot the office for stuff they can build a technical blanket-fort with – and that's on top of all the stuff that didn't make it back from the first lockdown. \n\"I need a proper chair for home,\" a user bleats at me. \n\"I'm sorry, I don't understand.\" \n\"A chair. I need a chair that I can work from at home, like the one at the office, which I was using from home, but I've now brought back in. I need one for home now,\" he whines. \n\"Why don't you use the one you brought back in?\" \n\"One of the wheels is broken.\" \n\"Right. Though the bit I don't understand is why you're telling me?\" \n\"Because it's a computer chair, and you have to authorise it.\" \n\"(a) It's an office chair, not a computer chair; (b) even if it were – by some stretch of the imagination – a computer chair, it's still furniture which your manager would approve. There's probably another reason too.\" \n\"If there's another reason I'd like to hear it,\" he simpers. \n\"I think once you've leapt the hurdles of '(a) not a computer chair' and '(b) not my problem' we'll be ready to fully address that third reason. By that stage option (c) might involve what will later be described in the media as 'a frenzied attack'.\" \nI take a hammer out of my drawer and place it gently on the table. \nIt's only a short time later that the Boss comes in. \n\"What was that about?\" he asks, pointing at the door. \n\"Sorry\" I say, \"I just need you to put a mask on.\" \n\"What?!\" he snaps. \n\"A mask. You need a mask to enter this room. I'm immune compromised. My liver might be shot from years of... uh... exercise.\" \n\"I'm only asking what went on with that guy that just left.\" \n\"I'm sorry but if you're not going to follow the correct procedure I'll have to socially distance you.\" \n\"You mean socially distance yourself,\" he corrects me. \n\"If you like,\" I say, pulling out the broom handle I'd taped a cattle prod to early this morning. \nThe Boss steps back warily. \n\"He says you threatened him,\" the Boss says, again gesturing towards the door where a nervous shadow can be seen lurking behind the one way glass. \n\"That wasn't a threat,\" I say. \"A threat's more like 'IS THAT YOUR LATE MODEL WHITE BMW 3 SERIES ON FIRE OUTSIDE?'\" \nThe shadow behind the door disappears rapidly, while the Boss pulls a disposable mask from the box on a chair by the door. \n\"Anyway, so you said he couldn't have a chair?\" \n\"I said I wasn't going to pay for a computer chair – because it's not a computer chair, it's a chair. To be a computer chair it would need to have a computer in it.\" \n\"And I'd totally have one of them if we were ordering them,\" the PFY says coming in and looking at the Boss strangely. \n\"What?\" the Boss says. \n\"I was just wondering why you're wearing a second-hand mask.\" \n\"It's not second-hand, it's from that box by the door.\" \n\"Oh, the box with 'contaminated – for secure disposal' written in very, very small letters on the top?\" I ask. \"They're used masks.\" \n\"Who used them?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"No idea, I picked them up off the street on the way to work. But don't worry, I was wearing gloves at the time.\" \nThe Boss dashes off to organise a disinfectant IV on a tanning bed while the PFY fills me in on his office survey. It looks like around 20 per cent of people's office kit has disappeared to home offices and I'd guess – based on the last lockdown stats – that only half of it will ever be returned. \nBeing strategic thinkers we immediately move all the crappiest gear and furniture from our office into the most empty offices in the building then take a snapshot of mission control and fire off an email to the department director saying we've been ransacked – and that we're going to need the kit replaced immediately just to keep the company afloat. \nThe director is on a Zoom call to us within 20 minutes, examining the background of our image intently. \n\"Who the hell would do that?\" he asks, surveying the emptiness of mission control. \n\"I don't know,\" the PFY says, \"but it's likely they took our gear because it was high-grade stuff.\" \n\"They even took our computer chairs,\" I say. \n\"You mean office chairs,\" the Director says. \n\"No, they were computer chairs. They had computers in them. Special computers. Which is probably why they were taken.\" \n\"I see. Well, I suppose we'll just have to submit it as a COVID-19 expense.\" \n\"I guess so,\" I sigh, shaking my head in fake sadness. \n\"Did... someone take your bookshelf?\" he asks. \n\"Apparently,\" I say, shaking my head again. \n\"Why would anyone take a bloody bookshelf?\" he asks. \n\"Well, it was a COMPUTER bookshelf,\" I say. ® \n"}

They have pulse indicators so we could count the pulses and make a 10 minute average.\" \n\"And we could use that to work out how much power we use during the day?\" he asks. \"And then divide that by the number of people in the building to work out the maximum amount that people could claim per day for power when they're working from home?\" \n\"Uh, theoretically,\" the PFY lies. \n…5 minutes later in the plant room... \n\"So that's the main meter there?\" the Boss asks. \"The one with the flashing light?\" \n\"The rapidly flashing light, yes,\" the PFY says. \n\"What does that mean?\" \n\"It pulses once per kilowatt hour - though I suspect this one's internally set with a 10x - or 100x multiplier.\" \n\"Meaning?\" \nMeaning we're using a pantload of power,” I reply. \n\"How much power?\" \nTime for some quick mental maths. I take the number of highly flammable carpet tiles stacked in the corner of the room, multiply that by the sum of the number of pulses per second and the number of machine screws missing from the front panel of the switchboard then divide that by the number of shunted heat detectors on the ceiling and give the Boss the result. \n\"Is that a lot?\" he asks. \n\"Not for a small township,\" I think, but being a problem solver, I just say \"No.\" \nThe Boss nods thoughtfully then responds, \"The other thing I'm proposing is that with the increasing number of people working from home at the moment we could encourage everyone to work from home and just switch the building off. To save power.\" \nThere is a moment's respectful silence for the death of a stupid idea before the PFY speaks. \n\"What?!\" he asks, turning towards the Boss. \n\"Switch the building off.\" \n\"Oh, OK,\" the PFY says. \nZzzzz >CLACK!< \n\"I DIDN’T BLOODY MEAN NOW!\" the Boss shouts from the darkness. \n\"Oh!\" the PFY says, feigning stupidity whilst reaching for the breaker lever in the dark. \n>Clack!< \n\"Should you really have turned the power back on that quickly?\" the Boss asks nervously. \"Don't you always say that we should leave it 30 seconds because of fault currents or something?\" \n\"Good point!\" the PFY says. \nZzzzz >CLACK!< \n\"WELL DON'T TURN THE BLOODY POWER OFF AGAIN!!!\" \n>Clack!< \n\"WAIT BLOODY 30 SECONDS!\" \nZizz >CLACK!< \n\"DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!\" the Boss rages from the darkness \n…29 seconds later... \n\"OK,\" the Boss says, speaking slowly and precisely. \"Now I just want you to turn the power on and I don't want you to turn it off again.\" \n\"OK,\" the PFY says. \n>Clack!< \n\"Now I suppose we’ll need to see if all that switching on and off has caused any damage,\" he says. \n\"Oh, it's bound to have caused some damage,\" I say. \"We just don't know what it is yet.\" \n\"What?\" the Boss gasps, as the albatross of responsibility wraps its feathered wings around his shoulders. \n\"Who knows?\" I reply. \"The server room will be fine, but I can guarantee that some of our ageing aircon compressors will be toast.\" \n\"How do we find out?\" \n\"Look at the A\/C system monitor. When it comes up,\" I say. \n\"If it comes up,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Unless it has caught fire,\" I counter. \n\"Why would it catch fire?\" \n\"It dates back to the 70s,\" I say. \"It's a wall of relays, lamps and motorised timers all held together by hope and insulation tape.\" \n\"Didn't you say we replaced that a few years ago?\" \n\"The server room aircon. The building aircon's ancient.\" \n\"Though not as ancient the fire alarm,\" the PFY adds. \"Parts of it date back to when fire was invented. The aircon system could catch fire but we'd never know because the fire system might have blown a fuse and we'd never know.\" \n\"THE FIRE SYSTEM'S OFFLINE?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Who knows?\" \n\"You should!\" the Boss snaps back. \n\"No, no, the Building Manager should know - but he's working from home.\" \n\"HOW DO WE CHECK THE FIRE SYSTEM?!\" \n\"We could look at the fire indicator panel - that was replaced a couple of years ago,\" the PFY says. \n\"Where?!\" \nWe tell the Boss and there's a mad dash upstairs to look at the indicator panel. \n\"So it's OK then,\" he sighs, seeing the green System Normal light. \n\"Possibly,\" I nod. \n\"Possibly?\" \n\"Well that's just the indicator panel. The System Normal relay could have fused shut in the master panel and we'd never know.\" \n\"HOW DO WE CHECK?\" \n\"Oh, the master panel's back in the plant room.\" \n…another mad dash later... \n\"Is it OK?\" the Boss asks, staring at a panel with a single slowly blinking red light on it. \n\"Possibly,\" the PFY says. \"The light could mean the system is on, but the flashing could mean there's a fault. Maybe the light should be green and not flashing.\" \n\"How do we find out?\" \n\"Well could force a fault condition then see what the lamp does?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"What, set the alarm off?!?!?\" the Boss blurts. \n\"No, something simple.

IEEE... \" \nI globally >MUTE< everyone's microphones – including our presenter. \n\"Who's that guy?\" I ask the PFY. \"He looks familiar.\" \n\"He's that hippy fruity nutbar from down the road who comes to the pub sometimes. Greg... no, Granv.. GRAYSON! Grayson someone.\" \n\"?\" \n\"He's some sort of life-working visionary slash regenerative workplace consultant slash personal presence guru that one of the board members latched onto at after-work drinks a year or two ago. He works out of that huge co-working space on the first floor of a building down the street. The one with the ironic graffiti on the walls.\" \n\"Oh yes, I know the office you mean – in fact I can see it in his background right now. So what's he do?\" \n\"He comes into companies, interviews everyone about how they're feeling and asks them about the five best and worst things about the company. Then he gets everyone together for a day-long workplace regeneration workshop where you can celebrate everyone's strengths, help them with their weaknesses and create a vision about where the company should be going. Apparently it's quite empowering.\" \n\"Not as empowering as 240 A\/C I'd imagine – though you seem to know a lot about it,\" I say. \n\"Yeah, we did it last year when you were on holiday. Well, most of it anyway. Unfortunately, Grayson was struck by a van on his way to the day-long workshop.\" \n\"Yesss, I remember seeing the panel-beating invoice! So why's he here now?\" I ask, noting that our presenter – along with a fair few of the other participants – are fruitlessly attempting to unmute their microphones. \n\"Did you not read the email?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Was it sent to me?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Then of course I didn't read it. You know my purview is other people's email. If you want me to read something, send it to someone else with the subject line PRIVATE AND PERSONAL.\" \n\"OK, well, long story short, the Company wants to implement TBA – Together But Apart.\" \n\"Grayson's idea?\" I ask. \n\"Probably. Anyway, the company is concerned about the impact of distance working and how we can be both safe and maintain a healthy group dynamic.\" \n\"...and not spend a month on the sofa watching endless YouTube videos and discovering new food combinations involving lard and crisps – while pretending to be working from home,\" I add. \"Something like that.\" \n\"OK, so what's going on here?\" I say, pointing at several of the participants' images. \n\"Grayson's idea. He thought it would be great fun to personalise our backgrounds. You really didn't read the email did you?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"He encouraged us to share our dream workplace as our custom background image – as a conversation starter.\" \n\"Really? >tap< >tap< >tappity< >tap< >click< >tap< >clickety< >click< >tap< >tap< >TAP!<\" \n>UNMUTE< \nMy ears are assaulted by 40 or so people saying things like \"...this thing on?\" , \"...ear me?\" , and \"stupid bloody...\" \nMoments later, Grayson works out how to mute everyone but himself and begins to talk. He rambles on for a while about how great everyone is and how he's got a good feeling about something or the other and how we should be congratulated for our commitment to the future of this pointless exercise. He bangs on for a while until his focus shifts from himself to his screen. \n\"Ahhhhh... Simon... uhhhmmm your background image is... aaahhhmmmm.\" \nI take a quick look to see what he's talking about. There does appear to be an awful lot of pink in my background image. And I mean awful. That said, it would be significantly more awful if my head wasn't covering part of the picture... \n\"Yes?\" \n\"It's probably not something that should be...\" \n\"Oh, it's not mine,\" I say. \"I've written a script to pick a random image from the browser cache of our user's desktops. You know, as a conversation starter.\" \nWhile I'm talking the image changes to a box of Blackwing 602s which will have come from my cache. Grayson seems happier. \n\"Anyway,\" he continues, \"as I was saying, we're planning a series of sessions to encourage people to support each until we're all back together. We're calling the first sessions the 'Christmas Cheer'. People have 15 minutes to tell us all a little bit about who they are, what they are, and where they see themselves in five years. By the time we're all back in the office full-time we'll know more about what makes our fellow work...\" \nGrayson stops once more as my background image changes to something I certainly hope is part of a medical procedure. \"Sadly,\" I say, overriding Grayson's mute, \"I think my assistant and myself won't be able to do this nor listen to these sessions as we're a bit snowed under with work at the moment. So much to do while the company is in its present state. I mean, just keeping this conferencing software running at these unprecedented levels is almost overwhelming.\" \n\"It's OK,\" Grayson says, as my background changes to the Riviera. \"We've signed up to a multi-presence company that does everything for you – all you have to do is install the app.\" \nI look over in the PFY's direction to note that he's not all that keen on remotely installing\/supporting software on people's systems – particularly as half the people are working from their home desktops. \n\"We've signed up Grayson as well – he'll be spearheading the installation from his office,\" the Boss chips in, unmuted by Grayson in what I consider to be an act of aggression. \"So you'll have plenty of time on your hands.\" \n\"Which brings me to our next great idea – we thought we'd start the sessions off with a whole-of-company Christmas carol. Studies have shown that people who sing together...\" \nMy attention is momentarily diverted somewhat by the PFY stalking out of the room in disgust, but I get back to Grayson's monologue on how singing is good for the lungs and heart and is also known to reduce blood pressure. He goes on to explain how he will stream the music and words to us so we can sing along – and as an added bonus he'll record the whole thing and make it available on our website. \nJoy of joys! \n\"Is that a Christmas-themed tie?\" I gasp, full of joy, and definitely not because I have just seen a ladder appear outside the windows in Grayson's background. \n\"This?\" he says happily, bringing the camera closer. \"No, this is just a green micro-floral houndstooth. You'll note the seasonal red undertones, however it's not a Christmas tie per se, more of a...\" \n>KZERRTT!< A second or so later the camera goes black and the microphone is muted – though the session doesn't disconnect. \nA few more seconds pass... \n\"Well,\" I say to the assembled hordes, \"it seems obvious to me. If I'm reading this correctly, the first carol would appear to be Silent Night!\" \n"}

With no one to talk to about how they converted all their model train rolling stock from narrow gauge to standard gauge, they feel that they may have a kindred spirit or two at Mission Control. \nAnd so it is that one of the helldesk guys has cornered the PFY and is regaling him with holiday DND adventures. \"...and my main character has an amethyst-encrusted enchanted Greatsword,\" he burbles happily. \"And you know what that has?\" \n\"A plus 6 defence against girlfriends?\" the PFY asks. \n\"A plus 4 ability to bore strangers?\" I suggest, wishing I'd said what the PFY did. \n\"It's the most powerful weapon!\" he blurts. \"Anyway, I did the 2d6 roll and you know what came up?\" \n\"A good portion of my breakfast?\" I suggest, though I'm still wishing I'd said the defence against girlfriends thing. \n\"No, I got a 3 and a 4 – which meant...\" \nI dash off quickly to answer the soundless ring of an invisible phone – in another room – leaving the PFY to it... \n... whereupon my sense of inner peace was almost immediately interrupted by the Boss. \n\"Just thought I'd check in to see if everything started up as planned?\" he asks. \n\"No problems. The PFY and I came in over the break to make sure all the essentials services were running correctly.\" (We didn't.) \nI continued: \"We had a couple of issues that we needed to sort out, but it was only a day's work.\" (We didn't – and it wasn't.) \n\"Anyway,\" the Boss says, changing the subject with his trademark subtlety, \"the Director and I have been talking about sterilising.\" \n\"It's probably for the best – may as well chlorinate that particular gene pool.\" \n\"I meant keyboards, mice – that sort of thing.\" \n\"Oh right, but surely people don't share keyboards and mice?\" \n\"Well, desks and door handles then.\" \n\"Ah, so a buildings maintenance problem?\" \n\"They wonder if there's a technical solution?\" \n\"You mean some automated device that would patrol the building sterilising equipment with some sort of ultraviolet lamp and hand sanitiser combo?\" \n\"YES! Could we do that?!\" \n\"Sure. The effectiveness would depend on the strength of both the lamp and the sanitiser.\" \n\"But if you upped the strength really high?\" \n\"I guess you'd approach 100 per cent viral kill rate.\" \n\"Excellent – what would it cost?\" \n\"Probably just the cost of the lamp and sanitiser. We have the bare bones of some old AI robot hardware somewhere in the basement we could repurpose.\" \n\"Make it so!\" the Boss chortles. \n\"Are you sure you wan...\" \n\"Indeed!\" he blurts, proceeding to warp off to some other area of the department. \n...TWO DAYS LATER... \n\"In retrospect,\" I say to the Director, \"I blame myself. I should have checked the backup battery and should not have just cut-and-pasted the word 'ultraviolent' from the Boss's email. Maybe spell checker would have picked that up.\" \n\"Surely it should have thrown up some sort of error?\" \n\"Unfortunately, the word ULTRAVIOLENT was in the system ROM – along with ULTRAVIOLET. Whereas some of the other reserved words – like CHAINSAW, STAPLE GUN and ROTATING KNIVES were not mentioned in this particular operating code.\" \n\"So what actually happened?\" \n\"As near as we can figure – because obviously the ROM was lost in the fire – the bot was sanitising according to plan. We had some teething issues – i.e. the full UV output being sufficient to oxidise plastic, fade carpet tiles and give you third-degree sunburn in about five minutes – but I think the real problem was the flammability of the vapourised sanitiser when combined with the heat from the lamps.\" \n\"Nyess,\" the Director says... \n\"But after that it's all supposition on our part. We assume that the AI somehow worked out a link between people with poor hygiene and – although obviously not in all cases – the transmission of the virus that it was supposed to sanitise and decided to... uh... cut out the middleman, as it were. And, uh... because of the Boss's insistence on upping the whole 'ultraviolence' thing I guess that fireballs were the, uh, an inevitable response.\" \n\"I see. But there's no need to put all of this in your report I shouldn't think.\" \n\"Well, to make changes to that finalised document without leaving what some people might call an 'audit trail', I'd need some pretty advanced Word skills – and they don't come cheap now that everyone's upskilling in their free time…\" \n\"How much are you suggesting?\" \n\"I don't know,\" I say, rolling a slightly melted d6 and getting a 4. \"I think they run to about four grand – for the 'advanced' course.\" \nI take the Director's sigh as a sign of assent. \n\"But on the upside...\" \n\"There's an upside?\" \nYeah! There has been a huge drop-off in the number of people complaining that we're not letting them into the office – AND the Company's payroll liability tapered right off when I mentioned the bot had a GPS, their home address and online access to the active employees database... \n"}

You'll need to end this call though. \" \n\"OK! >click<,\" the Boss says. \nI wait patiently and about 15 minutes while the Boss is no doubt listening to the \"instructions\" that are telling him how sleepy he is and how restful the spiral is and that he's feeling totally relaxed… \nShortly after the 15 minutes are up, the Boss is on our daily departmental videoconference call. There's a bit of silence as people wait for him to start the meeting - or maybe they're just wondering why he's completely naked and smeared in Marmite. \nThe call ends abruptly when the Boss's laptop is shut abruptly when he's only halfway through a rousing rendition of \"I’m a little teapot.\" \nHalf an hour later the Boss is back on the videoconference to the department feeling a little sheepish. He makes some fairly transparent excuse about having a bad reaction to the vaccine and then proceeds to run through the daily task lists. \n\"… and Simon – how's my access to the building going?\" he asks, having no recollection of our earlier conversation – as instructed. \"Unfortunately you're not on the list of people crucial to the operation of the company.\" \n\"Not bloody crucial!

A fluffy pink unicorn appears on the screen. \n\"What's that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Uh, that's my client's emotional support animal - another of his new contractual entitlements.\" \n\"That's just ridiculous.\" \n\"No, the new contract states that the company values its employees and their needs in trying times and that they are entitled to emotional support animals in meetings.\" \n\"It's not a real animal!\" \n\"The contract doesn't limit the support process to real animals, it simply says animals.\" \n\"I see.\" the Boss says, just wanting to get this over with. \"Rather than debate this with you, I...\" \nAnother incoming call comes onto the screen. \nI answer. \n\"Who's that?\" the Boss asks, as the new addition's on-screen picture lurches around the place. \n\"That's my emotional support animal,\" I say. \"As I'd mentioned, our new contract entitles us to emotional support animals in meetings.\" \n\"IT'S NOT YOUR MEETING!\" \n\"Again, the contract doesn't clarify who is entitled, it just says meetings.\" \n\"I see,\" the Boss says. \"Well regardless, there's no animal there and the camera is broken.\" \n\"No, the camera's fine - my emotional support animal is a housefly.

Then I accidentally dropped the replacement down a storm grate, and the third phone had some battery issue which looked a lot like it'd been put in a 1,200W inverter microwave on high for 25 minutes. But actually, it was only 20. So now the PFY and I are dealing with six-plus months of secluded user insanity. \n\"My email only works sometimes,\" one of our first complainants says. \n\"So it worked when responding to... uh.. discount pizza offers, then mysteriously failed when your work deadlines fell due?\" the PFY asks, perusing the Sent Items folder on her machine. \n\"It wasn't just me – my daughter emailed santa@google.com before Christmas and didn't get an answer.\" \n\"In actual fact she emailed satan@google.com,\" the PFY says, digging further into the Sent Items. \n\"So at least she got the domain name right,\" I chip in. \"Anyway, it's not working.\" \n\"Hmmm,\" the PFY says, bashing the delete key several times. \"I think it's all working – bar the 10 seasons of Taskmaster you tried emailing one of your office mates.\" \n\"I split them up!\" she simpers. \n\"Into seasons,\" the PFY says, shaking his head. Sigh. \nNext up we have a bloke who can't work his laptop. To be fair it's not his fault. When lockdown occurred, the company lobbied far and wide, insisting we were crucial to the nation's wellbeing. \nThis was then followed up with an application for a hefty government grant to act as a \"centre of excellence for working-from-home methodology.\" \nThe application itself was full of the sort of new-age \"wellness and mindfulness\" gravy that passes as science to politicians wanting to show they're decisive but still able to think outside the box. It was completely immeasurable, totally subjective, and came with crypto-mantras like \"freeing our isolated selves\" , \"aligning oneself with wholeness\" , and \"we're only truly alone with negative others.\" \nThe only trick they missed was not using a semi-famous actress with a double major in platitudes and non-specific eastern mysticism to spearhead the campaign. HOWEVER, in a decision that cannot be explained to – or by – any sane person, the company got the money and spent it on high-spec laptops for any staff not quick enough to steal the good stuff from a fellow worker's office. \nAnd over half of it has sat, unconfigured (due to IT phone breakages), until now... \nAnd in five minutes the PFY has him configured. \n\"Uh...\" he mumbles, gesturing at our corridor, \"what do I do with that?\" \n\"What is it?\" I ask. \n\"I don't know what it is. It came with the laptop. It says 3KVA UPS.\" \n\"Ah well, it's probably the... uh... Update Processing Server. For your laptop.\" \n\"It says it was made in 1994.\" \n\"No, that's the serial number,\" the PFY says. \"It's painted on.\" \n\"Yeah, that's the blockchain tattooing underpinning the cryptoalgorithm. For security. You wouldn't want dodgy updates.\" \nAt this point I think even the PFY has lost track of the gibberish he's speaking. The great thing about people who're expecting expensive kit is that they tend to sign for anything in an IT-looking parcel thinking it's more presents. Which it is – but not to him. \nIn a few short months we shipped every piece of ancient IT rubbish that'd clogged up our storeroom off to unsuspecting users at their homes – under the guise of a technology refresh. \nThe hardest part of the process was convincing a courier to dump-and-run. However, a short negotiation involving some polymer sheets with the Queen's portrait on them seemed to sort that problem out. \n\"Well, I don't need it,\" our user says. \n\"And neither do we,\" the PFY says. \"We don't need an... Upgrade Server.\" \n\"From 1992,\" I say. \"You know you can't just bring your home rubbish into work. I mean there's the dumping fees to consider if we took it. Though I guess you could lug it back home on the tube if you want.\" \nTen minutes and £40 later, the UPS is being relabelled with the Boss's home address, along with a Microvax 3100 wrapped in several layers of cardboard and labelled \"Fragile Audio Equipment.\" \nBy the end of the day we have half a van full of stuff for the Boss, including three overhead projectors, an A3 laser printer, and a box full of those keyboard vacuum cleaners that everyone used for about a minute before dumping. \nWhile the PFY puts the label on, I call our courier using the delivery phrase \"late night front garden job.\" I'm sure he'll be pleased with it when he gets back from holiday... \n"}

And - more importantly - our mailers are configured to ignore message recalls.\" \nA hint of 'forest fruits' permeates the room as the Head Beancounter's antiperspirant kicks into turbo. \n\"No, we said THAT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME we would be accounting for new hardware that people required - for business continuity purposes - as a COVID expense,\" he blurts hurriedly. \n\"There... wouldn't happen to be an auditor in the building would there?\" I ask. \"Some representative of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs service want to fine-tooth-comb through our COVID expenses?\" \n\"What makes you say that?\" he snaps back a little too quickly. \n\"Wasn't you who said an audit was on the furthest realms of possibility,\" I say. \"Something about how they'd have 'bigger fish to fry' and all that...\" \n\"I don't know who...\" \n\"And then in this year's interim financial report, didn't you say that the astute guidance of the financials group had kept the company out of trouble - though perhaps not out of court?\" \n... \n\"Obviously we're not accusing anyone of any wrongdoing\" the auditor lies. \"We're just trying to make sure that all these expenses are correctly identified. Ultimately it'll be good for both the company and the country.\" \n\"Only too happy to help,\" I say. \"As a taxpayer myself I'm very keen to ensure that my hard earned money is being spent correctly.\" \nOut of the corner of my eye I can see the Head Beancounter dabbing at his collar as the room starts to smell like potpourri. \n\"You paid.. £70 for a wired mouse and keyboard ?\" \n\"Yes, it was all we could get. Because of COVID,\" the PFY says \n\"The same keyboard and mouse set currently retails for £19.\" \n\"We know,\" I sigh. \"We had to get them for people.\" \n\"You bought... 213 of them,\" he says, pulling a tatty receipt from the pile. \n\"Yes, because of COVID.\" \n\"STOP SAYING BECAUSE OF COVID! You bought 213 keyboard sets in one day at 70 quid each. That's over £14,000.\" \n\"One of our cleaners got sick,\" I say. \"They might have touched all the keyboards and mice.\" \n\"Couldn't you have sterilised them?\" \n\"With the cleaning stuff the cleaners had touched?\" the PFY asks. \n\"You could have sterilised that.\" \n\"With the price of sterilisers like it was?\" I gasp. \"It would have been cheaper to use Vodka.\" \n\"You bought 2 dozen bottles of Vodka,\" he says, fingering another receipt. \n\"Like I said, it was cheaper to use vodka.\" \n\"And this was used only for sterilisation?\" \n\"Of course.\" \n\"And do you have any proof that it was used for that?\" \n\"None of our staff got sick.\" \n\"YOU BOUGHT THEM ALL NEW KEYBOARDS AND MICE!\" \n\"Didn't you just question whether that was worthwhile or not?\" I ask. \"Though I admit we may have erred on the side of caution in some cases...\" \n\"You're not kidding,\" he snaps back. \"You ordered two replacement office chairs because they were COVID contaminated.\" \n\"Yes - in our office. The cleaner sat on them. He.. um.. farted.\" \n\"So?\" \n\"Well, you know, COVID germs.\" \n\"YOU CAN'T CATCH COVID FROM FARTS!\" \n\"Well we know that NOW,\" the PFY says. \"I only wish we'd known it before we set fire to the van.\" \n\"You can't claim any of this!\" he snaps back angrily. \"It's a transparent attempt to write off a whole stack of business expenses as being some sort of pandemic expense.\" \n\"We weren't to know these expenses were unjustified. No one knew how COVID was spread. I mean I wouldn't have dumped that brand new espresso machine if I'd known the operating heat would have killed the germs in about 10 minutes.\" \n\"I'm recommending a full audit!\" he snaps - while the Head Beancounter suppresses his internal panic after I type the word seppuku into his search tab - \"We'll do a full 7-year audit. Any dodgy expense claim, any questionable purchase - we'll be right onto it!\" \n\"Going right back?\" the PFY asks, raising an eyebrow. \"Any dodgy expense or purchase?\" \n\"You bet! If there's anything to find, we'll find it.\" \n\"Well I expect you'll be wanting to see the stairwell that we had to replace because of COVID\" he says \"We haven't put that claim in yet.\" \n\"YOU REPLACED A STAIRCASE BECAUSE OF COVID!\" the Auditor gasps. \n\"Yes, it's just over here...\" \n... \n\"That'll be long COVID,\" I say to the Head Beancounter as a faint scream punctuates Mission Control. \n\"A tragedy,\" he nods. \n\"Do you know if long COVID's communicable - or how it's transmitted?\" \n\"No idea,\" he says. \n\"Well, best burn all these receipts then - to be on the safe side...\" \n"}

No, of course this isn't a recording","Link":"\/2021\/06\/04\/bofh_2021_episode_6\/","Content":"Episode 6 \"But you agreed to it!!!\" the Boss snaps at us through the screen. \n(Since COVID he's really embraced the whole videoconferencing vibe as a way of avoiding leaving the comfort of his gas-operated chair.) \"You said you'd do it on one of our Zoom meetings!\" \nThe problem with all those COVID Zoom meetings was the incredible boredom of listening to people lying about how busy they were with all the work they were doing from home. Instead of an honest meeting where people admitted to watching TV in their underwear for the past 2 days, the meetings were instead made up of people itemising the minutia of some project they were pretending to work on. \nIn the end I constructed a video loop of myself which had me blankly staring into the screen, nodding and \"mmm-ing\" randomly when people stopped talking. \nIf the computer detected my name being mentioned on the audio it would wait a short random interval of time before: splicing in a clip of me tapping my headset with a worried expression on my face; splicing a clip of me taking my headset off and shaking it with a confused expression on my face; splicing in one of 12 different buffering problem clips with random pixilation and buzzes; splicing in me asking the speaker to repeat that, then shaking my head 20 seconds later ending the call and marking my Zoom as unavailable; or, very occasionally: me saying \"What, again?\" before picking up a guitar and singing 'Hotel California' until it buffered into an ended call. \nIt was a bloody godsend for avoiding those meetings. In the end I think people just avoided mentioning my name. \n\"You said you were going to issue inventory numbers to all new kit over 1000 pounds!\" the Boss bleats. \n\"Oh, I did that,\" I reply. \n\"So why's Roger's laptop not got an inventory number on it?\" he asks, pointing at a bloke in the background. \n\"Well because (a) I don't issue the physical stickers, Finance does when they enter an asset into the asset register, (b) It was lockdown so I couldn't come and get the stickers if they had been issued and (c), it turned out that numbers I'd issued were duplicates, so even if I had got the stickers it'd probably show up on the asset register as a 1980s 'electronic terminal' with a book value of 7p.\" \n\"So none of these are tracked?!\" he gasps. \n\"No.\" \n\"LOOK, Finance are onto me because they want to inventorise all the new equipment we bought over lockdown. They believe that there's a serious discrepancy between the number of high value items bought and the number that have made their way back into the workplace. I can't possibly do it as I'm spending most of my week writing off all the equipment people now don't want because it's been replaced by the gear we bought them over lockdown - all before the end of the financial quarter!!! I'm up to my ears in paperwork!\" \n\"It wouldn't surprise me if some of that kit did disappear,\" the PFY says, speaking at the screen over my shoulder. \"We only know what the kit was, we have no idea of who it was delivered to.\" \n\"WHAT?!\" \n\"You authorised the purchases and we tracked down and ordered the kit to the spec you asked for,\" I say. \"It was all delivered here and received by Dave, our stores person, who came in specially. He then despatched those machines to the home addresses of recipients. We actually only ordered about 10 high-end laptops to be delivered directly to the user. But the good news is those 10 machines do have inventory labels on them.\" \n\"I thought you said you didn't have the labels?\" \n\"No, but because they were high-end machines, we were able to get the asset number lasered into them as one of the purchase personalisation options.\" \n\"An asset number from finance?\" \n\"Sadly it was just after that we found out about the whole asset number duplication debacle,\" I say. \n\"So apart from those 10 machines, you don't know where all the other gear went?\" \n\"No, but Dave will know.\" \n\"Dave's not been back to work. He's apparently taken early retirement.\" \nGood man Dave! \n\"So how many machines have made it back to the company?\" I ask. \n\"About 20, last count.\" \nGREAT man Dave! \n\"Has anyone given Dave a call?\" \n\"He's apparently moved to his daughter's place in Spain.\" \nWords fail me. If I did have words, they'd be words like LEGENDARY. \n\"No doubt he retired with quite a tidy nest egg. I wouldn't want to be the person writing those machines off as misplaced!\" \n\"Nor would I!\" the Boss says, oozing relief into his microphone. \n\"Though you were the person who approved the sale of 10 surprisingly new looking - and personalised - 'electronic terminals' for 70p,\" I say. \n\"You can't be serious!\" the Boss blurts. \"You're not serious are you?!

Tensions must run high at times.\" \n\"It's a challenge, but we find it best to bury the hatchet in a lot of cases. Get in early before things get out of hand.\" \n\"An admirable position to take.\" \n\"True enough,\" I reply. \"And oftentimes we find the users that leave us end up becoming an integral part of other companies.\" \n\"Foundation users, you might say,\" the PFY says, no doubt thinking of some of our late-night cement pours. \n\"Other times,\" I add, \"we seem to be the only ones who can see a user's potential and the impact that they might make. Sometimes they don't even know themselves. It's amazing what a difference you can make in their lives with a nudge in the right direction.\" \n\"Some companies would just show them the door,\" the PFY says. \"But that's not our way.\" \n\"Not with a perfectly serviceable window,\" I add. \n… \nA meeting with the Company Insurer is one of those tasks which comes up every couple of years or so, but with the \"newly\" perceived threat of encryption ransomware, the visits have ramped up somewhat and the questions a lot more verbose. \nThat said, the cyber insurance game seems to be a massive rort – with caveats and clauses to shift blame back to the insured in the event of a claim. You're only likely to get a pay-out during an eclipse, when Mercury is in retrograde, your users have no access to the internet AND it's the 30th of February. \nYet even though the payout is less reliable than a VW emissions test, still everyone wants cyber insurance. \n\"Just answer the questions!\" the Boss prompts. \n\"What's next?\" I ask, cheerily. \n\"Can you outline your backup regime?\" \n\"Cloud mirroring, daily snapshots, versioned incrementals.\" \n\"Do you run a hot site?\" \n\"Not since they installed sprinklers,\" the PFY chips in. \nNothing. \n\"No offsite backups or cold sites?\" he continues. \n\"Not really.\" \n\"What about hardware? Do you perform inventory stocktakes?\" he asks. \n\"Been doing that for years,\" I reply, \"usually at night. Sometimes I have to bring a van in.\" \n\"I … uh … mean do you track inventory? Do you erase computers once they're no longer of any use?\" \n\"Computers, phones, people.\" \n\"Uhhhm. What about portable hard drives and personal computers? Do you permit users to bring them in?\" \n\"Strangely, they stopped bringing them in around the same time we started bringing hammers in. It's probably just a coincidence.\" \n\"Remote access. Can people access the work data from home?\" \n\"You … have been around for the past year?\" \n\"Yes, yes, I understand the whole lockdown thing, but I have to ask all the questions on the list – and as I'm new to the company I need to follow the guidelines to the letter.\" \n\"Well you know what they say,\" I chirp, \"you only sell IT insurance twice in your career: once on the way up and once on the way down. So I guess I should say WELCOME BACK!\" \n\"What's your password policy?\" he continues, ignoring me. \n\"Don't ask, don't tell.\" \n\"Sorry?\" \n\"Don't ask us to relax the password policy and we won't tell you to sod off.\" \n\"Have you had any notifiable intrusions in the past?\" \n\"The Boss walked in on me while I was on the toilet last week,\" the PFY says, \"but it was a faulty cubicle latch. At least he said it was a faulty cubicle latch …\" \nThe Boss has the decency to look a little embarrassed while our insurance guy presses on – no doubt making a mental note to ramp up the premium on any personal grievance cover we might have. \n\"Have you or your staff had any loss due to social engineering?\" \n\"No, but we have had a bunch of it due to structural engineering. Apparently our staircases are rather slippery.\" \n\"Any history of workplace bullying, any negative workplace environment complaints or any reason why staff might bear a grudge against you or your computer systems?\" \n\"Well there's a couple of complaints about staff being run down.\" \n\"Staff feeling run-down?\" \n\"No, no, staff being run down. I couldn't find the hatchet,\" the PFY says. \n\"I … uh …\" \n\"Look,\" I say, \"we've all got a job to do. Part of ours is making sure that all our users make the best of our limited resources, and part of yours is making it down that slippery staircase – or the lift with the dodgy brake system. So why don't we just agree that we're an OK risk, that you'll waive the premium this year, and that your impact on the world will be limited to IT insurance planning and not the footpath outside that window?\" \nAnd just like that, we have an agreement which is worth every penny we paid for it. \n"}

I could've got a world record if it hadn't been for that cyclist. \n\"What do you mean, Dick?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Richard,\" Richard says. \n\"Sure.\" \n\"But what are you doing?\" \n\"We're replacing the batteries on this UPS,\" the PFY replies. \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because the old batteries are faulty.\" \n\"Wouldn't it be better to buy a new one?\" \n\"Yes and no, Dick,\" I say. \n\"Richard. And why yes and no?\" \n\"We could get a new one in a couple of days, but it would not be quicker to shut down all the gear connected to the old UPS, and then try to power it all back up again later.\" \n\"So you're putting new batteries into an old UPS instead of using the server room UPS?\" he gasps, spotting a low-hanging efficiency. \n\"Another good question, Dick …\" \n\"Richard.\" \n\"Sure. See, this UPS was built more than 12 years ago when you were starting high school and is a 3-Phase, 3000VA, 'small form factor', rack mount UPS — with hot-swap lead acid batteries. No one makes these any more — or at least makes them this good.\" \n\"I still don't understand why you can't shut everythi—\" \n\"Everything downstream of this is ancient kit has been running LITERALLY for years and CANNOT be powered off. We're talking hard drives with stiction, gear with weird voltage cooling fans that have to be hand spun to boot without a BIOS fault, a BMS which NO-ONE understands and a bloody fax machine which has not received ONE SINGLE FAX FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS BUT WHICH THE CEO HAS INSISTED MUST BE KEPT RUNNING UNTIL WE REPLACE THE CORPORATE STATIONERY.\" \n\"We don't even have the phone line any more,\" the PFY adds. \n\"But I still don't see why it can't be on the main UPS?\" \n\"A) Because of that whole shutdown debacle, but also B) the server room UPS has modern safety features like RCDs and floating earth detection. Ancient pieces of kit, on the other hand, have what you might call a laissez-faire attitude towards safety and will still be delivering uninterrupted voltage long after the ambulance has left and the smell of burnt flesh is finally vented from the room. Clipping the earth leads off our kit and slapping them into an out-of-the-way cabinet that's mounted on a thick rubber blanket was just a belt-and-braces thing.\" \n\"So you're just keeping all the old stuff running?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Why don't you just replace all the old kit?\" \n\"The fear of the unknown,\" I reply. \"That BMS box — no one has a clue about it. Don't know what it does, don't know how it does it. Hell, we don't even know where those 100-core cables out the back of it go. All we know is if it's powered down, the building starts to smell of damp basement and a big fan on the roof starts spinning.\" \n\"And the sewer stops emptying properly,\" the PFY adds. \n\"But surely you could replace it?\" \n\"That's a good suggestion, and one a few people have made in the past — though for most of those people the thought of swimming around in 15,000 litres of human waste is enough to convince them to leave well enough alone. Other people, well, they have to sit the practical exam …\" \n\"Surely you should find out what it does?\" \n\"Again, great point Dick, but I don't think that any living person knows what it all does. Except for the fax machine — we know that does nothing.\" \n\"So you just going to keep it all running?\" \n\"Indeedy,\" I say, as the PFY and I slide the new battery pack into the machine. \"3 … 2 … 1 … >push< >click< >beepbeep!< … And we're done for another couple of years!\" \n\"Don't you see this as an opportunity to upgrade?\" Richard asks. \n\"Ah, youth!\" I say. \"So short on practical experience. I probably have eight to ten more battery changes before I retire, so why rock the boat? Today-Simon says that all problems will be Tomorrow-Simon's problem, and Tomorrow-Simon knows how to fake a workplace accident to get a month off to recuperate.\" \n\"But we could fix things!\" he gasps, pointing to a corner of the server room. \"All those manuals over there, surely one of them documents this stuff.\" \n\"Oh, we've not been over to that part of the room for years!\" I blurt. \n\"But you could find out how to replace all that stuff and free up some time,\" he gasps. \n\"But I like the battery place.

And it’s cold all year round,” the Boss retorts. \n“I’m sure that’s a coincidence,” I say. “But in the meantime, that idea’s still not great. I can’t think of how much it would cost to deploy that much wireless. Then there’s the wireless management system, upgrading the PoE switches, stamp duty …” \n“You seem to be the only one objecting to it,” the Boss counters, ignoring me and nodding at the PFY. \n“Yes, but the only reason he’s not objecting to the idea is because he’s wearing a Stupidity Cancelling Headset.” \n“What?” \n“A Stupidity Cancelling Headset. It’s like a noise cancelling headset which cancels out background sounds that prevent you from hearing voices — only this headset cancels out stupidity and enhances background noises. It’s been shown to reduce annoyance and enable people to focus on tasks.” \n“There’s no such thing!” \n“There is, and the PFY has them. The headphones are tuned to recognise the same micro-stresses that are used in audio-based lie detection, only the headsets are tuned to those frequencies, vocal tics and pauses that reflect indecision, doubt and, uh … lying.” \n“That’s rubbish, I don’t believe you.” \nI turn to the PFY with a raised eyebrow. \n“?” he says, wordlessly. \n“There you go,” I say, turning back to the Boss. \n“He didn’t say anything!” \n“Because he's not heard you — so your speech must be laden with doubt or indecision — or you’re lying.” \n“I doubt that.

You know how light bends around strong gravitational forces? Well idiocy — also called denseness — has a gravitational pull that disturbs the very fabric of reality and which can actually render a person’s stupidity invisible — which accounts for a number of political successes over the past five to ten years. These glasses, however, go the full 100 per cent and remove the idiot as well as their idiocy. They’re a game changer, because they allow people to see past crazy idiots with their crazy ideas.” \nThe Boss, in a surge toward the predictable, grabs a book from my desk and heaves it at the PFY, who deflects it. \n“There! See!” the Boss mugs. \n“See what?” I ask. \n“He saw the book!” \n“The book’s not an idiot. I mean Donald Trump’s autobiography might end up being a bit of an Achilles heel for him, but Kernighan and Ritchie’s treatise on the C Programming Language isn’t likely to be. Even if he couldn’t see that particular book coming he’d know just by sensing a disturbance in the Force when you picked it up.” \n“Did you see that book just fly across the room?” the PFY gasps. \n“Oh this is ridiculous!” the Boss repeats. \n“Who are you talking to?” the PFY asks me. \n“Well there’s one way to prove this,” the Boss says, stomping over to the PFY and raising his fist. \n>OOOF!< \n… \nThe Boss is lying on the ground holding his groin and groaning faintly. \n“Did I forget to tell you about the PFY’s Threat-Detecting Boots?” I ask. \n“This …” he gasps “is actionable.

Like when you're installing some software or another and a window appears with a scrolling box full of text in the background and underneath the box there's a checkbox saying 'I have read and agree to the licence terms and conditions.' You're going to click the box, and you're not going to scroll down and read all that licence palaver.\" \n\"Back in the day it used to say 'I understand and agree to the licence terms and conditions' - but no one really reads the terms so they just dropped the 'understand' bit because it gave them a far stronger legal position,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Yes, but...\" \n\"I mean NO ONE is going to read through all those pages of legalistic bumpf just to install some product that they have no real interest in.\" \n\"OK, but...\" \n\"And they bloody KNOW that no one will read it all, but to make it seem like they WANT you to read it all they'll grey out the Agree button until you've scrolled down to the bottom of the blurb.\" \n\"Uh huh, but I don't know how thi...\" \n\"I mean if they were really SERIOUS about you actually READING the licence conditions there'd be a test at the end,\" I add. \"You know, multichoice like what the fines might be like or what year the law was passed etc.\" \n\"I DON'T CARE!\" the Boss fumes. \"And I don't know what the hell this has to do with the door problem.\" \n\"THE PROBLEM,\" I say, \"is that security now gives new staff 12 pages of instruction on how to use their access card when a 30-second video would be better. More importantly, all the useful information about security is near the end of the instructions when people have stopped reading.\" \nLong story short, the company has had a social engineering security-audit scare. \n\"It's all important information,\" the Boss blurts. \n\"It's not!\" I retort. You present your card, type in your PIN and press the green button - THAT'S IT. What the staff NEED to know is: \n\"They found more issues than that,\" grumbles the Boss. \n\"Yes, yes,\" I reply. \"They told us that our public wireless is less secure than James Dean's seatbelt and that we have no protection against drones spying on us through our unshaded windows. That said, completely changing our security system isn't going to help unless we change the way people use it.\" \n\"The new system is great!\" the Boss burbles. \"It has 1024-bit encryption, biometric measurements with user history and a dashboard on your phone to let you know about security issues.\" \nIn a stunning turn of events, the Boss - a mediocre IT manager at best - has convinced the Board to replace the company security system, triggering the immediate resignation of the Head of Security. \nTo add insult to idiocy, the Boss also convinced the Board he could do both roles until a successor is appointed. \n\"But it will still be used by idiots,\" I say. \"Did you get the contract?\" \n\"Of course,\" the Boss responds. \n\"And read - and understood - it?\" \n\"The company lawyers looked it over before I signed it..\" he mutters. \n\"THIS company's lawyers?\" \n\"They look over all our contracts,\" the Boss says defensively. \n\"They looked over my contract,\" I reply, \"- completely missing the addition of clause 85e about my daily onion bhaji entitlement.\" \n\"Yes.\" the Boss sighs, all too familiar with the after-effects of that. \n\"Or my clause 85e where I get two basement carparks, one in which I can park a van to use for central city storage,\" the PFY adds. \n\"What's your point?\" the Boss snaps. \n\"The POINT is that if you write a document in the right way you can induce licence blindness,\" the PFY replies. \n\"You never put anything controversial in the first half of the document, when people are alert,\" I say. \"And you never put anything dodgy on the last 2-4 pages. But somewhere around 2\/3rds of the way into the document you start putting in clauses that are almost word-for-word copies of clauses on the previous page - but just with tiny changes to justify the additional clauses,\" I say. \nWarming to my theme, I add: Like: you have a set of 10 clauses where you itemise that the client will not reverse-engineer a software product, will not reverse-engineer a hardware product, will not reverse-engineer a firmware product.. etc. THEN you have another set of 10 clauses where the client will not allow others to reverse-engineer etc, etc, and another 10 clauses about always informing the vendor if someone has attempted to reverse-engineer a software product, a hardware product, a firmware product, etc. \n\"Before the reader knows it they're dropping off to sleep and aren't really sure which page they were on before they got drowsy.\" \n\"Yyyyyessss?\" the Boss says uncertainly. \nI continue: \"So they read it again, lose their place - and their will to live - again, then get to a new set of 10 clauses about how the client will, I dunno, pay for the software licence on or before some day; pay for the hardware licence on or before some day; pay for the firmware licence on or before some day. Then get another 10 clauses about how the client will pay interest at the bank rate plus 2 per cent for late payments on the software licence on or before some date; how they will pay interest at the bank rate plus 2 per cent for late payments on or before some date; how they will buy us both new cars on or before some day; how they will not replace the existing security system on or before some future date; how they will reinstate the Head of Security with full backpay on or before some day, etc.\" \n\"Is that what we signed?\" the Boss sighs, having recognised some familiar clauses in my monologue. \n\"Oh yes.\" \n\"So there's no new security system?\" \n\"Oh no.\" \n\"And there was no security audit?\"  \"No. But I will be needing that new car...\" \n\"Actually, we both want vans,\" the PFY adds. ® \n"}

When two or more idiots are gathered together and all that. \n“It’s about the asset register,” the Head Beancounter says. \n“Didn’t we cover this weeks ago?” I ask. \n“I’m not concerned about some missing equipment – I have to report the book value of current assets,” the Head Beancounter says. “We don’t have a clear picture of what equipment the company actually owns because no-one knows exactly what was bought, for whom, and what was disposed of.” \n“No-one really took stock,” the Boss adds. \nI suppress the urge to point out that the PFY and I took a HELL of a lot of stock, and our eBay store can attest to that. \n“We may never fully know what our asset base is,” I say, shaking my head and feigning concern. \n“Yes, that’s the point,” the Head Beancounter says. “We NEED to know. We have to find out exactly what assets we have so as to report a correct figure on the books. 2019–21 were unprecedented financial years and we need to be able to report the true impact financially, as well as working through our assets to see what we need to write down or write off.” \nI suppress the urge to point out that the PFY and I wrote off the company van a few nights ago during a particularly rushed “stock take” and that it’s currently parked in the darkest corner of B2 on top of an ever-widening pool of oil. \n“We think we need an IT inventory,” the Boss says, pausing before adding: “of everything.” \n. . . \nI don’t need to tell you that inventorising our IT assets is a Sisyphean task which would have even the most upbeat of people reaching for a stout cord and a wobbly chair. It’s the sort of poison chalice that tends to get handed to the most annoying of interns in the hopes that they’ll choose to exit the company without a fuss. \n“Mistakes were made,” the Boss continues. “We realise there may have been some undocumented disposals, possibly some shrinkage, and more than likely some assets which were not brought into the asset register in a timely manner.” \n“What gear are we talking about?“ I ask. “The stuff onsite or offsite?” \n“Everything the company purchased between the first of July 2019 and the 31st of June 2021. Plus all assets on the register beforehand, along with all disposals.” \n“So you want someone to check off every IT item in the register?” \n“Yes.” \n“You realise that it’d be cheaper for us to throw away all keyboards and mice because the replacement cost would be less than the labour involved.” \n“That’s not going to work!” the Head Beancounter says. “We have to be able to assure the Board that we have all the equipment we say we have. One of them is talking about random checks.” \n“In circumstances like this I generally choose the road less travelled,” I say. \n“Which is?” \n“Insurance fire. Douse everything in isopropyl and fire starters and set it alight. Tell the Board you were reorganising the whole building to make it more power efficient when the tragedy struck.” \n“You can’t just set fire to your problems!” the Boss snaps, just as the fire alarm starts sounding. \nI resist the urge to dispute the Boss’s point by taking him down to B2 to see a burning van. \nA few days later … \n“They tell me you’ve managed to inventory our items,” the Head Beancounter says, having been let into the server room by the Boss. “How many items did you check off?” \n“All of them,” I respond. “There’s only three items left on the register: the UPS over there, the ancient Building Management server, and the espresso machine in our office – though I think that was misfiled as an IT item.” \n“That’s preposterous! What about that server over there?” \n“It doesn’t have an asset number on it.” \nThe Head Beancounter looks on the front panel, noting a sticky smear around the same size as one of the company’s inventory labels. \n“You must be able to look it up by serial number!” \n“It looks like the serial number has been ground off. Hey, maybe it’s stolen!” \n“What about THAT server then?” \n“Same! In fact, it looks like all our gear must be stolen.” \nThe Head Beancounter realises what the PFY and I realised several years ago – that half an hour with an angle grinder beats a couple of weeks of label checking. He’s a bit shirty, but he recognises an impasse when he sees one. \n“Someone’s got to account for this. We can’t just write off all our IT equipment. The Tax Department wouldn’t buy it for a start.” \n“Sure they would!” I reply. “We’ve got a huge room in the basement crammed full of old IT equipment.” \n“How much equipment?” he asks, seeing a possibility to finesse himself out of a difficult corner. \n… \n“It’s a bit grim,” the Head Beancounter says, once we get down to the basement and switch the lights on to reveal masses of e-waste we’ve stockpiled over the years. \n“And what’s that horrible smell? No-one’s ever going to believe that this kit is … >pop< What happened to the lights?” \nI resist the urge to tell him that the horrible smell is a mixture of tar, isopropyl and diesel as I step back through the door just as he’s reaching for his lighter … \n>SLAM!< \n"}

We still need on-site computing. We'll always need something on site.\" \n\"But it was so much money – and this year we spent even more!!!\" \n\"Yes, we needed to install off-site access last year, but this year we need to replace all the on-site access equipment that we didn't replace last year as well as the on-site equipment we were scheduled to replace this year.\" \n\"I mean, I don't even know what a … uh … mining rig is,\" the Boss blathers. \nI make a mental note to give our supplier a lesson on the dangers of high voltage for not labelling this gear with something more management-acceptable whilst at the same time fabricating a response to the boss's query. \n\"Well as you know, the mining industry has always been at the forefront of computing because of the processing requirements required for seismic surveys, multidimensional array positioning and cross-polar Mandelbrot-Fourier interpolation. So it's pretty much a no-brainer that we should also be using computing of a similar quality.\" \n\"It says 128-bit. Isn't Windows 64-bit?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Yes, yes, but the mining industry realised early that they would need more zeros to count the amount of money they were earning, so they developed an even bigger bit system. And as OUR company has projected a season of post-COVID growth, we thought it prudent to opt for hardware that would keep pace with that growth.\" \n\"Oh. Yes. I see. I suppose. But did we need so many of them?\" \n\"We're hardly going to replace only ONE of our servers are we? No, we'd replace ALL the really important servers with our new technology.\" \n\"And we've got 12 important servers??\" \n\"Actually we wanted 14, but unfortunately our supplier didn't have that many on hand.\" \n\"OK then, but what about all those graphics cards you've been ordering?\" he gasps. \n\"You're the one who wanted full colour pie charts with more detail,\" I say, making yet another mental note to wander around the building uncrippling desktop display settings. \n\"It was so much money,\" he repeats. \n\"Sure – but it's what we have to pay if we want to be up to date.\" \n\"Can I see those servers?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Uh, sure. We can pop into the server room and take a look at them now if you like.\" \nIn my peripheral vision I can see the PFY reaching for the workplace accident report form, but I shake my head slightly and take the Boss into the server room. \n\"There,\" I say, opening the door and gesturing into the room. \n\"WHERE?\" the Boss asks, over the whine of the process chillers. \n\"THERE, THERE, THERE, THERE, AND A COUPLE OVER THERE, SOME OVER THERE AND, OH, THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.\" \nI'm gesturing vaguely around the room pointing at equipment with which the Boss is completely unfamiliar, having no real history in the IT business at all. As long as I don't point at anything that might at one time have run Lotus 1-2-3, I'm fairly sure it'll be new-to-him. \n\"OH,\" the boss blurts, disappointedly. \n\"OH?\" \n\"I DON'T KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT THEY'D LOOK NEWER,\" he says, looking through a rack door grill at a ProLiant 6500 which has been out of service for more than ten years and is only in the rack because we cross-threaded the mounting bolts and can't get it out. \n\"AND …\" he continues, looking around in a slightly confused manner. \n\"AND?\" \n\"DIDN'T THIS ROOM USED TO BE BIGGER?\" \n\"Bigger?\" I say, as we step out of the room. \"How could it possibly have been bigger?\" \n\"Oh, I don't know,\" he says, admitting defeat. Which is a much better response than: \"So you didn't build a false wall to hide a couple of racks of Bitcoin mining servers, drill a hole through the ceiling to steal power from the Beancounter department so it wouldn't show up on our meter, and vent the excess heat into the main office ceiling space?\" \n\"It could be worse, I suppose,\" the Boss admits. \"I was talking to the head of Accounting this morning and apparently their power consumption has almost doubled since they came back.\" \nI make a mental note to drill a hole in the Beancounter's ceiling to spread the power over another floor. \nAnd they say computing's getting more expensive … \n"}

I only noticed it when I was doing an audit. It's illegal even to have it.\" \n\"Maybe records got lost?\" I suggest. \"And we hardly ever look at the bottles so I guess we just forgot they were there. Someone should have said something.\" \nAnd so it is that our halon system is to be decommissioned. One of the last vestiges of \"Computing as it was,\" it too has to be replaced. \n\"What will we replace it with?\" I ask the Boss. \n\"Do we even NEED fire suppression with all our data in the cloud?\" \n\"With SOME of our data in the cloud, of course we do. But which system to use?\" \n\"There are other options to consider,\" the engineer says. \"Some places use water – with the problems that can cause with electronic equipment, some use CO 2 – though obviously there's still the issue of thermal shock from the ultra-cool CO 2 entering a room. Then there are other inert gases – each with their own problems, but they all have the thermal shock consideration.\" \n\"What about if we ran the room as a permanent CO 2 environment?\" I ask. \n\"It could work, though there are a number of safety issues which would need to be worked through.\" \n\"Yes, yes, but the room's pretty much an airlock now as there's only a tiny amount of introduced air – the rest is recirculated. And the room is already designed to be an airlock because of the halon. In the event of a fire the make-up air vent shutters trip and the room is sealed up like a drum. We could just trip them and recirculate CO 2 .\" \n\"ARE YOU PROPOSING TO HAVE A ROOM FULL OF CO 2 !!!!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It's not the stupidest idea I've heard,\" the engineer says. \"I mean obviously you'd need a vented airlock, breathing apparatus, appropriate signage, but it could be done.\" \n\"WHA—\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It's an unusual situation but it would definitely work. It's not what's known as a 'Preferred Solution' but it would fall under the realm of 'Acceptable Engineered Solutions' – with the appropriate safeguards of course.\" \n\"But it would be cheaper to run, wouldn't it?\" \n\"I guess once you had your initial charge you could just top the system up from an airlock,\" the engineer says, thinking furiously. \"But you'd completely eliminate the thermal shock situation – and with high CO 2 presence fires wouldn't even start in the first place.\" \n\"So it's decided!\" I blurt. \n\"NO IT'S NOT!\" the Boss snaps. \"No one's bloody decided anything! We're not going to fill the building up with carbon dioxide!\" \n\"We're not talking about the building, we're only talking about the server room – and it's completely sealed!\" \n\"You could use nitrogen for that matter,\" the engineer says, thinking some more. \"I mean air's 80 per cent nitrogen anyway. You could put a nitrogen generator on the roof and just pipe nitrogen into the room. No bottles, nothing. And you'd just vent the excess nitrogen back to the atmosphere on the roof. It would be even cheaper than CO 2 .\" \n\"So it's DECIDED!\" I say. \n\"IT'S NOT BLOODY DECIDED!\" the Boss snaps again. \"What about health and safety?\" \n\"It's a locked environment,\" I say to the fire engineer. There's only two people that have access any more, plus an emergency card. \n\"You'd need a rescue plan to outline what would happen if someone got trapped in the room or their air supply ran out,\" the engineer says. \n\"Simple!\" I say. \"We just change the HALON HOLD-OFF button to a PURGE button. If there was an emergency you could just hit the purge button and a fan would pump air into the room.\" \n\"Well I guess that would work – but I'd have to calculate maximum travel distances to the purge buttons – and you'd probably need to install several extra buttons.\" \n\"A piece of the proverbial!\" the PFY says. \n\"So it's DECIDED!\" I blurt. \n\"NOTHING IS DECIDED!\" the Boss snaps yet again. \n\"I would like it noted in your records that we tried to assist you in the removal of the halon system but HE was against it,\" I say to the engineer. \n\"I'm not against it, I just want a proper solution.\" \n\"That nitrogen environment is unusual, but it would definitely work. And if the room's airtight – which we'll obviously verify for ourselves – I think it's a workable solution. And very cost-effective.\" \n\"But you can squander the Company's money if you like,\" I suggest slyly to the Boss. \n… Two weeks later … \n\"And there we go,\" I say to the Boss. \"A nitrogen environment. Well, when I say nitrogen I mean mostly nitrogen. It turns out that by taking less than ten per cent of the oxygen out of the air you effectively prevent combustion.\" \n\"And that's nitrogen in there, is it?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Mostly.\" \nThe Boss isn't totally convinced. Even with the removal of all the bottles and the eye-watering halon disposal fee, he still thinks that somehow we're up to something. \n\"So if I went in there without breathing gear …\" \n\"You'd probably pass out not long after you went in – unless you purged the system.\" \nI can see the Boss has his suspicions, but he doesn't have the bottle to try it for himself. He decides to leave it and wanders off. \n\"He'll be back,\" the PFY says. \"Most likely with someone who'll say a nitrogen environment is reckless.\" \n\"You're right,\" I say, reaching for the drill. \"Best I fireproof his office too.\" ® \n"}

Did this Company-wide encryption\/infection happen BEFORE or AFTER this expert came to the building?\" \n\"Oh, it was probably before.\" \n\"Probably. So he was ON the premises when the infection or whatever it was started happening.\" \n\"Well, I don't know if we can be SURE about that.

I mean, who can be sure?\" \n\"So why was this … expert … here in the first place?\" \n\"He was visiting one of his friends in the accounting department when everything went awry and he was able to put his skills to good use.\" \n\"His skills?\" \n\"He's got a Masters degree in computer usability and a Doctorate in divinity.\" \n\"Ah, two degrees that are worth less than their weight in bog paper.

We need to zero everything,\" I say. \nI fill the PFY in on everything that has transpired in the past 24 hours, including how Jim's rampage through our hardware has effectively screwed the entire Company over – including our machines. A worryingly prominent vein appears on the PFY's reddening forehead as I recount how the contents of his machine, including his tirelessly pirated MAME archive and savegames, as well as his personal data, are now gone. \n\"I have a set of backups,\" the PFY says, after only a couple of minutes of eerie silence. \"Two weeks old. At home. I'll go and get them now.\" \nAs the PFY walks off calmly to the tube station, the Boss asks if it's alright if Jim pops in later to apologise.

In this case, 'not financially thoughtful'","Link":"\/2021\/08\/13\/bofh_2021_episode_15\/","Content":"Episode 15 \"These NFT things,\" the Boss says, attempting a smooth segue from our topic to his favourite – how to make cash with no effort. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"What are they exactly?\" \n\"Non-Fungible Tokens.\" \n\"Yes, I know that, but what does it mean?\" \n\"I think the main thing is that it's non-fungible.\" \n\"You can't funge with it,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Yes, but what does it mean?\" \n\"It basically means something that is totally unique.\" \n\"Like one of your good ideas,\" the PFY adds. \n\"But it's not exchangeable,\" I chip in. \n\"I'm not sure I follow,\" the Boss says. \n\"When we talk about fungibility, people mostly mention things like cash. Like you could pay your subscription to Trainspotter's Weekly with a ten-quid note, but you can pay it with ANY ten-quid note. If it were a non-fungible item, it would be only ONE particular note.\" \n\"And then someone might come along and tell you it was worth 2000 quid because it was the only note that you used to pay that bill.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"So let's use the PFY's example of your good idea,\" I say. \"If someone were collecting your good ideas – obviously they'd be next to worthless …\" \n\"… like the ideas themselves,\" the PFY adds. \n\"However, if TWO people were collecting your good ideas then each good idea would have some value, which would be negotiated by what those two people were willing to pay. Now, while one of your good ideas is rare enough anyway, it's also effectively non-fungible because you can't just swap it for another idea. So you could create an NFT of one of your good ideas – then it would still be worth next to nothing BUT you have effectively rubber-stamped it as a digital asset.\" \n\"So the buyer would own my idea?\" \n\"Maybe. Maybe they'd own the idea, maybe they'd own the token. Or maybe they'd own both – it's up to you what you're selling.\" \n\"I don't understand how this works.\" \n\"OK, so an NFT is either something that HAS value. Maybe a software licence for instance – completely unique and issued as such. Or it's something that someone TELLS you has value, but doesn't – like an SCO licence. But there's always some cretin in the background thinking they can make a pile of cash for it and insisting that you could too.\" \n\"For instance,\" the PFY says, \"you could just pile a bunch of cash up and burn it, take a photo of the ash and create an NFT of that image, and sell that for more than the original money was worth.\" \n\"Would that work?\" \n\"Probably.\" \n\"How much money do you think you'd need to burn?\" \n\"You'd probably need to burn a significant amount for it to have a significant value. I mean anyone could burn 50 quid, and if it didn't sell as an NFT it wouldn't be a huge loss. To be worth big money though, you'd probably need to be the first person to do it – because copies are never worth as much as the original. The first one would always be the first, and as such would have a higher value than the rest.\" \n\"So what, 1000 quid?\" he gasps. \n\"At the very least. I mean if you were a professional artist it would probably be 10,000 quid or more – because it's the first, a big statement and all that.\" \n\"So a couple of thousand for a non-artist?\" \n\"Probably.\" \n\"How would someone know that it was really 2000 quid and not just some newspaper?\" \n\"I guess you'd need to take photos along the way as it burns.\" \n\"Could each image be an NFT?\" \n\"YES THEY COULD!\" the PFY says. \"And there's a good idea you can sell as well!\" \n\"Which image would be worth the most?\" \n\"That's hard to say because I think the market would decide – by which time you may have already sold the NFT that goes on to be the most valuable.\" \n\"So how do people know?\" \n\"They don't. So you sell your ash picture to A for 2500 quid, they sell it to B for 5000 quid a few weeks later and in two years' time B sells it to C for 147,000 quid.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Unless the arse falls out of the market when B realises they paid 5000 quid for a photo of ash that no one gives a shit about. But hey – that's not your problem because you already made your money.\" \n\"So what's the best option?\" \n\"If it were me, I'd sell the intermediate burning image NFTs first and then sell the ash picture last – to build up interest. And, of course, value.\" \n… \n\"So you're ready?\" the Boss asks nervously, as he pours lighter fluid on a pile of crumpled Turings. \n\"Yep!\" the PFY says, holding up the camera – as the Boss wants to be in the photo for provenance reasons. \n\"OK, GO!\" the Boss says, lighting the cash and stepping back. \n>click< >click< >click< >click< \n\"How was that?\" the Boss asks, peering over the PFY's shoulder at the camera screen. \n\"Artistically it was amazing!!!\" the PFY says. \n\"Let's have a look then.\" \n\"Oh, well, that's the thing. Artistically it was amazing. Digitally, it would have been a lot better if the card hadn't got corrupted. But on the bright side you've still got that wadge of gluey plastic which we can take a photo of with a new card …\" \n\"Unless the new card is funged as well …\" I add. \"Hey! Maybe I could tape your whimpering and we could make an NFT out of that!!!\" ® \n"}

It's a real social occasion and we're seeing people we've not seen in many years. \n\"See that guy?\" I say to the PFY, pointing out a bloke in the distance. \"He's the one who designed the algorithm for mistyping on phone touch screens.\" \n\"The one …\" \n\"Yeah, the one that chooses 'a' instead of 's' four times in a row before finally letting you touch 's'. It does some on-the-fly math to keep you precisely on the verge of a mental breakdown. Apparently later versions use the phone microphone to detect swearing and have some measurement from the screen to detect increasing sweat levels. Anyway, he's talking to the bloke that wrote the code to re-'predictive text' words after you press send.\" \n\"That shithead!\" \n\"I think you mean chairperson.\" \n\"No, I mean shithead.\" \n\"I think you mean chairperson.\" \n\"NO, I MEA— oh, I see what you're doing.\" \n\"And him,\" I say, pointing to a figure in the distance. \n\"The bloke with the funny teeth?\" \n\"Yes. He's the one who developed the Windows 10 update process timing to shut down your machine just when you're in the middle of something important.\" \n\"Oh, I'd like to …\" \n\"Several people have, which is how his teeth got that way.\" \n\"So we're in a collection of the IT greats then?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Not just IT greats. The weedy bloke over in the far corner …\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"He's in adhesives. His team developed the packing tape that won't stick to a parcel for more than 30 minutes but will stick to your shoe like it's been welded on. He also made that easy-release double-sided tape which will either fall off in ten minutes or take half the wall off when you come to try and remove it. He's got a linked patent on that.\" \n\"A linked patent?\" \n\"Yeah, it's a patent tied to a proper patent which describes what the product will actually do, not what the patent says it will do. Like one on those touch-free bathroom hand dryers outlining how they ensure that the users HAVE to touch them multiple times just to get them to operate.\" \n\"So it's industry greats then?\" the PFY asks. \n\"And cross-industry too. That bloke over there is a consultant who co-ordinates power adapter design so that no two adapters are ever the same size, ensuring that not even a Tetris master can plug them into a multi-box without clashes.\" \nOur conversation is interrupted by the start of ceremonies. \nAfter a light meal and some heavy lagers I'm invited up for the keynote address. \n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" I say. \"I'm here today to unveil a multi-layered technology that is already known to some, but has till now been mislabelled. I'd like to introduce you to The Internet of Useless Things.\" \nThere's a couple of murmurs from the audience, but most of the rest lean forward to hear more. \n\"Behold!\" I say. \"A device which will tell you whether you're running low on milk in your fridge! Now in the past we might have called this a door, but now we have a layered set of technologies which can do this for you and send the answer to your mobile phone.\" \nMore murmurs. \nI know what you're thinking: 'But my phone is on the kitchen counter, right next to the fridge and my smartwatch is still on the shelf by the shower and here I am on the sofa – whatever am I to do?' \n\"And that's where we come in. We have a device which will pair with your phone and will send a message to an LCD panel in front of one of your security cameras outside which will then be visible when you flick your smart TV over to your security channel.\" \nConfused murmurs. \n\"And here is a mood lamp. This lamp will change colour to denote the secondary user's mood to the primary user. In the olden days you would need to establish this with long-winded and convoluted conversation involving problematic communication cues – however you can now tell at a glance how likely it is that you will be murdered in your sleep.\" \nLouder murmurs. \n\"We also have a smart mirror which will tell you in real time, the time, weather and the outside air temperature. In the old days we'd call that a window with a thermometer outside but we've streamlined that with a device that uses 140 watts of power 24x7, even though you only look at it for about five seconds a day. It also comes with a device that periodically crashes, needs plugging into the wall somewhere, needs a debug port and occasionally changes your geographic location to Harare.\" \nLouder confused murmurs. \n\"But not all our devices are totally useless. Our latest GPS implementation will eliminate the need for a travelling companion. It will shout at you as you approach an intersection if you don't look like you're taking the correct turnoff. It will repeatedly tell you you're going the wrong way until at some random point it will tell you that you can have it your own way, after which it will lapse into an uncomfortable silence and then – when you reach your destination two and a half hours late – it will look back through your partner's social media relationship history, and just as you turn your vehicle off, whisper, 'I knew I should have married Peter'.\" \nLouder, less confused murmurs. \n\"And where can you lay your hands on this useless technology, I hear you ask? We're releasing a range of solution-looking-for-a-problem items to crowdfunding sites – although we appear to have some stiff competition there. Any questions?\" \nA hand goes up. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"Who'd be stupid enough to buy one of these gadgets?\" \n\"I'm glad you asked,\" I say, opening a screen to show the view out of the Boss's smart mirror. \"Let's meet the man himself …\" \n"}

It'll be a toaster or a sandwich press …\" the PFY replies. \n\"OR,\" I interrupt, \"maybe there's a new sort of toasty cooker which only makes organic, vegan, gluten-free bread rolls.\" \n\"For CrossFit people,\" the PFY adds, finishing the virtue-signalling quadfecta. \n\"I'm not with you,\" the Boss says. \"Surely it's a piece of equipment that caught fire?\" \n\"Nah, that doesn't happen much anymore,\" I say. Back in the day you'd see smoke from a paper jam in the fuser unit of a laser printer or maybe some carpet burns from a power cable mashed too many times by a wheelie chair, but kit's fairly robust now. If it's going to catch fire it usually does it early in the morning when it's first turned on or later in the afternoon when it's been running too long – but not mid-morning. \n\"This is the time of day when those people who like to run to work are having their post-shower grilled bagel with nut butter and ethically produced free-range honey.\" \n\"Followed by a stove-top espresso cooked on a camp sto— It's the camp stove!\" the PFY exclaims. \nIn the end we were both wrong, but at least we got the genre correct. A \"YouTube Content Creator\" from the coloured pencil office was giving his workmates a practical demonstration on how to roast coffee beans in a popcorn maker – a process which gives off roughly the same amount of smoke as a dumpster fire. \nAnd the rest is history. \nThe Boss isn't pleased because he was in the middle of some conference call and lacked the technical wherewithal to find the link and continue the call on his mobile. \nAn edict comes from above about unapproved electrical appliances in the building, which is never going to go down well. About one in five desks has a pod coffee maker of some description which the owner treasures more than any family member, and the number of illicit heaters in winter is truly astounding. \nIn situations like this there's always one steaming turd in the office who's ready and willing to float to the top of the cess pond and volunteer for the position of Appliance-Finder General – given the breathtaking amount of power to search and seize that the role has to offer. In our case it's Steve, a bloke from the coloured pencil office with a solid reputation for work avoidance. \nIt doesn't take him long to ooze over to Mission Control – no doubt sensing some low-hanging fruit in an office crammed with electrical gear. \n\"So none of this is personal stuff?\" he asks. \n\"Nope, all company equipment,\" I respond, hand on heart. \n\"So that expresso machine?\" \n\"The ESPRESSO machine is company property,\" I nod. \n\"So why's it here and not out in the main office?\" he asks. \n\"It's the long hours we work,\" the PFY lies. \"When you're pulling an all-nighter to recover some hysteresis data from the redundant database shadow journal you're not going to want to pause the backwriting of the log buffers just so you can pop down to Soho for a ristretto.\" \n\"I … see. But what about that huge home theatre system,\" he points. \n\"That's a huge system monitoring interface.\" \n\"It's got a … 1500-watt amplifier!\" Steve counters. \n\"So we can hear system alerts without them being drowned out by office noise.\" \n\"There's two electric armchairs and a small fridge in front of it!\" \n\"We need to sit somewhere when we're monitoring the systems!\" I blurt. \"We can't be standing all day!\" \n\"What about THAT?\" he asks. \"Is that a company appliance?\" \nHe's gesturing at the Defender arcade machine that the PFY bought several years ago, played twice then lost interest after it turned itself off in the middle of a game. \n\"Yes,\" the PFY lies. \"It's from the cafeteria. It … uh … broke down a few years back and I … offered to fix it. I'm waiting on parts, but you know, with COVID and supply chains and everything …\" \n\"I don't think it is a company appliance. In fact, I don't think anything I've asked about is a company appliance – and I'm willing to bet that if I asked the Finance department about it they'd say none of this stuff is even on the asset register!\" \n\"And that's where you're wrong,\" the PFY says triumphantly, standing up and pointing to the bottom corner of the arcade machine. \"Behold, a genuine company asset tag.\" \n\"Where?\" Steve asks, stooping to inspect the aforementioned tag. \n\"Right at the bottom,\" the PFY points again. \n\"I can't see …\" \n>HEAVE< \n>CRUNCH< \n\"Hey, look at that!\" the PFY says, as the machine turns on. \"It must have just been the thermal cut-out!\" \n\"Speaking of thermal,\" I say, \"can you smell smoke?\" \n\"As it happens,\" the PFY says, watching a wisp of grey curl its way from Steve's location under the machine. \n\"Right – best slap an asset tag on it before the alarms go off then. I'm sure we'll lose the records of it in the fire, though …\" ® \n"}

Us.","Link":"\/2021\/10\/08\/bofh_2021_episode_18\/","Content":"Episode 18 A lesson I learned a long time ago was: never let a user buy a server. \nIt's not a hard lesson to remember because of the frequent booster-shots for the rule whenever some purchasing person decides to sidestep their purchasing restrictions by \"renaming\" what they're buying. \n… \nSo we've got this crappy black-box device which does pretty much nothing but provide random 24-digit numbers (as best as I can tell) to the beancounters as some way of validating transactions and preventing fraud. \nIt looks like a 1RU server, sounds like a 1RU server, but is in fact a \"key-validation-device\" – a \"device\" that didn't require any IT oversight in the purchasing process. \nI don't know a hell of a lot about what it does, as it simply has a network port and a power lead out the back and a single USB-C port, a power switch and a multicolour LED out the front. \nI'm guessing it has some specialised USB interface for input and output but frankly I'm not overly interested. \nIt just appeared one day in the arms of a Beancounter, preconfigured with a static IP address on the Beancounter VLAN and instructions on a firewall pinhole it required to operate. \nAnyway, back to the device. \nThe multicolour LED, which is normally blinking orange when it's booting and a solid green when it's up, is now showing a solid red – and the network interface is showing as down on the switch. \nAPPARENTLY, there's a minor panic at Beancounter Central because all sorts of transactions are being invalidated and\/or cancelled a minute after they're initiated. \n\"But that shouldn't matter,\" I say, \"after all, this is a test device. You know, so you can test a system to see if it's stable enough to put into production.\" \n\"Uh …\" \n\"That's what you told me. You said it was just a test device and that you wanted to see if it would be something that might be worth implementing in the future, when you had thoroughly tested it.\" \n\"Uh …\" \n\"I mean, no-one would put a test machine into production without telling us. That would be madness. I mean, for a start we'd recommend buying a machine with redundant power.\" \n\"And redundant drives,\" the PFY adds. \n\"We might even suggest you got one of those motherboards that lights up an LED next to a faulty RAM bank – even though that's a complete white elephant, hardware-wise.\" \n\"So it's not production?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Uh … … no …\" the Beancounter lies. \n\"Well that's lucky. Because if it were production … heads would probably roll,\" I chip in. \n\"Not your head though,\" the PFY says. \"Because it's not production. Because you would have told us.\" \n\"Shouldn't we call an engineer?\" he asks. \n\"Oh, there's no need to rush,\" I say, \"because it's not production. Anyway, I can still hear the hard drive whirring.\" \n\"Still …\" the Beancounter hesitates. \"Maybe give them a ring. Maybe they're in the area. It comes with a warranty.\" \n\"Yes,\" I say, looking at a small sticker on the top: \"A 24x7 3yearr NBD. You know what NBD means?\" \n\"?\" \n\"Next Business Day,\" I say. \n\"And that's just how long it takes them to answer the phone,\" the PFY adds. \n\"See, a hardware warranty has a lot of similarities to an insurance policy and if there's one thing those industries are good at, it's loopholes,\" he continues. \n\"So the clock doesn't start ticking on your support contract till they pick up the phone. And it's Friday lunchtime now, so I'm guessing they'll be picking the receiver up some time late Tuesday morning.\" \n\"If we call now,\" I add. \n\"And THEN they'll send out the dumbest engineer in the crew who's so useless that he only has two tools – a rubber mallet and a Bible – with the instruction that if the Bible doesn't work he's to hit himself with the mallet.\" \n\"Yes, but maybe we should still call …\" \nThree minutes later … \n\"Number 85 in the queue isn't bad,\" the PFY says, listening in to the Beancounter's phone. \n\"It's only a 40-minute wait time,\" he says happily. \n\"Yes,\" the PFY says darkly. \"That's how they get you. Forty minutes now, then two songs, a message about how important your call is and how they have an unprecedented volume of callers at the moment, then your time's extended to 60 minutes, then two more songs, a message about using their web site, then your time's extended to 85 minutes, two more songs, a message, two hours and ten minutes …\" \nLuckily the PFY pulled out of that particular nose dive as I'd left my Bible at home – but I do have a rubber mallet. \n\"So what do we do?\" the Beancounter asks. \n\"Would you like us to take a look at it?\" I ask. \n\"Could you?\" he asks, gushing with relief. \n\"No. Because I'm starting to suspect it's a production machine – and I'd need to do a change control.\" \n\"IT'S NOT PRODUCTION!\" he snaps back with some urgency. \n\"OK then – well it's a tricky one,\" I say. \"See these? They're security torx screws. For security. I mean they don't just put security torx drivers in EVERY SINGLE COMBINATION SET YOU BUY AT A POUND SHOP. Because they're security screws. Two on the front panel and four in the top.\" \n\"Can you undo them?\" \n\"Yeah sure,\" the PFY says, rolling his eyes. \"That's just what they'd WANT you to do. This is a financial security device right?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"So what's the bet that they're not security torx at all, but are tamper switches. You turn them and they Mission-Impossible-Self-Destruct the contents of the server to protect the security.\" \n\"I … so … what do you do?\" \n\"You drill a small inspection hole and poke a flexible boroscope down there to take a look.\" \n\"Do you have a boroscope?\" \n\"Sure,\" I respond, \"and we have a drill too. How big a hole would be need in the lid for the boroscope?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"16mm, but we don't have one.\" \n\"OK, what's the next size we do have?\" \n\"20mm.\" \n\"That'll have to do then.\" \nFive minutes later … \n\"Honestly, who could have guessed that boron-coated drill would have gone straight through the lid, the hard drive and the bottom of the server,\" I ask. \n\"Lucky it wasn't production,\" the PFY says. \"That would have been bad.\" \n\"Heads would have rolled,\" I add. \nThe only light at the end of that tunnel comes just as the Beancounter's about to pass out. He hears a tiny voice from the phone asking for a service contract number. \nI might need that mallet after all. \n"}

But we need to make a compelling case to your department head, so how comparatively slow is it in third-world terms?\" \n\"Third-world terms?\" \n\"Yeah, you know, like the machines we send to the third world, pretending we're doing them a favour by giving them useful machines instead of what we're really doing – dumping our toxic waste on them.\" \n\"Oh, it's slow.\" \n\"OK, second hurdle down. Now all we need to do is cross the budget hurdles and we're home free.\" \n\"Budget hurdles?\" \n\"Yeah, all our departments should have a budget to replace desktop machines so you have three hurdles to clear to get access to it: 1. Does your department have a budget (as opposed to thinking they can skip desktop replacement this year)? 2. How much is left in the budget to buy your machine? And finally, 3. How many people higher up in the food chain than you want their machines replaced too?\" \n\"Then there's the rolldown factor,\" the PFY adds from across the room. \n\"What was that?\" the user asks. \n\"The rolldown factor,\" I say. \"If someone higher up in the food chain than you wants a new machine (even if they don't need one) they might suggest that their old machine would be a perfect replacement for you, so they'll replace THEIR one and give you their old one full of the three Ds.\" \n\"The three Ds?\" \n\"Dirt, Dandruff and Donkey porn. Typically, when you get an old machine it's not very well cleaned – physically or data-wise, so you're left with something that could put you in hospital, the unemployment queue or prison. So we try to avoid the rolldown wherever possible.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"We make your case for replacement compelling by introducing criteria that can't be met by a rolldown.

There's plenty of air thieves above you in that particular food chain.\" \n\"I'm a product developer!\" \n\"So would you need a special card to access special equipment?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"What about a resource requirement that's unlikely to be compatible in a rolldown machine? I'm talking 12TB RAID6 array with 64 gig of memory.\" \n\"No, just a normal machine that can run Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint.\" \n\"You're not giving me much room to manoeuvre here, so I think we'll need to go with equipment failure.\" \n\"There's nothing wrong with it. It's just slow.\" \n\"No, I think you'll find it's noisy.

See the key is to have a plausible excuse for the damage. The more plausible, the more likely you are to get that replacement.\" \n\"OK, well, I'll have to think about it.\" \nTen minutes later, a rather large tower whooshes past the windows at Mission Control, followed by a mouse, a keyboard, and a manky LCD monitor. A desk follows half a minute later, then a wheelie chair and a desk phone. \n>ring< \n\"Hi there,\" I say. \"So you took my advice.\" \n\"I certainly did.\" \n\"And what excuse did you use?\" \n\"I told people you did it.\" \nWell, it's plausible. ® \n"}

I've ever met you,\" Shannon says. \n\"Well I'm not from your I.T. department.\" \n\"Sorry?\" Shannon asks, even more confused than before. \n\"I'm one of your clients. I was asking you for information on the warranty on some hardware of ours because no one had turned up inside the contracted service period. I gave our reception a call on the way up in the lift and they told me there's still no sign of anyone.\" \n\"I..\" \n\"And when I called you yesterday you said you'd call me back within the hour – but you didn't – so I thought it was probably that same desktop problem that you were talking about this morning.\" \n\"We have our own in-house people,\" Shannon says. \"We're a service provider.\"  \"Might I suggest you just truncate that to 'service' and drop the whole 'provider' bit - just to keep you safe from some sort of false advertising scenario.\" \n\"I don't see...\" \n\"Anyway,\" I continue, \"as I said I thought I'd pop over and take a look at your desktop because if we're not seeing your engineers (and we have a guaranteed service window contract), then you – probably with no contract at all, being an internal user – are probably even less likely to get your desktop issue sorted out.\" \n\"I don't have a desktop issue,\" Shannon repeats again. \n\"You must do, because this morning when I rang to complain you said you couldn't bring up our contract details because you had a desktop issue. Then you said that you couldn't give me a timeframe for the repair because you couldn't open a new job without my client code. And not our actual client code, but an internal client code which we wouldn't have – because it's internal.\" \nShannon has decided that silence may be his best option. \n\"So I thought it's probably quickest for us both if I come over and take a look.\" \n\"I don't think...\" \n\"Don't worry – I'll be at least as professional as your engineers. And by as professional as your engineers I mean the guy who showed up three days ago to swap out a failed drive, put the replacement drive in the tray the wrong way around and then rammed it repeatedly into the slot to try and get it installed – smashing the connector and shorting some of the connector pins together.\"  \"I... wasn't aware of...\" \n\"Sure you were. I talked to you about this yesterday because your engineer said he'd be back yesterday with a replacement cable loom – only...\" \n\"Look,\" Shannon says, trying to wrest control of this conversation from me. \"I'm sure that there's a reasonable explanation for all this – a supply-chain issue, or..\" \n\"But you said this morning that it was a desktop issue.\" \n\"Well I'm sure at the time I was having some sort of issue, but my desktop is working fine now.\" \n\"Are you sure? Only I've got three different-sized hammers here...\" I say, pointing at toolbox. \"I also have a 1\/2 gallon jar of petrol – which probably has a street value higher than your desktop machine at the moment – also a tin of homemade thermite as well as a reciprocating saw with some sort of organic staining splashed all over it.\" \n\"I..\" \n\"Does this carpet pull up?\" I ask. \n\"LOOK\" Shannon says. \"There's nothing wrong with my machine. If there was I'd definitely be having one of our in house people take a look at it, simply to protect information we'd consider commercially sensitive.\" \n\"And by commercially sensitive information I'm assuming you're talking about a manila folder in your top drawer with the label 'How shit we are'?\" I ask. \n\"Our commercial information,\" Shannon says angrily, \"is none of your concern.

But even the PFY will admit there's a limit, and at lunch today we think we found it ... \n\"So let me get this straight,\" I say. \"The vaccine contains tiny … robots …\" \n\"Nanobots,\" the bloke across the table from me chips in. \n\"Nanobots. Right,\" I say, \"and these nanobots are …\" \n\"What size are they?\" the PFY asks. \"The nanobots? Only the needle they use for the vax was pretty small.\" \n\"They're tiny. They're almost invisible to the naked eye,\" he says. \n\"Right,\" the PFY nods. \"Who manufactures them?\" \n\"Big Data,\" the bloke responds all-knowingly. \n\"OK. So Big Data's manufacturing these nanobots which are very tiny. And what, they distribute them to all the vaccine companies for inclusion in their vaccines? Or do they just do it at the doctor level – you know, backroom deals, kickbacks, that sort of thing?\" \n\"Well, I don't know the nuts and bolts of it but the doctors will be in on it. And the government.\" \n\"Let's just park that 'sea of doctors' and 'government' bus for a few minutes and get back to these nanobots,\" I say. \"How are these things powered?\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"What powers them – to do what they do?\" \n\"They've got tiny batteries.\" \n\"And what charges these batteries?\" \n\"Radio waves,\" he replies, again nodding in an omniscient manner. \n\"5G?\" the PFY asks – at which point I feel the urge to object that he's leading the witness. However, I plough on. \n\"So that would mean fractional amounts of power, as 5G is pretty low-power itself.\" \n\"And Wi-Fi,\" the bloke adds. \n\"Ah, now we're talking – because Wi-Fi is everywhere.\" \n\"And GPS signals.\" \n\"What about AM radio?\" the PFY asks. \"And LoRa?\" \n\"Them too,\" he nods. \n\"What about the global wireless nanomesh?\" I suggest. \n\"What?\" he asks, confused by a term that's not appeared in his online group. \n\"Uh … nothing,\" I say – ensuring that it very soon will. \n\"OK, so nanobots, wirelessly charged by various radio waves – and 5G, the bastards. And who's behind it?\" \n\"Big Data.\" \n\"Yes, you said that, but they're the manufacturers of the equipment. Who's actually behind it all?\" \n\"International Bad Actors.\" \n\"NICOLAS CAGE AND STEPHEN SEAGAL ARE BEHIND IT!?!?!\" I gasp. \n\"No, like … governments.\" \n\"Which governments?\" \n\"ALL governments.\" \n\"OK, I think we're getting there. So you're saying that governments – like the ones that can't agree on a trade tariff system, a single currency or even a measurement system – are behind all this?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"OK. Now … why?\" \n\"To track us all.\" \n\"Wouldn't they just pay Google and Apple to do that for them, given they're collecting the data anyway?\" the PFY asks. \nI fear we may be drifting into the PFY's own personal minefield of paranoia. However, it's important to push forward. \n\"And what will they be doing with all this data?\" \n\"Well, tracking us!\" \n\"Yes, yes, but surely they're tracking us for a reason. I mean they must be DOING something with the data if they're collecting it.\" \n\"They're collecting it for future analysis,\" he says, seemingly relieved to have formulated a plausible answer. \n\"Right, so … nothing at the moment?\" \n\"No, but we know they use nanobots for mind control. They've been doing it for years. They've been planning all of this for years.\" \nAh, the old mind-control chestnut. \n\"But surely,\" I say, \"if they're using it for mind control, you wouldn't be saying this right now? Surely the nanobots would have suppressed this?\" \n\"I've not had the vaccine!\" he blurts. \n\"Or MAYBE … you just THINK you've not had the vaccine,\" I reply. \n\"No, I've not had the vaccine.\" \n\"But what about if you HAVE had the vaccine – only the nanobots have just been told to erase your memory of having had the vaccine?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I …\" \n\"Because surely Nicolas and Steven would target the dissenters first? I mean they'd leave the rest of us sheep till the end and just deal with the troublemakers first.\" \n\"I don't …\" \n\"Though nanobots probably couldn't completely erase your memory because they'd never be able to traverse every single synapse,\" I interject thoughtfully. \"So you'd still have some vestiges of the memory in there. Not enough to make you remember but maybe enough that you'd feel like you'd had a dream or nightmare about it. And maybe they'd just need to reinforce your programming a bit every now and then. Have you felt the urge to watch National Treasure or Hard to Kill ?\" \n\"I don't think so?\" \n\"Have you watched more than one Nicolas Cage movie?\" \n\"Uh, sure.\" \n\"And you felt compelled to do it?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"You must have been. Nicolas Cage plays the same character in all his movies, so you'd only need to watch one – unless you'd been PROGRAMMED to watch more. And pretty much all Steven Seagal's movies are the same, so …\" \n\"Lots of people have done that.\" \n\"Yeah, that's how pandemics work,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"This is ridiculous.\" \n\"Is it? Did you enjoy Hard to Kill ?\" \n\"I … suppose so.\" \n\"There you go. They got to you years ago,\" the PFY says. \n\"What?!\" \n\"Maybe the REAL conspiracy has nothing to do with COVID and 5G. Maybe it's all about more movies!\" \n\"Steven Sea-quel?\" I add. \"The clue's in the name.\" \n\"What?!\" \n\" National Treasure 3 . Ridiculously Hard to Kill . See what I'm saying?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"That'll be the nanobots,\" the PFY says as we get up to leave. \n\"I'd get the injection,\" I add. \nSometimes you've got to feed the crazy. ® \n"}
{"Date":1639094400000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2021\/12\/10\/","Title":"BOFH: Time to put the Pretty Dumb F in PDF reader","Link":"\/2021\/12\/10\/bofh_2021_episode_22\/","Content":"Episode 22 Nggggggggaaargh! \nThe Boss has decided that because ONE user \"had really good results\" with a particular PDF viewer we should roll it out company-wide – \"because there's bound to be someone else who'll want to use it.\" \nAnd the software is rubbish. It's a turd in a water tank and everyone can taste it, but the Boss likes it because (a) it's free, and (b) it allows the user to \"edit\" PDFs plagiarised from the web. And by \"edit\" I mean crudely – the way you can \"edit\" your house with an axe. \nMy technical opinion of the software is sought. \n\"It's rubbish,\" I opine technically. \"It crashes all the time and drops temp files all over the place.\" \n\"Yes, but I think we still want to trial it anyway,\" The Boss responds, no doubt considering the positives noted above. \"For everyone ,\" he adds. \nBecause trials always work best when you just roll them out to everyone. \nAnd that is why I got into the IT game – so a halfwit who talked the company into paying for his Executive MBA can then experiment on that same company to support his viewpoint that free software is better than \"the expensive stuff\" . \nNow don't get me wrong – I like free software as much as the next person who's never pirated anything in his life. But there's free software and there's free software. You commonly either get (a) the bomb-proof stuff that's made by a crack team of like-minded people with a laser focus and clear development road map, or (b) the stuff slapped together by a disintegrating group of people with ADHD which is buggier than a bullfrog's breakfast. \nAnd this particular software has the heady aroma of semi-digested Diptera all over it. \nSo now we've got to roll out rubbish software which will no doubt drop crap all over the place like a tourist after a bad curry. \nThe beauty of this approach for the Boss is there are no support issues… for him. He'll just bang away, completing his EMBA Individual Project about the benefits of free software whilst cherry-picking the results he wants from the septic morass of our user outcomes. \nThe PFY and I, on the other hand, will be cleaning up this mess for months. \n\"Sure,\" I respond. \"Maybe just send me an email to that effect.\" \n\"No problem,\" he replies. \nMoments later an email arrives as promised, telling us to install AN alternative PDF reader. \n\"Just need to clarify,\" I say, popping back to his office. \"That software you wanted installed?\" \n\"The one we were talking about,\" he says. \n\"Yes, but in your email you just said AN alternative PDF reader – not which one.\" \n\"Did I? Well, you know which one it is, so just go ahead with that.\" \nIt would seem that one of his first lessons in the EMBA program was one on avoiding blame. \nAgain, don't get me wrong – I'm all for formal qualifications. And if you can't trust a degree whose academic prerequisite involves paying a lot of cash, what can you trust? \nI fire a quick email back to the Boss asking him to identify the software. \nNothing. \nA day later he's back because nothing's been installed. \n\"I can't remember which one you said,\" I lie, knowing full well that only one of us has an academic deadline to meet. \nThe Boss scratches down the name of the software in question and I make a point of picking up the paper with some tweezers from my drawer and popping it in a ziplock bag labelled \"Exhibit A\" . \nAnother day later he's back – a little bit agitated – as his Project report is one day closer to being late. \n\"Oh, you know what?\" I say. \"I saw that bit of paper, but I just couldn't remember what I was supposed to do with it.\" \n\"FINE!\" he says calmly, storming off to his office. \nMoments later he emails the mandate to us. It reads a little like a manifesto, outlining the importance of free software to the huddled business masses, along with words of encouragement to the PFY and myself to take the initiative to embrace free software solutions as the future of IT. \nWe could be heroes! \nBut just for one day. \n\"No chance,\" the PFY says, reading the latter part of that message. \"Should I take a cloud snapshot?\" \n\"You bet!\" I say. \nThe next day the software is rolled out, and all the alternatives are silently removed. True, the Boss didn't explicitly ask us to remove everyone's PDF readers – but we want this trial to be representative after all. There's crucial research depending on it. \n\"How is everyone finding it?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Well, only a few of the users dislike it,\" I say. \n\"Excellent,\" the Boss chirps. \n\"Yeah, the rest of them hate it and want your head on a pole,\" I add. \"I think the lack of persistence of user settings is unpopular, as is the way it opens files for write and locks them.\" \n\"I think the straw that breaks the camel's back, though, is the convert-to-PDF function,\" the PFY chimes in, \"which should actually be called convert-to-PDF-which-can-only-be-read-by-this-reader function.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Oh yes. Were you aware the conversion process was one-way? Like, if you drop a Word document on it and choose convert-to-PDF the only way someone else can read or edit it is with this software?\" \n\"I … uh …\" \n\"You didn't by any chance happen to edit your Project and do a convert-to-PDF on it to mail it, did you?\" the PFY asks knowingly. \n\"I …\" \n\"Don't worry. We took a backup. Would you like us to use free software to do the recovery?\" \n\"I … no.\" \n\"So you want the other stuff?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"The stuff that costs money?\" \n\"Uh … yes.\" \n\"Well, you'd better give us some of that, then. Actually, just chuck your wallet over …\" \n"}
{"Date":1640304000000,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/Archive\/2021\/12\/24\/","Title":"BOFH: The vengeance bus is coming, and everybody's jumping. An Xmas bonus hits me…","Link":"\/2021\/12\/24\/bofh_2021_episode_23\/","Content":"Episode 23 It wouldn't be Christmas without the smell of chestnuts on an open fire and the sound of carols in the air … \nClick to enlarge \nAnd, as I wake up from my brandy-induced chair-nap in Mission Control, the thought occurs to me that the roasting smell is more dumpster-fire than open-fire, with hints of component rather than chestnut. And come to think of it, those carols do sound a little … siren-y. \nAs my brain clears out some of the alcohol fumes, I notice a few things. \nMission Control is a lot harder to see through than normal. \nIt's a lot warmer than it usually is. \nOh … and my wrists and ankles appear to be cable-tied to my chair … \nI'm sure it's probably some simple misunderstanding. However, my memory is somewhat impaired by the morning's beverages. That said, as the brandy mist parts, I seem to recall … \n… One week ago … \nChristmas bonuses – in our company at least – are a thing of the past. Whereas at one time the bonus was a Christmas Club for the masses, this tradition has been eroded to little more than a can of low alcohol lager, a three-quid box of sugar, nut & dairy free chocolates, and a stirring address from the Chairman about belt-tightening. \nThe rub is that the last time he tightened his belt was probably 40kg and two wives ago. But he still has the same belt, which gives him the look of a partially made balloon animal. \nThose at higher levels in the organisation, however, still get a \"seasonal performance bonus\" from their immediate superiors – essentially reflecting the number of co-workers they've managed to push under the bus when accountability comes calling. \nI have something similar going with the PFY, only it has to be a real bus. As a system of reducing Yuletide complaints calls, it's second to none and well worth the bus hire fees. \nTHIS year however, there's a rumour circulating that senior management have approved a secret one-off bonus for the best team player in each department. APPARENTLY the winner will be announced on the final day and get … wait for it … a 5K holiday bonus. \nThe PFY and I immediately formulate a foolproof plan to lay our hands on that bonus – that is, until we find out that it's not being paid in cash. \nI reluctantly return the bus keys to the hook behind the door. \n\"There's nothing for it,\" I say to the PFY. \"We'll need to team up to win this!\" \n\"How?\" he asks. \n\"One of us has to become the fall guy – the Mission Control scapegoat if you will. The other will be the saint – the person who struggles to deliver better service to everyone but has been thwarted at every turn by the evil one.\" \nA deal is struck between the PFY and myself to share the bonus equally and a coin is tossed. \nWithin the hour the PFY is oozing around the department installing the upgrades we'd previously refused to do whilst implying that it was I who had deleted their requests. \nI step into my role as well: dropping the wireless out, claiming that social media is costing the company a fortune. By the end of the day I'm less popular than a Yoko Ono double album. \nThe worse I get, the better the PFY gets, and within a few days he's a genuine hero. Not only did he restore the wireless, he's also given freely of himself for the benefit of others – having given away his monitors, wheely chair and graphics card. \nFor my part, I vocally proclaim that no one's getting any of my stuff and that the wireless issue will be escalated to senior management. \"So, I think we're doing well,\" the PFY comments, back at Mission Control. \n\"I'm sponsoring pre-Christmas drinks and nibbles at morning tea time tomorrow, which should elevate me to sainthood.\" \n\"True enough,\" I say. \"And I let it be known that I had been the culprit who locked out all the lifts except the freight elevator – because of the dangers of Omicron. And whilst no one can find the dead fish behind the lift panel there's a strong suspicion that it was my doing.\" \n\"Yes,\" the PFY says. \"We really have done a great job. They love me and hate you. It's an almost perfect plan – with only one flaw.\" \n\"A flaw?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, the lack of a renegotiation clause.\" \n\"A what now?\" \n\"Well we DID agree 50\/50, but I'm thinking more like 80\/20 – to reflect my higher standing.\" \n\"WHAT?!\" \n\"Let's face it,\" the PFY says smugly. \"You've got no chance at winning and I'm pretty much guaranteed to win – so why not settle for some money, as opposed to no money …\" \nI take a moment to weigh up my options. \n\"I … So, what if suddenly you weren't so popular?\" I counter. \"What if someone found the video of you slipping the fish behind the panel in the freight elevator?\" \n\"Oh didn't I tell you?\" the PFY says. \"I did a bit of a spring-clean. Erased all the old footage. I might have even forgotten to turn the cameras back on …\" \n\"I see,\" I say, reaching for the hammer in my top drawer. \n\"Tell you what,\" the PFY says, \"as a gesture of goodwill, I offer this.\" \nHe places an envelope with a bunch of Turings on the table. \n\"Cash money,\" the PFY whispers. \nI pause once more, then reach for the envelope. After holding each note up to our UV lamp, I reluctantly put the £1,000 in my jacket pocket. \n… \nI'm not exactly sure when I admitted to the PFY that there was no bonus and that I'd started the rumour myself, but it would have probably been at least seven brandies into his morning tea shout … \n… Which brings us to the present … \nThere's some smoke and a bit of heat behind me and I'm fairly sure there'll be an isopropyl-enhanced rubbish bin on fire. I notice that someone's covered up the smoke and heat sensors in the roof and taped around the door frame to the server room to prevent smoke egress. \n\"So here we are,\" the PFY says from the shadows. \"Just you, me, and an office that's about catch fire.\" \nThe PFY wheels himself around to me on the chair he swapped with one of the users during his publicity campaign. It's a crappy chair, and one of the wheels isn't castoring properly. \n\"I'll be needing that cash back,\" he murmurs, moving the burning bin closer. \"In the desk,\" I gasp. \"Top drawer, inside the laptop bag.\" \nThe PFY takes the envelope from the laptop bag, then heads to the door, pausing only to mutter a sarcastic \"Merry Christmas\" before engaging the mechanical door lock as well as the electronic lock and exiting the room. \nAs the heat moves closer, I can't help but reflect upon what I'd have done in the PFY's position. \nHe'll learn. \n"}

Well, the electrics in 'classic' cars are notoriously unreliable.\" \n\"And you don't think it's suspicious that it caught fire seconds after I left the building?\" he asks. \n\"Seconds after entering oxygen-rich air and accelerating to a speed which would both drive your aging alternator faster and fan any emergent flames?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I guess when you put it like that...\" the Boss admits grudgingly. \"But I've lost everything.\" \n\"Oh, were your wife and kids in the Austin?\" \n\"No, but...\" \n\"So just your house, life's savings, that timeshare in France and your superannuation scheme?\" \n\"No all my work things!

So why are you here and not with your vehicle?\" \n\"The car's being towed by a recovery firm. I have a friend who can restore it to a usable state.\" \n\"Oh, you know someone with a compactor?\" the PFY says. \n\"He did the original restoration,\" the Boss says, ignoring the PFY. \n\"He's an Austin Cambridge specialist and I'm sure he'll get it back into working condition.\" \nI make a mental note to get another sunlight switch and a length of primer cord long enough to wrap around a fuel line. \n\"So what brings you here?\" \n\"I need a new access card. For the building. I thought I may as well get one now.\" \n\"Good point,\" the PFY says. \"OK, so let's just see...\" \n>tappity< >tap< >clicky< >click< >tap< ...there you are. And >click< REISSUE. \nRight, so I'll just need to see two forms of ID. \n\"Why?\" \n\"It's asking for two forms of ID. We didn't used to need that, but then a couple of the more entitled board members started getting worried about people floating over here on driftwood with the express purpose of putting their medical degree to good work as one of our cleaners...\" \n\"What are you on about?\" \n\"The board. Pretty much every second board meeting they've brainstormed another question designed to keep the company safe from the threat of the day – migrants, money laundering, terrorism – you name it, there's a question in the on-boarding process to deal with it.\" \n\"But I'm already on-boarded.\" \n\"Indeed you are – but what better way to filter out the bad eggs than when they want their security access card renewed.\" \n\"But I don't have any ID. It was burnt.\" \n\"We really only have your word for that,\" the PFY says. \n\"IT'LL BE ON THE CAMERAS!\" the Boss says triumphantly. \nAnd so it is. The moment the smoke starts entering the car the Boss' driving takes on a blind-man-in-a-trolley-dash vibe with him careering off into a number of vehicles before rolling from the vehicle like a sedated stuntman. \n\"It doesn't show your ID being burned.\" \n\"IT'S IN THE CAR!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"So you say.\" \n\"Look, how about we waive the ID...\" I say. \n\"YES!\" the Boss chips in. \n\"...If he can find two people to confirm he is who he says he is.\" \n\"You two can do it.\" \n\"I dunno. I think we need impartial people. There's no oversight if we're confirming your identity AND verifying the credentials of ourselves. It'd be a conflict of interest.\" \nThe Boss stalks off and eventually rounds up a couple of the staff. \n\"Excellent!\" the PFY says. \"Now I need to confirm your bank account name and number.\" \n\"Why do you need my bank account number?\" the Boss asks. \n\"That money laundering thing,\" the PFY says. \n\"I don't know my bank account number.\" \n\"Do you know any verifiable banking information?\" the PFY sighs. \n\"I know my credit card number.\" \n\"Let's have it then,\" the PFY says, clicking on a box. \nThe Boss provides the information, which will no doubt be used in the future by his insurance company to verify who'd purchased the primer cord and timer. \n\"COVID pass?\" the PFY continues. \n\"It got burnt.\" \n\"Do you have an online copy?\" \n\"The laptop got burnt.\" \n\"Another electronic copy?\" \n\"My phone got burnt.\" \n\"Can you talk HR into waiving that or looking up your details?\" \n...quarter of an hour later... \n\"Ok, and can you confirm your date of birth?\" ... \n\"Mother's maiden name?\" ... \n\"Favourite primary school teacher?\" \n\"Look, why do you need all this information?\" the Boss snaps. \"I've been here for over an hour and I need to get home!\" \n\"We have to establish some verification questions for next time – so we don't have to go through this process again.\" \n\"Oh, Jones.

I just thought I'd catch a few words with you and hopefully clear up a misunderstanding.\" \nThe viscosity of Gary's bravado takes a bit of a nose dive as the lift eases to a halt between floors. I nod at the camera on the roof so that Gary can witness the LED turning off. \n\"What misunderstanding?\" Gary asks. \n\"Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. Last week, my assistant Stephen was in the cafeteria and he thought he overheard a snippet of conversation between you and your boss where you referred to us both as, uh, 'Dusty old relics' – I think that was the term he used. I assured him that he must have been mistaken.\" \n\"I … uh …\" \n\"Yes, he must have misheard. I mean his hearing's not what it once was – but that's from years of working in close proximity to drum printers in a time where hearing protection was reserved for artillery – and even then it was optional.\" \n\"Uh …\" Gary repeats, unsure of where I'm going with this. \n\"And I'm several years older than him, so my hearing's probably worse.   When I started working in IT, I had a three-month job of reading in old punch cards in a very small room with no ventilation. The same room they stored the isopropyl alcohol in – in rusty tin containers.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"It was a very warm room and I had to work inside with the door closed – because of the noise.\" \n\"I think …\" \n\"But I know that for you words like 'drum printers' and 'punch card readers' may as well be 'horseless carriages' and 'cement ponds', but they were state-of-the art IT at one time,\" I say. \n\"I'm sure …\" \n\"And so I can see how easy it might be to look down upon us folk without a YouTube channel pushing the virtues of the latest gaming keyboard – yes, I have visited your channel, Gary – but you know what they say: 'Watch out for the old guys because they know where the bodies were buried'.\" \n\"Aaaaah …\" Gary mouths uncertainly. \n\"But to tell you the truth, Gary, I have no idea where the bodies are buried.\" \nGary relaxes slightly, no doubt recharging his bravado glands. \n\"No idea at all,\" I say, shaking my head, taking a small step forward and lowering my voice. \"I mean … it's so dark out there, and one forestry road looks much like another. I mean I'll honestly try to help the cold case people when they come knocking, but my memory isn't what it once was and I get confused.  Because of the isopropyl. And the noise. The endless noise. Do you know sometimes I wake up at night and I can still hear the drum printers screaming? At least I think it's the drum printers.\" \n\"Uh …\" Gary mumbles, no doubt wondering what response works best with insane people. \n\"Though if they ever get a sniffer dog with a nose for carpet …\" I pause. \"Anyway, I thought I'd just have a quiet word as when it comes to workplace disagreements I like to meet people halfway. Typically, halfway between their tube station and their home. At night. With a van.\" \n\"I don't think I know what you're …\" Gary starts. \n\"Anyway I'm sure it's a misunderstanding. Like at your place.\" \n\"My place?\" \n\"Yeah, your basement flat in Balham. The one barely 50 metres from that storage shed where all those bags of potassium nitrate are hidden.\" \n\"That's not my shed!\" \n\"Sure it is! There's a key to it hidden behind one of the pictures in your kitchen. You bought the fertiliser on your credit card on Tuesday. You even signed for the delivery yesterday. Your fingerprints are on the delivery receipt – AND the tape holding that key to the back of your picture.\" \n\"N—\" \n\"Trust me, they ARE on the receipt,\" I say. \"And the tape. And a word to the wise: Suppliers are obliged to alert the authorities to large purchases of fertiliser.\" \n\"…\" \nAnyway, I am a dusty old relic. When I was young the future was shown to us in fanciful 'documentaries' like Beyond 2000 . \n\"We were all going to have three-course meals in pill form and be driving flying cars. Some of us would be living on the Moon in bubble houses powered by cosmic rays, with robot dogs to fetch the electronic newspapers – which would be delivered from Earth in daily mail spaceships.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"Have you heard of chaos theory, Gary?\" I ask, rhetorically. \"One of the learnings from chaos theory is that the further out you go, the more chaos there is, which makes the future so hard to predict.\" \n\"I don't see ho—\" \n\"So whilst I can't tell you what the world will be like in 50 years, I can tell you what your world will be like tomorrow: Pretty bleak. Anyway, perhaps you want to pop home and try and sort this out.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"Unless …\" \n\"Unless?\" Gary asks, desperately. \n\"You're a small fish, Gary, one we'd normally throw back – and we're after the marlin that's interested in auditing historical expense claims.\" \n\"?\" \n\"So how about you pop up to your Boss's office and hand him these sheets of paper and say you think he dropped them. Let him rifle through them for a bit – especially the courier delivery form in the middle. Then happen to notice the key taped to the back of his desk phone and say it's yours and the cleaners must have taped it to his phone instead of yours.\" \n\"Wear gloves,\" the PFY says through the lift speaker. \"Because of your 'psoriasis'.\" \n\"Chop, chop!\" I say, as the lift resumes its journey up to Beancounter Central. \"You've got a personal tragedy to avert.\" ® \n"}

The other, an amazingly patient woman wielding a barcode scanner, has been caught in the crossfire between two young geeks determined to prove their technical acumen in a battle of egos the complexities of which only they and Richard Attenborough could work out. \nRight in the very centre of my vision I'm starting to see those little blurry spots that occasionally occur when you stare into the darkness of a lift shaft for a while … \n\"Yes but an i9 is typically overkill for standard users,\" Geek1 says, looking to the service person for her affirmation. \n\"But why WOULDN'T you go i9 – if cost weren't the deciding factor?\" Geek2 says, also looking to the service person's arbitration skills for a bit of personal validation. \"More cores, more threads, better clock?\" \n\"But cost IS a factor,\" Geek1 counters, directing his next words to the salesperson, \"isn't it?\" \n\"Obviously cost will always be a factor,\" she responds, somewhat reluctant to be dragged into the glue trap of this particular conversation. \n\"But WORK will be paying for the upgrade!\" Geek2 shoots back. \"So wouldn't you say that answers the whole cost-is-an-issue question?\" \nThe service tech takes a barely perceptible step back from the counter, as if remembering an important appointment that she has to get to – then has a last-minute reprieve. \n\"I don't know the answer to that – but Colin probably would,\" she says, as a pre-sales person lumbers into the service area on one of those random missions they go on to avoid customers. \n\"Colin would what?\" Colin asks. \n\"They were comparing the merits of i7 and i9 processors,\" she says drily. \n\"Colin wouldn't give a shit,\" he says, heading for the peace and quiet of the stockroom. \nI realise that to stand a chance of getting out of here before my brand new RAM is discontinued, I'm going to need to act. \n\"What about the i11?\" I ask. \n\"There's no i11!\" Geek1 sneers, whilst rolling his eyes at both Geek2 and the service person, whose name tag reads Catherine. \n\"Oh … so … you've not been …\" I say, raising my eyebrows at the service person knowingly. \n\"Not been what?!\" Geek2 asks. \n\"Uh. Nothing …\" I say. \"Right?\" I ask the service geek. \n\"That's right. There's definitely no i11,\" Catherine says, catching my drift immediately. \"I don't know why everyone keeps talking about it.\" \n\"Wait a minute. Who's been talking about the i11?\" \n\"No one,\" I say. \"I … don't know what I was talking about. I'm old. I get confused.\" \n\"But you seemed to be fairly sure of it,\" Geek1 says. \n\"It was a mistake,\" she says. \"There's no i11. Look, here comes Colin, ask him.\" \n\"Ask Colin what?\" Colin asks. \n\"About the i11,\" I say. \"There isn't one – IS THERE?\" \nIt's a punt, but Colin catches the pass adroitly, both of them clearly having the same view of this pair as I do – apart from the bit where I make a few adjustments to the elevator down to the lower level of the department store. Then again … \n\"Who told you about the i11?\" Colin asks. \"We don't have five of them out back and I don't know why people keep saying that. They're not even a thing.\" \n\"Are they a thing?\" Geek1 asks. \n\"I … no, no. There's no such product. And even if we had any you wouldn't be able to take a look at them by getting Geoff to let you out back with the Intel Code Phrase,\" says Catherine. \nThey're good. They're very good. \n\"What Intel Code Phrase?\" Geek2 asks. \n\"There's no Intel Code Phrase,\" Colin chips in. \n\"No, you just said there was one.\" \n\"No 'There's no Intel Code Phrase' is the Intel Code Phrase. You can ring Intel and check,\" says Catherine. \nTorn between pestering service desk some more or seeing the new i11, the geeks choose the i11. \n\"Works every time,\" Catherine says, as the next person in line takes the geeks' place. \"Geoff will let them into the 'secret room' which happens to be the alleyway beside the building. Now, what can I help you with?\" \nI tell them about the specific RAM request and how their sales droid slipped a substitute in when I wasn't looking. Colin shakes his head and returns with some more RAM and waves away my card when I reach to pay the difference. \nNo doubt he knows I'm keen to get to the carpark to look for a poorly secured van … \nAs I walk to my car, I take one final check of my RAM and notice the seal is broken. Inside I find the same RAM as I've just returned. \nThey're very, VERY good. \nI head back to the service elevator, screwdriver in hand … \n"}

Job cuts are being talked about and the Board are considering an offer from a consultancy which claims to help with post-COVID balance sheet issues. \n\"… and we feel confident, after looking at your expenditure profiles, that we can make some strategic changes that would save your company a significant amount in outgoings,\" the bloke on the other end of the call says. \n\"What sort of savings are we talking about, Gerard?\" a Board member asks. \n\"We'd expect it to be in the order of 20–25 per cent,\" Gerard replies. \nCue murmurs of mild excitement, as this sort of saving would likely trigger a performance bonus for everyone around the table. \nEveryone except the PFY and myself of course. \n\"Interesting proposal,\" our Chairman responds whilst trying not to wet himself. \"And your fee?\" \n\"Our fee would be ten per cent of the costs we helped reduce,\" Gerard replies. \nMore murmurs, but I think the crowd considers that 2 to 2.5 per cent isn't too bitter a pill to swallow. \n\"Okay, we accept,\" the Chairman says. \"So where would you like to start?\" \n\"Once you've signed the contract I'd probably start with the people responsible for the quality of this call,\" Gerard jokes. \nAt least I think he was joking – though that thought isn't reflected in the faces of the Board as all eyes turn to survey the PFY and myself. \n\"I think he was hanging up the call himself,\" the PFY says a couple of minutes later as we descend in the lift. \n\"Might be.\" \n\"He probably engineered the whole thing. Have you looked up the company?\" \n\"Yep,\" I say, flashing him my phone screen. \"Shell company for around ten years, ambiguous name which could mean financial consulting but could just as easily be a dung farming co-op in Yemen. The website's about three weeks old including a photo of Gerard – and only Gerard – in the 'Meet our team' section, although all the blurb refers to 'we' or 'us'.\" \n\"One-man band?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Could be, but we'll find out soon enough when his 'team' does their interviews with us.\" \nBarely 15 minutes later, the PFY and I get invitations to one-on-one Zoom meetings with Gerard's company. By the end of lunchtime, we find out that at least 50 other staff in the company have similar appointments and there's a distinct smell of blood in the water … \n… a day later … \nThe PFY's interview can't have gone well because the nanosecond he gets off the call he's hunting Gerard down on social media. \n\"He asked me what educational qualifications I had that supported me having the role!\" the PFY snaps. \"Then he wanted to know how I justified my salary when the technical side of the work we do is fairly pedestrian!\" \nAnd it's not just him. When the Boss came back from his interview he was almost weeping.  Apparently, he forgot one of the questions and tried to blather his way through it and somehow wound up talking about erectile dysfunction before launching into a mental list of the rest of the staff's shortcomings. With the appalling soundproofing in his office, he's now about as toxic as Pol Pot's portaloo. \nOne of the Beancounters resigned after a question about a spreadsheet function that he couldn't answer. Apparently, he saw the writing on the wall and leapt from the top of it. \n\"They're saying he wants to close down the company cafeteria,\" the PFY murmurs after returning from lunch. \n\"Yes, but THEY say a lot of things,\" I say, having just finished my interview. \"When you get down to it, Gerard's a fairly dull person to speak to – and I've talked to OS\/2 fans. I'd go as far as saying he doesn't have an original bone in his body and that you'd find all of his business acumen and strategic direction setting in a handful of budget management books.\" \n\"I don't think you can write him off so easily,\" the PFY says, shaking his head. \n\"No seriously, he really IS based on five or six business financial books,\" I reply. \"Those books there, in fact.\" I gesture at a pile of books behind my desk. \"The easy part was the visuals and the AI – I just paid an AR company for that. The hard part was distilling the bullet points in the books into a decision tree.\" \n\"Gerard's not real?\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Of course he is,\" I shoot back. \"He's a real AI. Obviously, people would eventually twig that they're talking to a Sim, but with a teleconferencing link you can hide some of the worst glitches. On top of that, people are in defensive mode because they're being interviewed. And if Gerard ever gets cornered he can just break into one of his 'perceptive' stress questions.\" \n\"What's a perceptive stress question?\" \n\"Oh, there's about ten of them, all completely ambiguous, but with an underlying accusation of some form of misconduct. You know the sort of things: asking someone about the anomalies in their workplace timekeeping and attendance; hinting that their work-from-home performance was seriously under par; suggesting that a previous interviewee has in a roundabout way implied they're a stalker; maybe just mentioning that office supplies belong to the company and that taking them home is stealing. Then there's just also asking them a question about something obscure that they think they should know – like the parameter list for the FACTDOUBLE excel function.\" \n\"So what – this is all for your amusement?\" \n\"Hell no. This is for the money. Gerard has a binding contract with the Board of Directors to receive 2.5 per cent of the money he saves the company – whether they implement the changes or not.\" \n\"And what's Gerard going to recommend?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Gerard's going to recommend firing the Board.\" \nSomeone's getting a performance bonus! \n"}

Can you give me an idea of the problem?\" \n\"Lots of things,\" Carl says, sounding a bit peeved I'm not trusting his functionality compass. \n\"Sure, sure,\" I say kindly. \"Just help me out with the specifics.\" \n\"Colour depth,\" Carl says. \"The colours aren't right.\" \n\"Mmmm …\" I murmur. \n\"And there's not enough system memory,\" he continues. \n\"Memory. Right, right,\" I affirm. \"Anything else?\" \n\"The hard drive's too small, and the CPU's too slow.\" \n\"OK, I think that about covers it.

They execute dictators more often than that.\" \n\"A lot of them don't make it past the focus groups,\" he replies. \n\"Since you've been here, Carl, none of them have made it past the focus groups. In fact, until you got here, we didn't even have focus groups.\" \n\"The company would rather have quality than quantity,\" he explains. \n\"Yes, but if the quantity is zero, one has to wonder whether you're just feeding and watering a bunch of your mates on the company dime and then axing the product to spend more work time playing MMORPGs at home – instead of coming into work.\" \n\"I was diagnosed with WTS – that's wind turbine syndrome ,\" Carl says, defensively. \n\"Yes. You started 13 months ago, we all spent 11 of those months in isolation and the last two you've been battling, um, WTS.

A stay that I'm fairly sure would be punctuated by a series of incidents where a saline drip becomes inexplicably contaminated with chilli sauce moments after I fall asleep. \nBest not to dwell on it. \nObviously, as IT professionals, we will not decide this simple dispute with some loutish display of primacy – but rather an unspoken Karpov\/Spassky battle of wills. The PFY plays his pawn, I play mine. The PFY sacrifices a bishop, I push one of the helpdesk guys down the stairs because I see a suspicious shadow (which turned out to be nothing). All's fair in love and war. \nMy arrival to work is greeted with some disturbing news. The Boss has slipped in the toilets, clocked his head on a basin and landed heavily, breaking his hip. Part of me feels bad for him, while another part says I should have mentioned the missing can of silicon spray lubricant I noticed yesterday afternoon. \nAnother pawn has fallen – though neither of us can claim a loss or a victory. \nHistory has taught the PFY and myself that Mission Control and its adjoining rooms are not in the field of play. However, hiding there gives your opponent the opportunity to prepare surprises for your eventual exit.  In addition, hiding too long might also give your opponent the opportunity to argue a technicality and send something in to find you – so it's best to keep on the move. \nI'm currently in the Director's office ordering an onion bhaji pizza in the PFY's name in an effort to draw him out. I have no idea where he is, but I do see the tell-tale dust from ceiling tiles in the corridor so I know there's something waiting up there for me – unless of course it's a bluff. \nThe PFY launches a knight to king 4 when I hear my car alarm go off and a quick glance out the window reveals a small-form-factor desktop machine embedded in the laminations of my windscreen. Ordinarily, this would demand an immediate retaliatory attack – but that's just what the PFY would be expecting. \nBesides, I sold the car to one of the accountants last night because it looked like it was riding uncommonly low and I wasn't interested in discovering I'd got several jerry cans of petrol in the boot – rigged to the 17th brake light activation – while pulling 70 on the motorway. \nThe pizza delivery guy arrives and I use the diversion to relocate. I know the PFY's not going to go for the pizza, but I also know that he'll be focussing his attention on that immediate area to see if I'm surveying it as well. \nThe CCTV system is useless. Those cameras that weren't obscured will have been reorientated to point at walls and ceilings – something that will annoy Security when they wake up from their nightly carb coma at the end of their shift. That said, I take a look anyway. Only one camera is still working and it's immediately outside the room to which I was intending to relocate – which means the PFY is either reading my mind, in the room concerned, or he wants me to think he's in the room. \nIt looks like I'm going to have to sacrifice a pawn. I call down to Security, waking one of them from their nap, and tell him I noticed a delivery person wandering the hallway near the camera carrying an onion bhaji pizza whose owner he couldn't find. He will have sensed a stirring in the Force when the pizza entered the building in the first place, so in less time than it takes to put his boots on, do his belt up, walk to the lift, press the button, wait for the lift, go back to his office because he forgot to take a packet of barley sugars for the trip, return to the lift, press the button again, wait for the lift again, ride the lift to the second floor, put the empty barley sugar box in the bin and amble to the corridor in question, he's there. \nThe door opens to an empty room and my thoughts start turning to the topic of détente, as this may be a battle I cannot win. I don't know where the PFY is, he seems to be anticipating my every move and I'm running out of ideas. Time to relocate again to consider my options. \nI step out into the corridor at the same time as the PFY steps out into the corridor barely ten meters from me. The PFY's expression of fear and doubt mirrors my own. \n\"Maybe we should …\" the PFY says hesitantly, as the security guard blunders around the corner behind him \"… call this off?\" \nI see that the tide has turned, and that as adversaries neither the PFY nor I will be able to maintain the upper hand. It was inevitable really – over the years I have imparted to him every lesson from my Machiavelli-tinged Art-of-War playbook. \nWe are equals. \n\"He ate your pizza,\" I say to the tired and hangry guard, pointing at the PFY. \nWell, there's always room to add another play to the playbook … \n"}

But luckily change-control was one of those management fads easily stifled with a relentless campaign of punctiliously observing the change control procedures for even the tiniest change. \nEven the most stalwart advocate of change control would crumble under the weight of 48 separate \"Network Switch Update\" change control notifications when permitting an additional VLAN for every user port on a switch. \nMultiply that by 28 switches and you've got an inbox full of rubbish obscuring the needle-in-the-haystack firmware update message. \nBut those days are long gone. Now we only have to change control the important changes – and \"important\" is a very subjective term. I mean, upgrading the firmware on the espresso machine? IMPORTANT. Flashing the BIOS on my gaming laptop? IMPORTANT. Core Switch firmware? Not even on our radar. \nAnd speaking of not on our radar, I get a text message that the management VLAN and console port of the core switch are no longer with us … \nObviously there's no need to panic – the pre-boot self-checking of this particular vendor is renowned for being glacially slow and nitpickingly verbose. I don't expect that to come back up for another ten minutes. \nTen minutes later the PFY reports no activity on the console, even after checking the serial port settings in case the new firmware's changed the port characteristics – which vendors like to slip into firmware updates without telling anyone. \nTen more minutes later the PFY tells me he's in the server room, looking at a non-standard set of status LEDs. He sends me a photo of the LEDs – which don't represent any of the fault codes I've seen. \nAfter another couple of minutes he sends me an email with a WARNING.TXT file in included in the firmware zip, pointing out that leap-frogging of major updates is no longer supported. \nIn situations like this there's always a choice. \nCHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE! \nA: Go into the ROM monitor, do some low-level deleting, then perform an excruciatingly slow serial upload of the old firmware (which will fail four times out of five, with buffering issues). \nOR … \nB: Remove any evidence of your work and come in at 8am to \"find the switch has failed!\" \n\"It'll be a hardware fault,\" I tell the Boss, choosing option B like a true professional. \"Happens all the time.\" \n\"The switch is almost three years old, after all.\" \nI don't tell him that some of our switches are so old they have dust from the Big Bang in them, choosing instead to imply that three years is pretty old for a switch. \n\"Do we have a spare?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Oh no! I mean, that switch was pretty expensive,\" I respond. \n\"How expensive?\" \nCHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE! \nA: Tell him the truth: that the switch concerned only cost a couple of grand and we can probably fix it with a firmware flash in a couple of hours. \nOR … \nB: There's this app-connected espresso machine with multiple bean hoppers which can grind a blend specific to your personal tastes … \n\"I think it was about seven grand,\" I lie, \"Option-B\" -ing again. \n\"SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"It's the 10-gig connectivity,\" I add. \"And we'll have to pay a premium to jump the queue to get it delivered today.\" \nOne of the immutable rules of IT budgeting is that a critical failure opens a fatter chequebook than a beautifully presented business case … \n\"Well, I suppose we'll have to do it,\" the Boss sighs, heading off up the food chain to break the bad news while I, meanwhile, get onto my coffee supplier with the good news. \nThree hours and one large \"switch\" delivery later, I'm enjoying my first Brazilian\/Ethiopian blend of the day as the PFY reloads the switch and we get back online again. \n\"Is this new?\" the Boss asks, spotting our new coffee machine the moment he walks through the door. \n\"This?\" I reply. \"No, had it for ages. We just never got around to plumbing it in …\" \nThe words are barely out of my mouth when the Boss's brow wrinkles at the information on his phone in response to his scan of the QR code on the side of the machine. \n\"This says it was commissioned today.\" \n\" Commissioned , yes, but we've had it for ages.\" \n\"It says it's the 2022 model.\" \nCHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE! \nA: Admit you have misappropriated a vast stack of cash for a coffee machine. \nOR … \nB: Admit nothing and cover your tracks. \n\"2022 model?

Slowly but surely, though, the load has crept up to the point that both UPS units were showing a projected load of 120 percent apiece – as opposed to the design load of 45 percent individually. \nAs the load grew, it became necessary to remove it from the monitoring system. I was getting an order of magnitude more email from it than everywhere else. \n\"How long will it take to get everything back up again?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Hmmm …\" I say, staring into the flames in the distance. \"I'm thinking maybe an hour to put the fire out, five to 24 hours to find and deliver a new transformer, another two to six hours to pull the old transformer out, put the new one in, and connect it up. I'd round it up to two days.\" \n\"TWO DAYS!\" the Boss gasps. \"We can't be down for two days!\" \n\"We're not down for two days,\" I say. \"Most of our stuff's in the cloud. It's just the building operations that are down.\" \n\"Ah, well, that's not so bad then.\" \n\"Though when the security system batteries die it might get a bit challenging – depending on whether they fail open or locked.\" \n\"Why isn't the generator running?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The generator is auto-started by the UPS – but the UPS switched in for about a nanosecond then went into bypass because of the high load.\" \n\"What high load?\" \n\"Good question. We no longer know what's hooked up to our UPS.\" \n\"Can you find out?\" \n\"We could do a partial power up then a power survey,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"How do we do that?\" \n\"Flip off all the UPS breakers, restart the UPS – which will kick the generator on as well – then power up breakers one at a time and see what the load on each of them is.\" \n\"Is it good to turn equipment on and off like that?\" \n\"'Good' is a fairly subjective term. 'Quick' is probably what you're looking for in this instance.\" \n… Five minutes later … \n>Clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< >clack< \n\"Right, so everything is off; Now RESET THE UPS …\" >click< >beep< >click< \"… which will start the generator …\" >hmmmmm< \"… and turn on the first breaker.\" \n>click< \n\"Okay 3 percent. This breaker off and the next breaker on …\" >clack<  >click< \"… 4 percent. Next breaker …\" >clack< >click< \"… 2 percent …\" \n… \n\"… And final breaker …\" >clack< >click< \"… 38 percent.\" \nAnd so we have the main culprit. About 40 percent of both UPS units is being consumed by a couple of chunky circuits which appear to terminate in the beancounters' office. We flip both circuits back on and go upstairs to see what's running. \n… \nPretty much everything. \nAnd by everything I mean four under-desk heaters, two small fridges, the entire kitchenette – including a big fridge, microwave, dishwasher, and an under-sink hot and chilled water unit. Oh, and about 15 workstations of various sorts. \n… \n\"Forty percent!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Yeah, though UPS units are pretty bad at reading actual loads,\" the PFY lies, \"you know, because of hysteresis loops, power factor anomalies, and the Batenburg LeydenJar conjecture.\" \n***DUMMY MODE ON*** \n\"Of course,\" the Boss says. \"So can we get a more accurate figure of power use to pass on to the finance people?\" \n\"We just need a broader sample base. So we just power down the circuit and then power it up again to see if we get a different reading. Over time with several samples we'd get a far more accurate figure.\" \n\"How many samples do you think you'll need?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Oh, not more than a couple of hundred – maybe two minutes apart.\" \nThe Boss does some quick mental arithmetic and realizes that we're talking about seven hours of his time standing around watching us flick switches. \n\"Can you not speed it up a little?\" he suggests. \n\"I guess so,\" the PFY responds. \n… Thirty-six 'samples' and about one minute later … \n\"See!\" the PFY says. \"The load is now only 28 percent!\" \n\"And that's accurate then?\" the Boss asks. \n\"We won't know for another … 164 samples …\" \n… One hundred and sixty-four 'samples' later … \n\"So one percent,\" the Boss says. \n\"It would appear so,\" the PFY says. \"So maybe we should load verify the CEO's office as well …\" \n… 40 very high-speed 'samples' later … \n\"Zero percent!\" the PFY gasps. \"You know, I think we can turn everything back on again.\" \n>click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< >click< \n>JANGLE!< \n\"What's that?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"That's the fire alarm coming back online,\" I reply. \"If you're lucky it'll be the smoke from the transformer that was drawn into our fresh air fans as they powered down – but if you're not lucky it'll be all that kit we smoked out by turning it on and off 200 times.\" \nI think it's safe to say that the Boss isn't looking all that lucky … \n"}

My grandad told me that they did the blindfold game at one of his old jobs.\" \n\"Oh yes?\" Jamie says. \"And who was he working for, one of the tech giants?\" \n\"No, no,\" the PFY counters. \"He worked for Joseph Stalin. But great for morale. It might have just been the extra office space though...\" \nI could be wrong, but I think I just sensed an improvement in morale. \n\"So, what we're going to do,\" Jamie continues, \"is the people with the blindfold each reach into this bag and pull out a letter. Their team guides them to insert that letter back into its corresponding hole in the table. The team who's replaced the most letters when we run out of letters is the winner! So, are we ready?\" \nThere are some general grunts of resignation as people form into teams and start; Jamie handing the reins to the Boss while he pops downstairs to his car to get the scoreboard. I note that during the distraction the PFY has taken one of the letters from the Bag and popped it into the bin... \nThe game starts and there's a surprising amount of excitement as the letters are spun and twisted and crammed into the holes in response to the shouts of the various teams. The game ends and the Boss checks his pad before looking up. \n\"There's something missing from the A hole,\" he hints. \n\"Yeah, he's getting the scoreboard now,\" the PFY chips in. \nThis morale thing seems to be going great guns. \nJamie's late morning session is a gruelling self-awareness session where we're supposed to realise how much time we waste on computers instead of spending quality time with people. \nHe shows us a heartrending video about the long-term harmful effects of \"IT isolation,\" how it affects our clients, our workmates and, ultimately, ourselves then opens the floor to a discussion on how we can be more present. \n\"I mean we're not bad really,\" the PFY says. \"We had a Boss who was way worse than us.  He once spent about a month plugged into his machine with no interest in any of the projects we were working on.\" \n\"And by the way you say that, I sense you had to intervene?\" \n\"Several times – just to try and snap him out of it.\" \n\"And did that work?\" \n\"I really don't know,\" the PFY says. \"After a while they wouldn't let me back into the cardiac ward.\" \nIt seems like office morale is inversely proportional to Jamie's enthusiasm. \nWe break for lunch and I see Jamie preparing some mattresses for old party favourite – a trust fall exercise. \nI sidle over to him and suggest if we really want to foster trust in the group we should be doing this without mattresses – and in the stairwell – but this isn't Jamie's first dog and pony race, and he politely declines. \nThe PFY is the next to try, suggesting that we could really maximize relief and trust by putting broken glass on the mattress. \"I mean who's not going to trust a co-worker who saves you from broken glass?\" he asks. \n\"The person who saw you put the broken glass there in the first place?\" Jamie responds. \nThe Boss makes some affirmative noises and Jamie obviously feels empowered so I have to take the Boss aside. \n\"I think you're missing the big picture,\" I say to him. \n\"I don't think I am,\" he says. \"This is great for team morale.\" \n\"I didn't mean that big picture. I meant this big picture,\" I say, holding up my phone and pressing the play button. \nA small video starts playing of the Boss on the phone sounding quite harassed. \n\"I don't understand.\" \n\"This is you, on the phone last week?\" I ask. \n\"Yes. There was a note on my desk to call that number.\" \n\"The number of, let's see... uh...  'Argumentative Escorts' – a premium-rate phone service – for a call which lasted... uh... 33 minutes. We spent over 100 on that phone call on the company bill.\" \nThe PFY adds: \"Anyway, maybe – in the interests of morale - we could uh... all just get back to work, no questions asked?\" \nVICTORY – a dish best served however you wish to do so... \n"}

The phone has not rung once (and not because the PFY has rebooted the phone server with a DBAN USB stick in it again), the aircon and security system are behaving, and outside the sun is shini- \n\"What's he doing here?\" I ask the PFY. \n\"Who?\" the PFY asks, getting up off his chair as he senses a hint of urgency in my tone. \"What's who doing... SH*T!\" \n\"Quick, which printer is offline?\" \n\"None of them,\" he says after a quick scan. \n\"F*CK! We're probably too late. How many do we have left?\" \n\"Uh..... just two, one in security and one in HR!\" \nI'm gone before he's finished the exclamation mark. \nBut it's too late, the damage is done. The HR printer has been repaired and the service engineer – whose heavily emblazoned wagon I'd seen out our window – has gone. \n... \n\"WHO called the service guy?\" I ask. \n\"I did,\" the new HR office manager says. \n\"Why?\" \n\"It was broken.\" \n\"Yes, I KNOW it was broken, and it has been powered down for two years AND there's a label stuck on top of the service label saying that you are to call us if there are printer issues.\" \n\"I don't know about that, I just saw the number when I opened the paper jam panel.\" \nI open the panel and sure enough there's a second service sticker in there – a sticker so hard to remove that we had to put our own label over the one on the top of the machine. I also note that the engineer has slapped a new label over the top of the label we put over his previous label. \n\"What did he do?\" \n\"Oh he said he had to replace some stuff.\" \n\"What stuff?\" \n\"I dunno. It's on this job sheet.\" \nPart of my mental processing is a background stroke-warning subprocess that casually monitors that vein in my forehead. The further I get down the job sheet the more mental processing power the monitor is using. I have to stop before I get CPU bound. \n\"These printers,\" I seethe to the new HR guy, \"are the biggest white elephant the company ever bought – and they're up against some stiff opposition. They're unreliable, have hideously expensive consumables and are so old the page count is in Roman numerals. We do NOT use them. They are switched off and will remain off until the end of the maintenance agreement – in about 18 months.\" \n\"Oh.\" \n\"YOU, However, authorised him to service the machine,\" I say, pointing at his signature on the job sheet, \"and he has replaced all four toner cartridges, the fuser unit and the waste toner box! You can buy a BRAND NEW colour laser for the price of one of those toner cartridges alone!\" \n\"Oh.\" \n\"A toner cartridge which didn't need changing in the first place because WE DON'T USE THOSE PRINTERS! HE SWAPPED AN OLD FULL TONER CARTRIDGE FOR A NEW FULL TONER CARTRIDGE! AN OLD FULL TONER CARTRIDGE THAT HE WILL SELL BACK TO US AGAIN THE NEXT TIME SOMEONE TURNS THIS MACHINE ON!\" \n\"Ah. Well, I guess we just switch it off then?\" he asks. \n\"Yes,\" I reply, trying to lever the new service label off the label we put on the printer. \nHe put them in the paper trays too, he points out \nSure enough, at the bottom of every paper tray is a shiny new service sticker that the sneaky bastar... \n\"What did he say he was doing in the paper trays?\" \n\"Oh he, uh, upgraded the paper for us.\" \nI look at the bottom of the job sheet and my stroke warning process kicks up to 100 percent. \n\"HE CHANGED THE BLOODY PAPER TO US LEGAL AND SOLD YOU 20 BOXES OF THE STUFF!\" \n\"He said it was a steal.\" \n\"THERE WAS DEFINITELY STEALING GOING ON!\" \n20 minutes of calm thoughts and contract reading later, the stroke subprocess is down to 2% \n\"Right, so here's what we're going to do. In 20 minutes or so you're going to call him back and say there's a very thin black line running down every page. He will tell you the drum probably needs replacing – something he probably didn't have with him earlier because his vehicle was full of paper no one uses.\" \n\"I... OK.\" \n93 minutes later... \n\"You're probably looking for your printer,\" I say to the engineer who's scanning the room fruitlessly. \n\"Uh yes,\" he says, preparing to bullshit his way out of any accusation. \n\"I was just reading the contract. Apparently we still have 18 months still left to run on it.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Unless...\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"It is no longer economical to service.\" \n\"Uhhh yes?\" he says. \n... \n... \n\"And?\" he adds \n\"...\" I say, holding up my index finger \n>CRASH!< \n\"Oh dear,\" I say. \"I think I just saw a printer falling past the window after accidentally falling from a third floor window. I expect that it's now uneconomical to service. And perhaps your car has suffered the same fate?\" \nThe engineer dashes to the window. \n\"No, it's just the printer,\" he says, with a tinge of triumph. \n\"And yet..\" I say, holding up my finger once more. \n... \n>CRUNCH< >CRASH< >Crash< \n\"Oh dear. I think I just saw security's printer after falling out a fifth floor window, hit the window mounted air conditioning on the fourth floor. It sounds like both units then fell onto your vehicle – making pretty much everything uneconomical to service.\" \n\"You think you...\" he sneers. \nI hold up my finger once more. \n\"But wait!\" I say \"Is that the sound of 20 boxes of paper being opened and 100 reams of paper being handed out to staff to bash the engineer who has stolen so much from us in the past?\" \n\"I...\" \n\"And just so you know – I think the lift is locked out,\" I say. \"And I suspect the stairwells are full of people carrying reams of paper.\" \n\"WHAT DO I DO??!?!!\" he gasps. \n\"There's always the window...\" \n"}

It's where you say something that everyone thinks 'by accident'.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Incompetent? I never called you incompetent!\" I blurt. \n\"What?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Incompetent. I never called you that!\" \n\"I didn't say you did!\" the PFY shoots back. \n\"Oh, my mistake, I must have misheard you. ... And that is a Freudian slap. You can call someone names and totally get away with it just by denying it completely. You can even do it twice if they say 'What?' like the PFY did.\" \n\"I'm... not sure I follow?\" the Boss says. \n\"It's just a way of changing the topic. They think they have you on the ropes and you call one of them a sheep worrier. By the time they've bought the meeting back on track you'll have had time to think of a good response to their questioning.\" \n\"What if I can't think of a good answer to their question?\" the Boss asks, sounding even more worried than when we began the conversation. \n\"Just ask for a barley sugar because you think your diabetes is playing up. Then close your eyes for several minutes and don't answer any questions.\" \n\"Will I have to sign anything?\" the Boss asks, fearing a perjury trial looming in the near future. \n\"What, with the effects of diabetes making your extremities numb?!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"Look,\" I say. \"You've got nothing to worry about. You weren't even here when half of the accidents happened. They're only interviewing you to say that they've done a comprehensive interview of all employees.\" \n\"Yeah,\" the PFY says. \"They're looking for the big fish, not the small fry. You have nothing to worry about.\" \n\"Well, as long as you've never pirated a movie, viewed dodgy internet porn – even accidentally – or posted anything that might be considered hate speech to any online discussion forum.\" \n\"WHAT?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Well, these people are representatives of the legal community. If they uncovered a crime they'd be duty-bound to report it.\" \n\"What?\" he gasps again. \n\"Look, don't panic. Everyone slips up now and then. It's not like they're going to search your workplace computer or phone your wife or anything.\" \n\"Probably,\" the PFY adds. \n\"WHAT?\" \n\"Oh, just to ask her if she's witnessed any criminal activities. They probably don't even care about that.\" \n\"I don't think I can go through with this!\" the Boss says. \n\"You'll be FINE!\" I say. \"And if it starts to look like it's going pear shaped, just hurt yourself a little bit so you have to go out and get some first aid. They can't deny you first aid.\" \n...half an hour later... \n\"How's he doing?\" I ask the PFY, who's watching the interview proceedings over CCTV. \n\"He asked for a bag of barley sugars and then ran headlong into the wall,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"Well, on the plus side he has proved how often workplace accidents can occur...\" ® \n"}

It could be electrical interference, a rogue system process or just a sticky key. Sometimes it's just a perfect storm of one or more of those things,\" I explain. \n\"And sometimes it's just the alignment of the stars – a wrinkle in the fabric of the holistic user experience,\" the PFY says wistfully. \n\"That all sounds a bit … esoteric,\" the Boss jokes. \n\"Not really,\" the PFY responds softly, looking around again. \"Sometimes … things happen. No one knows why, but they do. It's not software, it's not hardware, it's just something that happens. And it does happen.\" \n\"Are you implying there's something … other-worldly?\" \n\"I don't know what I'm implying, but I do know that sometimes things just don't work. Things that have worked for years suddenly stop working for no reason. No matter what you do they will not work. The Gods of IT are frowning upon us. And the only way to appease the Gods is …\" \n\"You're not proposing to murder someone just to stop spell-check defaulting to US English are you?!?!\" the Boss splutters. \n\"Of course not,\" I say. \"That's probably just a broken finger's worth.  Anyway, we hardly need to resort to human sacrifice with the deep-fried food industry cornering that market.\" \n\"So what are you saying?\" \n\"Something has upset the natural balance of the IT Universe,\" the PFY intones gravely. \n\"Something like what?\" the Boss asks, nervously. \n\"I don't know. A Mac in the Beancounters' office or maybe a PC in the colored coloured pencil office.\" \n\"I don't understand what you mean.\" \n\"It doesn't matter – we're just looking for something that shouldn't be happening – something unusual enough to have disturbed the fabric of time, space and IT.\" \n\"That's a fairly broad category. You couldn't narrow it down a little?\" the Boss asks. \n\"It's hard to describe.\" \n\"Maybe the Helpdesk would know? They said that unusual stuff had been happening today.\" \n\"Wait – you called our Helpdesk … and someone answered?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Uh – yes. The guy said there'd been a lot of unusual things today and that he'd pass the message on to you. And he told me to make sure I wasn't using someone else's Word template file.\" \n\"Wait!\" I say. \"You called the Helpdesk, someone answered … and they gave you a solution that might actually work?\" \n\"Yeah. He told me to call him back on his direct line if you weren't available.\" \n\"HE GAVE YOU HIS DIRECT NUMBER?!\" the PFY gasped. \n… \nSo we have our anomaly. The PFY and I wander through to the Helldesk to find the person who's been causing all the trouble. \n… \n\"Oh hey guys!\" he chirps, as we enter. \n\"Derek?\" the PFY trembles. \nFOR IT IS DEREK, HOLDER OF THE ORDER OF MERIT FOR HIGHEST NUMBER OF USER MACHINES TOASTED IN A SINGLE GROUP POLICY CHANGE, KEEPER OF THE HAMMER, A BASTARD'S BASTARD! \n\"Guys!\" Derek chirps again, chirpily. \n\"What …?\" the PFY stumbles, running out of words. \n\"Am I doing here?\" Derek finishes. \"Well, I sold a bunch of dodgy crypto to a couple of beancounters at my company as a 'financial hedge' then decided to slip into the shadows for a while till things sorted themselves out.\" \n\"Till they were both taken in for embezzlement?\" the PFY asks. \n\"I had my hopes set on murder-suicide, but that's probably the way it'll play out,\" he admits. \"Anyway, I took this six-week contract on your helpdesk and it's amazing how cruisy it is to give users advice when you couldn't care about the outcome.\" \n\"That's our whole life you're talking about,\" I reply. \"But I didn't know the Helldesk had any vacancies.\" \n\"Yeah,\" Derek admits. \"A bunch of them came down with Giardia around the same time I had that job at that water cooler company. Anyway, I expect I'll only be here for a couple of weeks.\" \n\"So you sold some questionable coinage and are hiding out here – at our place – till someone else gets the blame … at which point you'll return to work?\" \n\"Yup, it's a real busman's holiday .\" \nWhile Derek's explaining the virtues of consequence-free employment and also pointing out where we can find the water coolers at HIS Helldesk, we're interrupted by the arrival of the Boss and the Director who have heard about the dark magic\/voodoo that will fix the default dictionary issue … \n\"I just told those guys,\" Derek says, pointing to us. \"But I think they're leaving the company.\" \n\"Really?\" the Boss asks \"Why?\" \n\"Because our cryptocurrency is really taking off,\" the PFY replies. \n\"Could we get in on the ground floor of that?\" the Director asks. \n\"Of course you can!\" the PFY says. \"There's plenty to go around …\" \n"}

Daniel's the Company's new internal relationship manager.\" \n\"Our what now?\" \n\"The new Internal Relationship Manager.\" \n\"Did we have an old Internal Relationship Manager?\" I ask. \n\"No, it's a new position – hence the word new preceding the Internal Relationship Manager ,\" the Boss says testily. \n\"Yes, but it could be interpreted two ways,\" the PFY says. \"A new position, or a new person in an existing position. Because the last person accidentally ate something that disagreed with them.\" \n\"Like this powdered glass,\" I say, shaking a small bottle of fine white powder. \n\"Or this box of cage nuts,\" the PFY says rattling a small cardboard box. \n\"How would anyone acciden...\" \n\"Ignore them,\" the Boss says. \n\"So, what will our Internal Relationship Manager be doing?\" I ask. \n\"My remit is to work with divisions of the company to help foster workplace relationships. The Company's Board feels that there's been some disconnects due to the workplace separation of the pandemic so they're looking at ways of reconnecting disparate departments.\" \n\"Sorry,\" the PFY said. \"I may have slipped into a temporary coma. What was that again?\" \n\"My remit...\" \n\"Yeah, that's where I lost you the first time,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"What sort of skillset would you need for that role?\" I interrupt, before things get nasty. \n\"I have a Master's degree in Workplace Social Engineering.\" \n\" A Masters in Workplace Social Engineering! ,\" the PFY echos, in the tone of wonder. \n\"Tell me,\" I say. \"Will we be doing trust exercises and playing team games?\" \n\"Like murder in the dark?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No, no!\" Daniel says. \"I don't work with people directly – I help them put systems in place so they can work with each other to reach common goals.\" \n\"Oh yes,\" I say \"And how do you achieve that? Personality trait testing,  strength analysis, the six hats thing – then feed all that into a compatibility matrix?\" \n\"You sound like a bit of an expert in this,\" Daniel says glibly. \n\"I'm more an expert in management fads,\" I say. \"I see them come; I see them go. As a rule they last a month or two till someone in the organization holds a pillow over them till the struggling stops.\" \n\"And that's just the internal relationship managers,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Well hopefully I'll be able to change your mind – and give you some new tools to work effectively with other teams.\" \nI may sound like a broken record when it comes to working with other groups – but in my defence, those groups don't want to work with us either. Each area of the business has, over the years, developed a sort of herd immunity to the intrusion of people from other areas. This has culminated in \"antibodies\" (ie, complainers) who surround the foreign body and smother them in the powerful toxins of pointless questions, rumor, onions-in-their-belt stories and general \"that's-not-how-we-do-things\" -isms. Who knows what would happen to Daniel if he were to meet them en masse. \n\"We should have a meeting!\" I suggest. \"Get each area to send a couple of people along to really bring this idea to fruition!\" \nDaniel, whose degree apparently didn't include the paper \"Poison Chalice Recognition 101\" , likes this idea – and the resultant meeting is looking good. Several departments have sent their more fractious personalities and the accountants are represented by an Olympic-level stick-in-the-mud. \nDaniel kicks the meeting off with a history of group dynamics which is so thorough that it almost includes the discovery of fire. Several of the older attendees slip off to sleep during this – at which point the PFY and I realize that Daniel may not be the sheep in sheep's clothing we thought he was. \n\"...and so, when we work together in function-based, interdepartmental groups, we'll all have much more free time, and with free time comes the possibility of promotion,\" Daniel concludes. \nThere are murmurs of approval at the thought of more free time and money so the PFY have some spade work to do. While I'm trying to remember where I left that pillow, the PFY steps in. \n\"I for one can't wait,\" the PFY says. \"We'll finally get the chance to work closely with people and pool our resources to share the costs of any new equipment we might need.\" \nThe murmurs drop a little as people contemplate us identifying the need for their department to pay for our new coffee machine. \n\"And I'm looking forward to spending many profitable hours with my fellow workers,\" I say. \"It'll give me a chance to share my two new passions – of interpretive dance and unicycle knife juggling.\" \nI suspect the mental image of me cycling around an office in an overly tight leotard, tossing sharp metal around is enough to worry even the staunchest of supporters and a couple of test lunges is enough to convince the rest that a slight pay rise is no compensation for a poorly choreographed hospital pass. \nIn a matter of moments the complainers have woken from their slumber and several hands are raised in unison. \nI may not need that pillow after all. \n"}

Put a GPS tracker on the spoons.\" \n\"Can you do that?\" he gasps, in clear danger of wetting himself in his excitement. \n\"Sure. We'd need to get a teaspoon with a fairly large handle to put the tracker in, but I think we could do it.\" \n\"That sounds great.\" \n\"Oh, but hang on, we won't get any budget to do that,\" the PFY says. \n\"Just use the miscellaneous expenses budget,\" the Boss suggests offhandedly. \n\"Oh, we spent that all on getting our SSL keys recut at the locksmith and then getting our hard drives hardened,\" I chip in. \n\"I guess I could maybe swing some money from my miscellaneous budget,\" he offers. \n\"Fine, it'll only cost a couple of hundred quid – in cash – to get the trackers plus whatever it'll cost for the big-handled teaspoons …\" \n\"Cash?\" \n\"Yeah, well, you probably don't want a paper trail if you're buying personal trackers.\" \n\"Ah, yes. Good point.\" \n… a week and 200 quids' worth of lagers later … \n\"That's amazing,\" the Boss gushes, rolling a teaspoon over. \"You can't even see where you opened it. How did you glue it back together?\" \n\"With thermal paste,\" I say. \"The good stuff.\" \n\"How do I switch it on?\" he asks. \n\"It's already on.\" \n\"And … how does it work?\" \n\"We installed an app on your phone which will alert you when a spoon leaves the tearoom,\" I say. \"Plus or minus 15 meters.\" \n\"So … I could …\" he says, leaving the tearoom. \nMoments later I hear his phone ping distantly down the corridor. \n\"This is GREAT!\" he enthuses, returning to the room. \"But does it work outside the building?\" \n\"Outside the building it should be even better. It'll locate the spoon to within three meters, give or take, because the signal's not impaired by the concrete in the building.\" \n\"I'm going to try this!\" he says, breaking for the exit. \nHalf an hour later he's back. \n\"THIS IS AMAZING!\" he cries. \"It sent me a message every ten minutes with the location of the spoon. It's only a matter of time – we'll find the spoon thief!\" \nOr maybe not. It's only a matter of time before the Boss realizes that the find-my-spoon app is really a find-this-phone app and the game's up. And it's a bit dependant on knowing when a spoon leaves the room, which is where the PFY's tearoom camera has been so useful. Streaming the boss's camera and mic feeds back to us is also useful … \nThe next day the Boss is back in Mission Control. \n\"This isn't working,\" he says. \"I had Steve take a spoon with him when he went to get pizzas yesterday and nothing happened.\" \n\"He can't have been using the right spoon,\" the PFY says, in a stroke of genius. \n\"The right spoon?\" \n\"Yeah, only one of them is tracked because of the high cost of the subminiature trackers.\" \n\"Can't you track them all?\" \n\"If you've got another thousand quid.\" \nThe Boss balks at spending more cash on tech to track spoons, and we're in the clear. Until … \n… the next day … \n\"I sent Steve back to the pizza place last night with ALL the spoons and nothing happened!\" he fumes. \n\"Really?\" the PFY responds, looking up from his desk. \"That is unusual.  But wait – you didn't put the spoon in the dishwasher did you – it's not dishwasher safe!\" \n\"I …  Wha … OK, I think we should open all these spoons up so I can see that tracker.\" \n\"Yes, you're probably right,\" I say, stalling. \"We need to know whether this is an intermittent problem or whether the dishwasher is doing harm – as I thought we used the dishwasher in conjunction with hot beverages to heat the thermocouple to charge the tracker.\" \n\"We did,\" the PFY concurs, still tapping away on his desktop, \"as well as a tiny autogyro to convert the stirring movement into electricity. Maybe it's just been idle too long.\" \n\"Steve took them ALL with him when he >PING!<\" \n\"What's that?\" I ask. \"Is spoon back online?\" \n\"It … seems so,\" the Boss says. \"And it's just outside the building.\" \nThe boss dashes off while the PFY continues to feed coordinates into the phone. \n… \nIt was just a matter of time, really. \nSooner or later if you're focused on your phone screen instead of your surroundings you're bound to forget to look both ways before crossing the street. \n\"There's been a terrible accident,\" the PFY says, closing his mapping app. \n… \n"}

OSI model?\" HR asks. \n\"Yeah. You see, what you're after is presentation layer but we're more ... physical layer.\" \n\"I don't know what you mean.\" \nWell, I think what you would see as optimal is us having a user interface which has been tailored toward listening to pointless stories – an interface which has an almost infinite 'listen-timeout'. \n\"This would be an interface which could take packets of information, delivered out of sequence and which contain a lot of spurious data. You'd want it to take those onions-in-our-belts data, which might not meet even the most basic of data sanity checks, and from all of the above data assemble a request.\" \n\"Go on,\" HR says, slightly confused. \n\"And you'd then like that data translated into an action plan, execute that action plan, and then compose a response packet which has been tailored to delivering coherent data back to the client.\" \n\"I ... think I understand what you're saying.\" \n\"But you'd like that return data to be translated into small, easily received packets and have it delivered synchronously; able to buffer the response information whenever extraneous data – also with data sanity issues – is presented.\" \n\"I ...\" \n\"So, in the OSI model most of this activity occurs in layers 4 to 7 – which does the data sorting, assembly, parity checking, and discarding before presenting a concise request to our layer. We call these the Host layers – or, more commonly, 'The Service desk'.\" \n\"You mean the Helpdesk.\" \n\"If you like. In any case, the complainant is wanting us to operate in those higher levels of the model, which is not our area of expertise. We exist at the lower levels, presenting our data to the higher layers to present to the user. We don't really have a presentation layer as such.\" \n\"But surely you could ...\" \n\"No, that would be mixing up the layers. And that never goes well.\" \n\"I still think you should ...\" \n\"But our layer is optimized to the type of work we do.\" \n\"And yet your employment contract notes nothing about these 'layers' ...\" HR shoots back. \n\"It wouldn't. It's not a technical document.\" \n\"Exactly – so how about you do what you're supposed to do to make the problem go away and we won't start wondering which layer of HR it is – or isn't – that pays you.\" \n\"Okee dokee,\" I say, texting the PFY. \"I'll just wait here, shall I?\" \n\"What for?\" HR asks blankly. \n... 2 minutes later ... \n\"... ripped it from the wall?\" HR says to their caller. \n\"That'll be the network layer,\" I say. \"Or maybe it's the data layer.\" \n\"... a ...

Well done.\" \n\"It's not just any watch, it's a SMART watch!\" \nNGAAAARRGH! I lock in full auxiliary power but it's too late – I'm getting sucked in by this conversation's tractor beam. \nStill, I can't leave as I promised the PFY I'd bring him back a plate-load of onion bhajis. \n\"Ah yes,\" I say, feigning a sidestep. \"Still, that's a nice looking apple turnover. Which species of apple do you think they use in them?\" \nThe Boss is having none of it. \n\"And the great thing about this is that it was so cheap! And it has a Gorilla Glass face.\" \n\"Sounds like they knew their customer,\" I say. \"And his wife.\" \n\"It talks to my smart phone,\" he says, missing most of that. \n\"You mean your phone,\" I say. \n\"Oh I suppose. But it IS the latest iPhone. I queued up at midnight for it.\" \nI resist the urge to shout at him that the only thing you should be queuing for at midnight is a kebab. \"Uh huh.\" \n\"You seem disinterested,\" he says. \n\"These things,\" I say, pointing at his watch and phone, \"are the mayflies of the IT world. Their lifetime is so short that even the terms you use to describe them are obsolete in no time.\" \n\"They last for years!\" \n\"They COULD last for years, yes – but they won't. The excitement half-life of them is measured in weeks, so by this time next year you'll have the new latest iPhone and a different cheap smart watch.\" \n\"And I suppose you're above all that?\" he snaps back with more than a hint of sulkiness. \n\"No, no, we make the same mistakes, just in different ways. We implement so many ideas that seem to have useful and practical applications but in practice turn out to be nothing more than cheap trinkets.\" \n\"Like what?\" he asks. \n\"Take the LED lights in our office which were replaced last year,\" I say, grabbing a bunch of bhajis before the Boss can snaffle them all. \n\"Everyone's were replaced last year,\" he says. \n\"Yes, but ours were replaced with multicolor addressable LED lamps,\" I say. \"The idea was that we could use the lamps to indicate the status of our systems. If the lights were white then everything was normal; green, things were normal but the trend analysis criteria indicated routine maintenance was required; orange, something important had failed; and red, critical system failure.\" \n\"That sounds like a good idea.\" \n\"It does, doesn't it?\" I say, tucking into a bhaji. \"Only in operation the lights were mostly white or green. We might have seen orange once – but we knew the outage was coming before the lights had changed.\" \n\"So you changed the lights out.\" \n\"No, because then we went into the next idea. We linked the lights to the number of items in our work queue – only we found that when we needed to work on a piece of hardware we'd delete all the jobs in the queue so that we'd have enough light to see what we were doing.\" \n\"And so you changed the lights out then?\" \n\"Didn't even consider it,\" I reply. \"We configured the light fittings to be on or off to make a room-wide binary clock with the front row being hours and the back row being minutes – which just meant we'd move around desks a lot; we had the light color reflect the amount of work time left in the day – red in the mornings, green in the mid-afternoon, white at home time; then we linked the lamps to a couple of microphones and used it like a massive audio spectrum analyzer.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"Completely useless,\" I say, tucking into another bhaji as we head down to the office. \"All these things were just a fancy solution looking for a problem. We should've stuck with normal lights that are on when the switch is down and off when the switch is up. Those lights will just keep doing what they do, and all we have to do is accept that. Just like a watch is for telling the time and a phone is for communicating with people.\" \n\"So just to be clear – you changed out the lights?\" \n\"Nope. I decided to use the lights for something truly pointless. I linked them to the PFY's electronic mood ring – another piece of pointless technology. When they're white, he's in a good mood; green, he's OK; orange, silently fuming; and red – well, you shouldn't be in the room.\" \n\"And we paid good money for those lights?\" the Boss snaps, a touch annoyed. \n\"We paid good money for your 'latest iPhone,' didn't we?\" I ask as we enter Mission Control. \n\"Has someone got a new iPhone?\" the PFY asks as the lights turn orange. \n\"He has,\" I say, pointing at the Boss. \"And he took the last five onion bhajis.\" \n\"Why have the lights gone red?\" the Boss asks. \n"}

The worst part is that the project is funded from the infrastructure budget, which means that the longer it takes to deep-six it, the more cash will be burned in the RFP process. \nAnd the vendors concerned couldn't give a rat's ass about whether they get the project or not. If they do, it's a pantload of cash with so few deliverables they're probably readying the magic beans right now. If they don't get the project, it's not like they put a lot of effort into it, as most responses look like replays of their responses to a recent RFP from another company. \nWhich is where the Boss comes in. Thinking there was money to be saved and glory to be had, he plagiarized the aforementioned recent RFP, \"tailoring it to our needs\" with a series of a poorly executed replace-alls, cut-and-pastes, and section deletions. \nSuffice to say his replace-alls didn't use any regular expressions (as the Boss's understanding of that term extends only as far as \"I'll have another biscuit!\" ) and the document is littered with large numbers of \"SHALL NOT NOT\" clauses. \nThe respondents loved this. It gives them the ability to reinterpret each clause either as written or as a double-negative typo. \n\"Do we have a top three?\" the Boss asks, blundering into Mission Control. \nAnd that's the other thing. If you're going to plagiarize an RFP, you should at least know enough about the topic to understand what you've asked for and what the responses mean. \nWhich is where the PFY and I come in. \n\"Top three – we certainly do. I'm thinking 'More Human than Human' by White Zombie, 'Infected (Extended Mix)' by The The, and 'Rise', Public Image Ltd. We're talking music to read tedious RFP responses to, aren't we?\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Oh, you mean the respondents?\" I respond. \"Well, let's see. We have several respondents from out-of-country, thanks to your publishing the RFP publicly and not just inviting responses from selected vendors. Those responses have been run through the functional translator.\" \n\"The functional translator?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The shredder,\" the PFY says. \"A machine which translates one form of rubbish to a different form of rubbish.\" \n\"I … see …\" \n\"I also 'functionally translated' the submissions of everyone who replied in paper given that the RFP clearly said answers had to be electronic.\" \n\"Did I put that in there?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No, the person you plagiarized the document off did. They also had a section which indicated that no respondents would be paid for costs involved in the assembly of their response.\" \n\"Oh. Good.\" \n\"No, no, you deleted that section. But the good news is that you left the document history intact, so everyone can see that you deleted it. They can also see that you probably spent an entire day changing the highlight, underline and bolding of every title and subtitle instead of just editing the document styles.\" \n\"Is it bad?\" \n\"The document style?\" I ask. \"I've seen worse. Not many, but I have seen worse.\" \n\"I mean the missing clauses,\" the Boss asks worriedly. \n\"Well, you're probably on safe ground if you accept the response of one of the respondents,\" I say. \"Then all you have to argue is that it's common practice that the costs of creating the response are borne by the respondent.\" \n\"OK. Let's do that then,\" he says with a modicum of relief. \n\"Righto then! Which one do you want to accept, the one costing 220 grand, the one costing 180 grand plus implementation costs – charged at 120 quid an hour – OR the one costing 185 grand which doesn't mention any implementation costs?\" \n\"Sorry?\" the Boss asks. \n\"220k, 180k+ or 185k+,\" I summarize. \n\"We … don't have that much money!\" he gasps. \n\"Plus the annual license fees,\" I add. \nThe Boss is no doubt contemplating whose role will be disestablished to pay for part of this expense – and\/or the legal action arising from not accepting one of the responses. \n\"But …\" he blathers pointlessly. \n\"Unless …\" I say. \n\"Unless?!?!\" he gasps again, reaching for a proffered straw. \n\"Unless there were a late respondent to the RFP,\" I say. \"Someone who came in well under those respondents.\" \n\"Could that happen?\" \n\"You know, I think it could! I know of a local company who'd take 20k, deliver nothing, and never mention this again.\" \n\"You mean you?\" the Boss asks dryly. \n\"Myself and my assistant here,\" I nod. \n\"In that case I think I know a local company who'd take 15k,\" the Boss chips back, no doubt planning a visit to the Companies House website in the near future. \n\"I'm fairly sure the company you're thinking of would be wasting their registration fee – as they won't pass the technical review process. The PFY and myself are named as that team in the RFP.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"Oh no! I've just heard that the successful company has just had some additional COVID-related expenses and their price has increased to 21k!\" I say. \"Should we wait another ten minutes to see if there's any inflation adjustment to that price?\" \n\"I … I'll take it.\" \n\"I thought you would. Should I … get them to send the invoice to you now?\" \n\"I …\" \n\"Oh, it looks like they'll need a deposit.\" \n\"What for?\" \n\"P&G, stamp duty, window tax?\" \n\"How much?\" the Boss sighs. \n\"How much you got in your man-bag?\" the PFY asks. \n"}

He has a resting belligerence level of about 87 percent, which increases rapidly in the presence of software salespeople. \n\"And it turns out there's a surprising amount of sugar in lager,\" I suggest, \"which is how he medicated himself before that meeting.\" \n\"He fell asleep on the table,\" the Boss says drily. \n\"Diabetic coma,\" I shoot back. \n\"That doesn't explain why you were drinking.\" \n\"I didn't want him to develop a substance abuse problem by drinking alone.\" \n\"And what, you had a sympathetic diabetic coma?\" \n\"I have no recollection of those events. But what concerns me is that you're implementing a financial system on the basis of a single meeting.\" \n\"We've had DOZENS of meetings!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"Really? Was there food at them?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Ah, right then, as you were.\" \n\"So Gerard, Daniel, David and, um, Karl would like to get started today.\" \n\"Really.

That's what I'd have done, to maximize the effect. \nTo his credit, the Boss doesn't start weeping immediately – but then I haven't asked the guys about ongoing license fees or maintenance contracts yet. There's still time. \n\"That seems a little steep for just executing a perl script,\" the PFY says after turning the page around. \n\"There's a lot more to it than that!\" Karl replies. \n\"Yes, the uh, encoding, bounds checking, parsnip insurance, burnishing fees and the like,\" the PFY says. \n\"They're just routine data translation costs,\" Karl says. \"We have this with every contract.\" \n\"Yet they're not included in your 'comprehensive' contract?\" I ask. \n\"It's not possible to include them as each data translation is different from the last.\" \n\"They're not even mentioned in your comprehensive contract, are they?\" the PFY ask. \n\"Some clients don't need them.\" \n\"So you can name some former clients that haven't had to pay an additional  – and exorbitant – fee?\" I ask. \n\"Uh …\" \n\"We'll take that as a no,\" I say as the PFY taps away on his tablet. \"And if you would, I think my assistant has a counter offer.\" \n\"Which is?\" Karl asks. \n\"Just give him a moment while he folds the paper …\" \nIt slides across the table … \n\"What was the counter offer?\" the Boss asks, as Karl and his entourage lose some of their former enthusiasm. \n\"Was it your home addresses?\" I ask. \"Because I saw him looking them up.\" \nKarl et al refuse to answer, gather their things up, and go. \n\"What was your counter offer?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I believe it may have had something to do with his medical condition, the brick under the table and how long it has been since his last lager …\" \n"}

Your hotdesk is nice and warm","Link":"\/2022\/12\/09\/bofh_2022_episode_23\/","Content":"Episode 23 To say the Company may have overplayed its hand in the post-COVID return-to-work thing is a bit of an understatement. \nSome companies decided early on that everyone should be back at work from day one. Others favored a staggered return to work, whilst others wanted their staff in at least three days a week. Then other companies said their staff could work from home so long as they had a couple of \"team days\" in the office each week to catch up. \nOur company decided on the chaotic-neutral approach of letting everyone decide what they wanted to do without requiring them to communicate the option they chose. \nAs expected, many of the institutional deadwood have never been seen since. It's possible they're holding down a second job – but if they are, it'll only be for the extra sick leave. \nNow the Company's getting concerned. As less people are actually showing up there's a general feeling that less people want to show up. Then there's all the new and expensive hotdesking furniture that our department purchased to try to encourage people back to the building – sitting embarrassingly empty. \n… \nOne of the main issues is, of course, that people know it's easier to slob around at home – where no one can see you – than it is at work. So whilst they can reluctantly drag themselves out of bed at noon to attend a Zoom call, they're not so keen on putting in eight hours at work with their pants on. \n\"We're paying a lease on all these printers and no-one's using them!\" the Boss burbles. \"We need to get people in.\" \n\"Easy,\" I say. \"You just need to mention the Christmas bonuses.\" \n\"There aren't any Christmas bonuses.\" \n\"I didn't say you should offer bonuses – you just need to mention the money you're setting aside for the bonuses on a couple of online meetings. Word will get around. They'll be all over you like sycophants at a Tesla launch.\" \n\"Yes, but how do we get them to stay in?\" \n\"That's probably a Head-of-HR job. He'd maybe tease the staff by saying bonuses are delayed while the Company needs to do some … I dunno … dynamic personal performance metric recalculations? That should buy you a couple of months. Then maybe a couple of strategic redundancies to keep the proles on their toes – you know, carrot and stick.\" \n\"In this job market?!\" \n\"Yeah, that's why I used the word strategic. Fire a couple of pieces of the laziest kindling in our deadwood selection. Make sure they've been here for donkey's years and don't have a referee from this century.\" \n\"And …?\" \n\"And when a reference checker calls you, make vague hints about how high functioning they are – considering …\" \n\"Considering what?\" \n\"Oh you never say that. You just stop at considering and sort of trail off. Gush over them a bit, and in passing mention the company's policy of trying to find work for people with prescription medicine issues. When asked why you let them go, just say you can't go into detail …\" \n\"And what will this achieve?\" \nPeople will have second thoughts about their potential employability.   The next phase would be to suggest the Head Beancounter's trying to work out the travel component factored into people's salaries – now they're not coming in, maybe they don't need it. Then there's the office restructure. \n\"What office restructure?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The one where the Company drops workers and sheds a floor of the building.\" \n\"No one's told me about that.\" \n\"It was probably discussed at the same meeting as the bonuses. In any case, we'll be back to full numbers in no time.\" \n\"Ah. Right,\" the Boss says, the penny dropping. \"Only …\" \n\"… ?\" I ask, wordlessly. \n\"I don't know, but … isn't there … less furniture here than there used to be?\" \n\"Of course! There'd need to be if we're consolidating. We need to make room for the extra furniture from the floor we're vacating.\" \n\"But … that was just a pretend thing.\" \n\"Yes, but people would see it was never going to happen if we kept all the furniture.\" \n\"But it was new furniture!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"And that's what makes it so convincing!\" I counter. \n\"But we only just bought it!\" \n\"I know – and once word gets around that we've been dumping brand new furniture in the street for anyone to grab, people will really get worried.\" \n\"YOU DUMPED IT IN THE STREET?!?! IT WAS BRAND NEW!\" \n\"Well you said we had to do something.\" \n\"You have to get it back!\" the Boss snaps. \"That was a huge portion of our hardware budget.\" \n\"No, no, it was a huge portion of MY hardware budget. You don't have a hardware budget. You have a miscellaneous budget, an office supplies budget, an entertainment budget and a fake bonuses budget.\" \n\"Whatever. We need to get that furniture back.\" \n\"We can't – it's gone. Those gaming chairs went like hotcakes.\" \n\"You have to get them back!\" the Boss blurts, knowing full well that whilst purchasing items from the wrong cost center is verbal warning material, losing those items falls into the summary dismissal category. \n\"They're gone! Maybe you can buy some more with your office supplies budget,\" I suggest. \n\"I don't have that much money in my office supplies budget!\" he gasps. \n\"Well how much do you have?\" I ask. \"We could look on eBay. Meantime we'd take all the new furniture out of the small offices and put it into the open plan area, then drag the ancient furniture from the basement and put it in the small offices – that way it'd look like we'd not dumped any.\" \n\"I'm not sure that would …\" the Boss starts, not wanting to lose the top-of-the-line gaming chair that he thought no one would notice. \n\"Yes, but we can replace the small office chairs with stuff from eBay in due course.\" \nThe Boss reluctantly agrees to this and allocates a chunk of his office supplies budget to me to buy replacement chairs as funds permit. \nThe PFY, meantime, is helping the Beancounters install that new office furniture we sold to them earlier in the week. \nSo it looks like maybe there is a Christmas bonus after all … \n"}

We deal with them later. Right, so now you just need to answer the questions about recent travel, symptoms you or your close personal contacts have had, and then click on the Sign In button at the bottom. And you're done!\" \n\"It's a little bit clunky,\" the Boss comments. \nThe Boss is wrong – the app's not a little bit clunky. It's a lot clunky. Employing the principles of Lumbering Design, the PFY and I have built what is arguably the worst illness tracking app imaginable. That task itself is not for the faint-hearted, as the testing regime is brutal. We have, however, still managed to implement as many of the most-hated features as we can. \n>Bing!< \n\"What's that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"That's just the app giving you a reminder of the importance of social distancing, even though there's not a current outbreak or anything.\" \n\"Does it do that often?\" \n\"Only every hour or so.\" \n>Bing! Bing!< \n\"That's not been an hour!\" \n\"No that's just a health check warning, asking you if you have issues with smell or taste, and asking for the number of times you've coughed or sneezed in the past two hours.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"I'd have thought that was obvious. If it spots an increasing trend it'll mark you as potentially infected and send an alert to everyone in the company who has been within 25 meters of your location. In real time.\" \n… \nHow did we get to this stage? With less than a month left in the year the Board decided to make 2023 the \"Year of the Wellness Focus\" – and what better way to achieve this than by implementing a company health app? \nA health app that they didn't want to pay anyone to develop. \nEnter the IT Director with a brainwave … \n… \n\"Won't that get quite annoying?\" the Boss asks, apparently confusing the words quite and extremely . \"Can I stop it alerting people?\" \n\"Sure – simply get a health check and send the result to HR and they'll reset your profile.\" \n\"Do I have to get a health check straight away?\" \n\"Only if you want your access card to keep working,\" I say. \"It's linked to our security system.\" \n\"So what's to stop me entering zero into the coughs and sneezes counts?\" \n\"Well obviously the phone's listening for coughs and sniffles.\" \n\"It listens to us?\" \n\"Yeah, you know, like Google, Apple, Huawei, the NSA, GCSB, etc. If you're worried about it you just need to lead an uninteresting life – so in your case maybe now's the time to buy that MISSION ACCOMPLISHED banner!\" \n\"Who told you to listen to us?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The board did!\" I reply. \"We told them about all the gaps in other tracker apps …\" \n\"We were only too happy to help,\" the PFY adds. \"Our app has masses of extra safety features that the government one doesn't have!\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yeah – we created a bunch of codenamed features to improve safety and the board approved them all!\" the PFY blurts. \n\"Codenamed features like what?\" \n\"My favourite's LEPERBELL,\" the PFY says smugly. \"When you're marked as infected or potentially infected it'll unmute your phone, turn the volume to high and play the warning tone.\" \n\"What warning tone?\" \n\"The six minute extended mix of 'Infected' by The The – though we may have to change that for copyright reasons.\" \n\"Any other features?\" \n\"Oodles of them. We kept chucking out ideas and the board kept approving them!\" \n\"Like what?\" \n>Bing!< >Bing!< >Bing!< \n\"Like that low battery alarm. All that tracking and messaging can really take its toll.\" \n\"I've only had the app installed for an hour!\" \n\"Yes, but it's all in the name of safety. I'd acknowledge that low battery alarm if I were you – you don't want the app marking you as potentially dead, as it feeds back into the payroll system.\" \n\"Oh, right.\" \n\"There you go. And now you just need to click on CONFIRM, and then answer the 'Are you Sure?' question.\" \n\"But it's a double negative question.\" \n\"Is it?\" the PFY asks innocently. \"Did I mention you've only got 15 seconds to answer?\" \n\"This is ridiculous.\" \n\"It's what the board wanted.\" \n\"So if I leave my phone in my desk drawer none of this stuff happens. I won't come near people and it won't hear me coughing,\" the Boss says, exiting the office on a high. \nA high which lasts until he realizes he's locked out of the office. \nA high which comes back when he realizes he can use this as an excuse to leave the building. \nA high which goes away again when he realizes he's locked in the stairwell. \nOn a Friday afternoon. \nWith no phone. \nAnd the holidays looming … \n… \n"}

Someone's taken it!\" \n\"No they haven't,\" I reply. \n\"They have. It was in the office on the last day and it's gone now.\" \n\"Yeah, but everyone hates that printer. No one's going to take it.\" \n\"Besides, you'd need a truck to move it,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"Maybe one of the other offices took it!\" the Boss suggests. \n\"One of the other offices who already have that same printer – and hate it?\" I ask: \"Or one of the other offices who have heard about how much the other offices hate it?\" \n\"Well, someone's taken it!\" \nWe go out to the main office and sure enough the photocopier bay is empty and clear of its usual piles of unclaimed printouts. \n\"They left all the spare toner cartridges,\" the PFY observes, pointing at a tower of new cartridges on the shelves. \"You'd take those if you planned to use it.\" \n\"Maybe they took it … to destroy it!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"No, if they were going to do that they'd just wheel it out of the office and lever it over the balcony so it'd fall into the atrium.\" \n\"And they'd make sure the person who signed the printer contract was in the atrium at the time …\" the PFY adds. \n\"Well it's gone,\" the Boss states defensively, stalking back to his office \n… \n\"So what did you do with it?\" the PFY and I say to each other the moment the Boss is gone and we're back in Mission Control. \nAh. Interesting. \n… \n\"Who the hell would take one of those printers?\" the PFY says. \"They're a bloody nightmare.\" \nAnd he's right. Everyone HATES those printers – and the Boss for signing us up for them. Under a bit of time pressure, he made a couple of administrative blunders, the chief one being not passing the contract by the company lawyers because \"he'd signed dozens of these contracts over the years.\" \nSo now we have six behemoth printers, each on a five-year contract, ALL with the same excruciatingly high guaranteed minimum monthly page count – and you can bet that there'll be a clause in the contract to … \n\"There's a penalty for loss or intentional damage to the printer!\" the Boss gasps, bursting back into Mission Control. \"We have to pay the market value of the printer.\" \n\"And as it's a lease-only printer, they can pretty much pick the market value?\" I ask. \nThe Boss is silent. \n\"If it's really high we just need to make an insurance claim,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"We'd need to involve the company lawyer,\" the Boss says, ruefully. \nAnd I can see why he doesn't want to do that. On the one hand the Boss didn't involve the company legal team (of one person) in reviewing the contract before he signed it. On the other the company legal team (again, just one person) ended up with a gargantuan multifunction printer in their (his) tiny office. And on the third hand the costs of running that printer – with its guaranteed minimum monthly page count – come out of the legal department's coffers. The old stink-eye trifecta. \n… \n\"And you'd like us to fix this?\" I ask. \n\"Can you?\" \n\"It'll cost you. We'll be needing a couple of cases of premium imported lager …\" \n… \n\"Anyway, no one can print anymore,\" I say to the printer engineer later that afternoon. \n\"Yes,\" he says. \"The printer is back to factory defaults.\" \n\"ALL of them have gone back to factory defaults?!\" I gasp. \n\"It looks like it,\" he says. \"I can re-enter the print accounting information and settings.\" \n\"Okay, well when you've done this one, can you do Legal, the Beancounters, the Coloured Pencil Office, HR, Stores, then us – in that order. Some people are more important.\" \n\"I'm not sure I'll get through them all this afternoon, but I'll see what I can do.\" \n… the next day … \n\"Same again,\" I say to the engineer. \"No one can print.\" \n\"Yes, the machine is back to its defaults again. No one's been tampering with them, have they?\" \n\"I don't see how – as far as I can see these printers have tamper evident seals and only you have the master code.\" \n\"True,\" he says. \n… the next day … \n\"Maybe the battery on the motherboards is faulty?\" I suggest. \n\"It's possible,\" he says. \"But it should retain the accounting information if that happens – and that's gone too.\" \n… the next day … \n\"It happens at random times of the day or night,\" the Head Beancounter explains to the engineer, smelling an opportunity. \"They're totally unreliable …\" \n… the next day … \n\"I had a number of urgent contractual documents to print yesterday and had to go offsite to print them!\" our Lawyer lies. \"I think I need to direct you to the guaranteed performance clause of our contract …\" \n… the next day … \n\"We're just here to pick up six printers,\" a burly bloke says, ushered into Mission Control by the Boss. \n\"Right, follow me!\" I say. \n… later that afternoon … \n\"So they came for six printers, and they took … six printers,\" the Boss asks, confused. \n\"Well, they took six printers from the building, but they drove away with five. While they were disconnecting the fourth printer we snuck one back in off the truck and shuffled the others around to hide the gap.\" \n\"So we're in the clear – and they cancelled the contract!\" the Boss gasps. \"I can get us a better contract with a different printer company! I … oh, I'll just get you those lagers.\" \nThe Boss departs for the liquor store and I'm about to head back to Mission Control when the PFY signals me over to the stationery cupboard. \nAnd the multifunction printer therein. \n\"Remember last year, when there was a toner spill, and the Boss said he'd organise to get the carpet cleaned …\" \n\"Oh, yeah.\" \n\"And remember how he said he'd move the printer for the cleaners?\" \n\"Oooh yes,\" I say. \"And he forgot that he'd moved it …\" \n\"So we're planning to let a person with a terrible memory sign a contract with a new printer company?\" \n\"And your alternative is?\" \n\"How about we discuss that while we wheel this out of the office over to the balcony. But we'd better hurry, the Boss'll be down there soon …\" \nI sense a terrible workplace accident in the near future. \n"}

It also discusses current trends in decentralized and recentralized data and applications, the inherent dangers in deploying – or not deploying – data to the cloud and then makes some assumptions about where apps and data will end up in the future.\" \n\"Yes, I READ ALL OF THAT,\" the Director lies testily, \"but what I'm after is the main points – an executive overview.\" \n\"But it's a technical briefing document. It's not trying to convince you one way or the other about the technology, it's just discussing the various merits.\" \n\"I asked you to provide a report on the security of our stuff in the cloud.\" \n\"And I did that report,\" I lie. \n\"This isn't a report, this is just a generic overview of all systems-in-the-cloud.\" \n\"...of which our Company's systems are a small part,\" I counter. \n\"Yes, but I want something specific to our Company.\" \n\"You believe that our Company has a need for some special form of cloud-based security?\" \n\"No, but I want to know our systems are safe!\" \n\"Would it help if I scattered the Company's name in random locations in the document?\" I ask, thinking I'll need to add a couple of new response parameters to my ChatGPT session... \n... \nArse Covering 101 highlights the benefits of asking questions as a way of leaving the sort of paper trail that can be pointed at during your gross negligence HR process. The Director doesn't want an actual ANSWER to his question as much as he wants to be able to prove – at a later date – that he did ask it. Once asked, the hot potato of responsibility is then passed into the hands of someone else, leaving the Director's digits as cool as proverbial cucumbers. Lazy, work-shy cucumbers.

Large office vermin. Vermin with their own offices.\" \n\"It seems that if I don't use the word vermin it's not allowed to answer my questions,\" the PFY explains. \"You can also ask it about how much powdered glass you should AVOID eating in your sugar before it starts seriously harming you.\" \n\"It's all about the questions you ask,\" I add. \n\"Why the hell are you using AI for that in the first place?\" \n\"We have a lot of vermin in the building,\" I reply. \n\"That like sugar in their coffee,\" the PFY says. \n\"Why are rats drinking coffee?\" \n\"What rats?\" \nWe wait a few seconds for the Director's 2-bit processor to catch up. \n... \n\"So anyway, back to this AI thing.

I mean, some people would spend their days being annoyed by the constant interruption and the trivial and inane queries, but not me.\" \n\"It certainly seems to be the case,\" the Boss nods. \"According to the person who nominated you, you answered … five queries in three days, each time offering a solution which both worked and gave some insight into the nature of the problem.\" \n\"True enough,\" I concur. \"My assistant is a giver who likes to pay it forward.\" \n\"I … uh … Well, this all seems, uh, pleasantly surprising.\" \n\"Yes,\" the PFY says. \"Once I started redirecting email queries to ChatGPT everything got a lot easier.\" \n\"Redirecting email queries to ChatGPT?\" the Boss asks blankly. \n\"Yeah. So you open a ChatGPT session, feed it a mass of background information, append the user's query then package up the response with a reference ID in the subject line so that we can retain the context of the query for subsequent questions. The session is terminated if\/when we get an email with the words 'Thank You' or 'Perfect' or 'Solved' or the like toward the bottom of the message. That whole 'Thank You' bit has some teething issues at the moment, though, but we're working through it.\" \n\"So you're not actually answering questions?\" \n\"Of course we are. If someone asked you what the capital of Bulgaria was and you looked it up on the web and told them, surely you would be answering their question?\" \n\"I …\" \n\"This is the same thing – only better, because we're pipelining the solution to the user directly instead of involving a middle man.\" \n\"What about all your phone queries?\" \n\"The Operations phone system is unfortunately having issues,\" I chip in, \"and if anyone asks we're devoting a considerable amount of time to diagnosing the problem. We put a message on voicemail directing users to email – which we'll respond to if we have free time.\" \n\"So you're not working on the phone system at all?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Oh, we're definitely working on the phone system!\" the PFY blurts. \"We're working on a voice gateway into ChatGPT. The problem we're currently trying to address is how to maintain context. We thought we might be able to do it with a combination of calling number and voice recognition, but we've since decided that we're just going to answer the phone as a different person each time.\" \n\"You've … lost me.\" \n\"OK,\" I say. \"If your mouse doesn't work and you call me I'll tell you to check the battery. If you call me back and say 'it's not the battery' I'll know it's about your mouse – unless a considerable amount of time has passed – because I have the context of your previous call. If you called me back and I had no idea what you were talking about, you'd think I had Alzheimer's – which is another option we considered – or you might sniff rodent. HOWEVER, if the PFY answered instead of me and you said 'It's not the battery' he'd ask 'What's not the battery?' and you'd replay your interaction with me to give him context. So OUR plan is to have the phone answered by a different 'person' – that is, voice – each time it's answered. So the first call will be answered by 'my assistant' and the second call by 'me' and subsequent calls by 'Karl' or 'Nigel' or 'Karen' or 'Steve' or 'Lisa' et cetera until we run out of digitized voices – at which point we'll circle around to the PFY again.\" \n\"And if all of this works, you'd still expect to be paid for doing your job?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Of course.\" \n\"I think HR might have something to say about that. You're not even working.\" \n\"I'm sure they'll be OK with it – you know, the whole capital of Bulgaria thing.

He needs to go on Sensitivity Training course.\" \n\"He needs to go on what now?\" I ask. \n\"Sensitivity Training. He's upset a number of key staff.\" \n\"Which staff?\" \n\"That's not for me to say.\" \n\"Well, if we're just dealing with rumor...\" \n\"It was Peter.\" \n\"?\" \n\"Peter from PR & Marketing.\" \n\"Needy Pete?\" I ask. \n\"Don't you bloody start!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"He is high maintenance,\" I chip back. \"It's physically impossible for him to be in a conversation with anyone for more than 10 minutes without mentioning his radio career.\" \n\"Well, PR and Marketing did want someone with media savvy.\" \n\"Media savvy? He was a radio announcer on a small rural AM station! The local news would have been dominated by stories of calves born with two heads – and their subsequent marriage to one of the locals!\" \n\"I think regardless of what you say, he was fairly famous.\" \n\"If by 'famous' you mean reality TV 'celebrity' status then you're right - though most of them are an unkind comment away from looking up 'words of affirmation' on Google...\" \n\"I hardly thin..\" \n\"He is not key staff. You could replace him with a garden gnome and PR & Marketing would be completely unaffected.\" \n\"I'm not going to debate you on this - HR want him to attend Sensitivity Training.\" \n\"Will this training undermine his Insensitivity Training?\" \n\"His what now?\" the Boss asks, echoing my earlier confusion. \n\"His Insensitivity Training. It's an operational thing. In times of crisis you want real key staff to be able to keep their heads and ignore the ramblings of the masses. They need to be able to focus on critical tasks and disregard the inane drivel of the uninformed.\" \n\"And who are the uninformed?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Everyone but the PFY and me. But that's only in times of a crisis.\" \n\"And outside of a crisis?\" \n\"Everyone but the PFY, myself, and the bloke in the cafe that makes the onion bhajis – he's a pretty clued up guy.\" \nOne of the basic tenets of IT is never testing for an error condition you don't know how to handle. The Boss only has himself to blame. \nI break the news to the PFY when he gets in, but he takes it all in his stride. \n\"Oh, I've been on one of those before,\" he replies. \"It's a half hour lesson on reflective listening, then an hour of listening to people who you've supposedly maligned telling you how they felt. I've been looking for a reason to test my noise-cancelling EarPods...\" \nAt the duly appointed time, the PFY wanders off to his session and I settle in for some hard work on perfecting my Enemy Territory Rifle-nade skills. Barely an hour later, the PFY's back. \n\"They've called it off.\" \n\"Why's that?\" \n\"Well, Needy Pete was there to share his feelings, and before I could get my EarPods in he said that he struggled with self love.\" \n\"Uh-oh. What did you say?\" \n\"I asked him if he meant 'with' or 'during'.\" \n\"Ah. So I take they've now booked you in on the half-day Sensitivity Workshop then?\" \n\"Not too sure,\" the PFY replies. \"They asked me to wait outside.\" \n\"And you thought here was technically outside?\" \n\"Oh no, I nipped across the road for a pint. Then I came here.\" \nSometimes I cannot believe how well I've trained him. \n\"And you changed your voicemail message to the one where we're dealing with a critical network error?\" \n\"I did.\" \n\"Well we better generate that now then!\" I say, triggering the firmware update of the core router that I've been saving for a special occasion. \n\"Is there anything you want me to do?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes. It'll look better if you're offsite getting some replacement hardware so you may as well duck out pick up something for me that I just ordered from down the street.\" \nThe PFY disappears moments before the Boss arrives in the company of one of the HR contractors. \n\"Catherine has just been informing me of a disturbing situation,\" the Boss says. \n\"Mmm,\" I say, tapping away in a ssh window. \n\"She says Stephen was... are you even listening?\" \n\"Mmm,\" I say, typing away, Insensitivity mode on. \n\"There's been a serious incident.\" \n\"Mmm,\" I say again, still typing. \n\"LISTEN!\" the Boss shouts, as I look up. \"There's been a serious problem at the Sensitivity Training.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Stephen has upset Peter,\" Catherine says. \"He didn't validate his feelings, ignored his complaint and made jokes at his expense.\" \n\"But were they good jokes?\" I ask. \n\"This is a serious matter!\" Catherine snaps. \"Peter has resigned!\" \n\"I shouldn't worry,\" I chip back to her. \"I'm sure everything will sort itself out – possibly even quicker than you think. Oh look, all sorted!\" \nAs if by magic the PFY appears in the doorway carrying my recently purchased garden gnome. \n...two minutes later... \n\"Well that escalated fairly quickly,\" the PFY observes. \n\"It did indeed. I expect this time tomorrow we'll find we've been booked into the Full-day Sensitivity and Personal Healing Experience.\" \n\"Unless that core router firmware was corrupt,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"True – but just in case that doesn't work – where did you get those EarPods from again?\" \n"}

To hear the senior managers you'd think the Chairman had fallen in Dunkirk – rifle in hand – rather than in front of the boardroom drinks cabinet with a half-glass of sherry in his grasping fingers. \n\"True,\" I reply. \"But if you don't mind, I'd like to observe a minute's silence alone in my office – out of respect.\" \n\"Oh. Of course,\" the Boss says, slipping out the door of Mission Control. \n...1.5 minutes later... \n\"So, I was wondering if...\" he asks, pulling up when I look at him sternly. \"Did you...?\" \n\"I was only part way through the minute,\" I say. \"Now I'll have to start again.\" \n\"It's hard for all of us,\" the Boss says, slipping out again. \n…10 minutes later… \n\"Anyway,\" the Boss says, back in Mission Control as I lift my head and look at him in an annoyed manner. \n\"I keep getting interrupted by the phone,\" I say. \n\"Oh! I'll um…\" he says, gesturing at the door and leaving quietly. \n…Two hours later … \n\"I just thought you might have a moment now to…\" the Boss says, stopping when he sees the PFY raise his head in an annoyed manner while I look on disapprovingly. \n\"The black armband's milking it a little, isn't it?\" I ask when the Boss is gone. The PFY had heard about my minute's silence gambit and is obviously lining himself up for a couple of days of bereavement leave as well. \nSure enough, half an hour later the PFY has excused himself 'to cope with the loss,' and the Boss is back in Mission Control. \n\"I know you're still upset and everything,\" the Boss says kindly, \"but there's a Health and Safety issue that needs addressing.\" \n\"Is it about necking ¾ of a bottle of sherry every time you're near the boardroom?\" \n\"Uh, no. It's just that the, uh, late chairman was, uh, discovered by one of the cleaning staff.\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"After 11pm.\" \n\"And?\" I ask \n\"Well, it turns out he'd passed away several hours before then and had only been discovered then.\" \n\"Okay,\" I say, somewhat relieved that this wasn't a story about how he'd been found naked with an oven-ready chicken, a gallon of olive oil and an industrial vacuum cleaner. \n\"The discovery was quite a shock,\" the Boss continues. \"The poor woman was traumatized.\" \nThough not as traumatized as someone whose imagination immediately leaps straight to the oven-ready chicken scenario… \n\"Right,\" I say, pushing those thoughts from my mind. \n\"And the, uh, Wellness Committee suggested that maybe there was a way technology could assist in these circumstances.\" \n\"The Wellness Committee?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, it's a new Health and Safety initiative.\" \n\"Sorry, are we talking Health and Safety or 'Wellness'?\" \n\"Aren't they the same thing?\" \n\"No, Health and Safety is concerned with danger in the workplace, wellness is more about mental illness in the workplace.\" \n\"I... don't think that's right.\" \n\"Really?  So what else came up at the wellness meeting?\" \n\"I… don't think that's really the poin…\" \n\"Was there something about our diet and how the company should encourage veganism?\" I say. \n\"Nnno…\" \n\"They called it plant-based nutrition, didn't they?\" \n\"They have a point!\" the Boss finally snaps. \n\"So a big tick for veganism.\" \n\"The point is,\" the Boss says, \"the Committee was wondering if there were a way to, uh, monitor the health… of our… more at risk staff.\" \n\"You mean like a smartwatch which tracked ECG patterns and reported loss of activity?\" \n\"YES!\" the Boss gasps. \"That would be great! If one of the Board Members had a heart attack someone could go to the person's aid.\" \n\"Right – so we'd best build in a 10-minute reporting lag.\" \n\"What?!\" \n\"You're right, 20 minutes. If they're only brain dead they still have voting rights.\" \n\"We're trying to save people! Maybe if the watch thingy could widen scope of warnings it would be better. Say an orange alert if they're in imminent danger and red alert if the heart stops.\" \nI resist the urge to point out that if we implement the orange alert option we'll be getting them on the Wellness Committee once the PFY hears about the vegan food. \n\"And we could put a GPS on them, so we know where to find them.\" \n\"Unless someone were in a lead lined space – you know, like an X-ray suite, a CT scanner – or the boot of the PFY's car.\" \n\"Why would…\" \n\"How about an alternative option,\" I say. \"Tell the board there's a free gin tasting on the sixth floor then turn the lifts off. Anyone who makes it up the stairs gets a GPS watch and anyone who doesn't gets a free trip in a hearse. It's win-win.\" \n\"I don’t think that'll work.\" \n\"Well the PFY is looking into several openings in Forestry...\" \n"}

Apparently, he bought it because it claimed to double your workflow – which in his case is measured in biscuits per hour and waking nightmares about the evil Pantone colors. \nOnce he's back in the office I glance at his device – which would appear to be some sort of touchscreen-y digitise-ry HID device that'll be harder to master than a reverse Polish left-handed Dvorak keyboard with the key labels removed. Apparently, our man unearthed it behind his sofa after six months of it being left ON under a pile of books he'd not got round to reading … \nIf he were the only one … \nI still have a pile of reading material that I'll only get around to reading if I'm fortunate enough to have a hideous accident that leaves me with such limited movement that I'll only be able to pee out of – and turn pages with – a straw. Not the same straw obviously. \nHopefully. I must make sure the PFY isn't on my health notification list. \nAnd I too have a pile of oddball devices, bought with the intention of cobbling them together to make something truly spectacular – or at least more spectacular than a tangled pile of single board computers and peripherals … \n\"Here it is,\" our user chimes, handing his device over. \nI give the unit a thrice-over to ascertain that it has the build quality and aesthetic appeal of a third world bog roll holder, in the sort of brutal third world where two-ply bog paper has to be nailed to something heavy and immovable. \n\"Apparently it's going to be the next big thing in computing,\" the user burbles, focussing his attention on the PFY, presumably planning to on-sell the device to someone unsuspecting. \"It simulates mouse, keyboard and screen and can be programmed to respond to events. Maybe you should get one?\" \n\"I think I'd rather have laparoscopic dentistry,\" the PFY says. \n\"Okay, I see your problem,\" I announce, after pulling a CR2032 from the base of the unit and slapping it into a tester. \"The backup battery is flat.\" \nI neglect to mention the very conspicuous bulge in the plastic case, under which there's likely a monster LiPo battery, and slip the unit onto our multi-voltage high-current USB charge port. \n\"You could probably get one from Kelvin.\" \nAn icy chill fills the room. \nKelvin – Keeper of the Batteries – is not pleasant to deal with. \nOver a number of years Kelvin – Keeper of the Batteries – has amassed sufficient administrative advantage to make him someone with whom you don't want a run-in. His fiefdom includes the non-contiguous categories of Batteries, Furniture replacement & removals, Office Stationery, Stamps, Prepaid courier labels and Lunchroom supplies – to name but a few. Small stuff, but challenging when backed by a purchasing policy which refuses reimbursements. \nCross him once and you'll be drinking freshly ground super budget coffee (made with more ground than coffee) on a 1950s pedestal chair while your former – perfectly working – chair is sold in a disposal sale. Cross him twice and non-leaky pens will be a thing of cherished memory and your coffee will lurch further down the quality scale to the \"Pripyat\"  \"twice-roasted\" brand that comes in a lead sachet. \nAll this would just be considered \"staff oddness\" were it not for Kelvin's pedantry, which is so bad that his Company nickname is \"Autocorrect.\" \nOh, and Kelvin – Keeper of the Batteries – loves his forms. An application for a new set of whiteboard markers reads like an insurance claim – including a short history of the last markers, why we need more, what happened to the last ones, and, in the event that Kelvin doesn't have \"Red\" , \"Blue\" , \"Green\" and \"Black\" markers, what colors you'd like to substitute them for, from the list of: \"Green.\" Unless you just want \"Green\" in which case there's only \"Red\" . \nHe may operate out of a cramped storage cupboard, and may be universally loathed by everyone who deals with him, but Kelvin – Keeper of the Batteries – knows how to stick it to people. \n\"Would you like me to ring Kelvin for you?\" I ask, feeling the warmth radiating from the charging battery. \n\"Would you?\" \nI dial the extension of Kelvin – Keeper of the Batteries – and he answers after a long – intentional – wait. \n\"Yes?\" Kelvin sneers, seeing my number and recognizing me as the person who wanted several cards of the aforementioned CR2032s several weeks ago. \nHe'd said they had none. \nLater that night – using only the powers of a master key – I found he had been lying to me. \nEven later that night I had made sure he really did have none. \nAnd I took all the whiteboard markers too. \n\"I'm after some CR2032 batteries for a user,\" I say. \"It's for his home device. Well, I say device but it's more of a cute toy really. And he'd like some to take home for his kids' toys.\" \n\"Sure,\" Kelvin replies. \"Why don't you bring it down?\" \n\"Want me to take it?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Would you?\" our user asks again. \n\"Sure,\" the PFY says, grabbing the battery off charge with some barbecue tongs. \n\"I'm sending my assistant over with the device now,\" I say. \"Would you like me to hold the line?\" \n\"Yyyesss,\" Kelvin hisses, no doubt savoring the thought of sending the PFY away. \nI slip the phone on hands-free as there's a clunk from the other end – the sort of clunk you'd get when you tossed an overheating battery powered device against a sharp shelf rack before it fell down the back of a stack of stationery supplies. \n\"GET SOME COFFEE!\" I yell into the phone to the PFY as the fire alarms start sounding and Kelvin apparently runs off screaming. \"THE GOOD STUFF!\" \n… \n\"Now,\" I say, turning back to our user as we head to the fire escape, \"What else did you buy?\" \n"}

And, when you get something really burning well, heave it over the fence of some law enforcement or military facility. And guess whose business card would be found on it – strangely preserved from the heat?\" \n\"I … well … probably whoever put the parcel together,\" the Director burbles, envisioning the waterboarding of some poor pleb from the mailroom. \n\"Possibly,\" I respond thoughtfully. \"But isn't this your cigarette lighter?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"It's got your name engraved on it.\" \n\"What?\" he snaps, snatching it off me and turning it over. \"It does not.\" \n\"My mistake.

Some spreadsheet a bean counter has cobbled together with a lookup table of data that no one knows anything about that produces the right numbers every month so they're never touched. Or maybe an inventory system for bill-of-materials compilation which works perfectly, so long as all the input data is transcoded into EBCDIC and input in 72-character lines. \n\"I don't need to be able to do this myself,\" I tell the sales bloke after he encourages me one more time to take up their one-time offer (but before he offers me the set of steak knives). \"I'm happy to call and ask one of you to change our contact information and remove the fax number.\" \n\"Yes, but wouldn't you like the option to edit your return address information yourself?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"But you'd be able to do this so much quicker.\" \n\"Quicker than talking to you on the phone about this, or quicker than it used to be when I last called – about ten years ago – to get our telex number removed?\" \n\"I mean just quicker overall. You'd be able to change absolutely all your company details, name, address, postcode, contact information, any time you like and from anywhere you liked.\" \n\"How many times do you think we'll need to change our postal address in the future?\" I ask, trying a different tack. \"It's been pretty much the same address for more than 20 years. At this rate the only reason we'd want another change would be to update the planet field.\" \n\"But still, you'd have the option. And you'd be able to change a lot of other things too.\" \nI'm starting to think I'm not getting through to this guy. \n\"The issue is,\" I say, \"your software is precariously balanced between the three points of: (1) it costs nothing; (2) it requires no intervention on my part; and (3) it's used by an idiot. We don't want to change any of these things, because it will be a hassle.\" \n\"Yes, but …\" \n\"Look,\" I say. \"This program makes labels OK. The only issue is we want to change the return address information in the top right corner to remove the fax number – only this information is baked into the data file. Now I could, if forced to, probably hex-edit the data file to replace that whole field with spaces, but I thought it would be easier just to get a new data file – like I did about ten years ago.\" \n\"Yes, but you can do this yourself with the new software.\" \n\"You heard the bit about 'used by an idiot' didn't you?\" \n\"I …\" \n\"The program is only used once a month to produce address labels for the board papers, and it only produces ten labels each run. It would be simpler to hand-write the addresses, only we've got that idiot – so none of the board would get their board papers. We need to remove the fax number because a couple of board members keep trying to fax back their signed acceptance documents. Now I could just print all the addresses onto a single sheet of self-adhesive paper, but that would mean giving the idiot scissors. And yes, that would undoubtedly solve the idiot problem, but I'm looking for the simplest option. Surely you must understand what it's like to work with an idiot.\" \n\"… I do,\" the sales guy mumbles. \n\"Is it bad?\" I ask. \n\"Worse than bad. He's one of the senior managers,\" the sales guy blathers. \"He doesn't know anything about anything and he's put me in sales. SALES! I'M A BLOODY DEVELOPER AND I'M IN SALES!\" \n\"So you're a developer?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And you could fix our problem by just dipping into the old code and generating a data file.\" \n\"No, I don't think I could do that,\" he says, sanity returning. \n\"Are you sure you couldn't?\" \n\"I'm pretty sure I couldn't.\" \n\"Is it because it's a hassle?\" I ask. \n\"Uh …\" \n\"Would it be as much of a hassle as it would be if I were to ring your senior manager and ask him to go back through the support call recordings to find what his salespeople say about him?\" I ask. \n\"I …\" \n\"Or should I just email you our data file?\" \n\"I …\" \n\"And maybe send me a development version of the new code with no license requirements – in case we get a new idiot?\" \n"}

Though in his case I'd have led with the whole 'Rise of the Machines' theme.\" \n\"We just want to make better use of people,\" the Boss says. \n\"So the 'sausage factory' idea's definitely a no-go then?\" the PFY asks. \n\"We want a way of cutting the monotony out of people's lives so that they can focus on other things,\" the Boss says, ignoring the PFY once more. \n\"This meeting would seem like a great place to start,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"What are you suggesting?\" I ask. \n\"OK, what about lighting? Do you know how much time people waste every day just turning lights on and off?\" \n\"Ballpark? Say maybe 100 separate office spaces, maybe two seconds per switch, 200 seconds.\" \n\"And that's just turning them on!\" the Boss says excitedly. \n\"So … we're talking about … rounded up, seven minutes a day?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes, but EVERY DAY!\" the Boss blurts. \n\"What's that … less than 30 hours a year?\" I ask. \n\"Precisely!\" \n\"You could save more people-time by just getting the cleaners to unstick the ends of new toilet rolls,\" the PFY says. \n\"We're looking for things that AI can do,\" the Boss says. \n\"This conversation for a start.\" \n\"No, because it wouldn't have come up with the lighting idea!\" the Boss counters. \n\"It certainly wouldn't – because of the I in AI. Though I'm pretty sure it could have held up my side of this conversation, though.\" \n\"Look, we need to find some things for AI to do.\" \n\"Why?\" I ask. \"You've not gone and bought something have you?\" \n\"I … we … signed up for a large amount of AI,\" the Boss says, suggesting that AI arrives in boxes off the back of a lorry. \"It's the future.\" \n\"What are we talking – several thousand gigaspandrels?\" I ask. \n\"Probably,\" the Boss says, having no idea what I'm talking about. \n\"Well,\" the PFY jumps in, \"if we've got thousands of gigaspandrels, I hope you've at least signed up for a couple of tetrabytes of Mu-RAM, because we've got nothing remotely that fast on any of our servers – we're just using traditional hardware, and none of that emerging technology.\" \n\"I didn't go into the details,\" the Boss says, \"but it's all outlined here – maybe you can suggest some ways we might be able to make it help the company out?\" \nSure enough, the Boss has authorized a \"subscription\" to a nebulously defined SaaS AI platform which probably doesn't exist. The contract has more holes than a mechanic's underpants so I call the least larcenous of the Company's legal people and suggest he contact the AI company concerned and use the legal version of words like gigaspandrels and Mu-RAM while implying there's a new law about AI hate crime and targeting the mentally deficient. Within half an hour he calls back to inform me that the whole contract is just a misunderstanding and a thing of the past. \n\"Yes, but how we will use AI?\" the Boss asks. \n\"We don't need to use any AI. We only needed it because you paid for it.\" \n\"Yes, but could we use it?\" \n\"What for?\" \n\"TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER.\" \n\"You'll need to clarify what you mean by better. If we're talking about the day-to-day monotony of endless conversations about how AI is going to replace us all with more intelligent versions of ourselves then that sausage factory idea is getting my vote.\" \n\"AI will likely replace us with better versions of ourselves.\" \n\"Yes, but in some cases the 'intelligence bar' is set Olympics-Limbo level low,\" the PFY counters, \"and the people concerned were probably already locked in a battle for intellectual supremacy with the office house plants.\" \n\"Yes, but we need to show we're a company of the future!\" the Boss insists. \"We can't afford to be left behind while the rest of the world advances!\" \n\"And this is a company policy?\" I ask. \n\"It's come direct from the Board!\" \n\"We could just contract a small company that has some strong links with AI,\" the PFY suggests. \"Then we could say we're heavily into AI without having to actually do anything too drastic.\" \n\"Is it possible?\" \n\"I'll check and get back to you.\" \n… TWO DAYS LATER … \n\"How's that contract with the AI company coming along?\" the Boss asks excitedly. \n\"They've countersigned and couriered it back,\" the PFY says, with a similar level of excitement, tearing open the courier pouch on his desk. \"We're now in the sausage business!\" \n\"What?\" the Boss asks. \n\"AI. Artificial Intestine – the casings for sausages. Surely you read the contract. They're market leaders – and all developed not five miles from here.\" \n\"What!?\" \n\"It's a sausage factory. Like we discussed.\" \n\"I didn't bloody discuss a sausage factory!\" \n\"Sure we did. You paid for 20,000 conversion sessions.\" \n\"I paid for 20,000 CONVERSATION sessions. What the hell's a conversion session?\" \n\"You know, when the animal goes in the back and sausages come out the front.\" \n\"WHAT!? I didn't sign up for that.\" \n\"You did,\" I reply. \n\"We need to cancel that contract!\" the Boss says. \n\"I think I'll leave that to you.

That's just simple math that anyone can do. The PFY and myself have been doing that for years with an excel macro. You're number 37.\" \n\"37!\" \n\"Oh, 37's a good thing, according to the AI system the HR department has implemented. When looked at over a longitudinal time frame, the company's redundancy trend appears to follow a path of saving between five and ten percent in any given purge. They also tend to favor making around three low-paid redundancies for every medium-paid redundancy, and three medium-paid redundancy for every high-paid redundancy – unless there's a crisis, when it's more like 1:1 low\/medium and still 3:1 medium\/high.\" \n\"And you're #37, medium, so in the scheme of things relatively safe,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Well, that's reassuring,\" the Boss mumbles dubiously. \n\"Unless we have a recession.\" \n\"Aren't … we possibly … heading into a recession?!\" he gasps. \n\"We could be.\" \n\"So what does that mean?\" \n\"In a recession the company's policy has been to freeze employment and look deeper into areas of the business that may need to be trimmed. According to the AI's operating detail, consolidating business units and reducing middle-management positions is the recommended method for reducing cashflow – because middle management don't have hard-to-acquire skills and so are easier to replace after a recession.\" \n\"So where does that put me?\" \n\"In the top 50 you mean?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Uuuhmmmmm, about 7. The AI has a fuzzy logic gradient system for 'business-worth' which is a hybrid view of your total value to the company, DIVIDED by the amount of money the company pays for you and then cross-tabulated against any unique qualities you might bring to your position.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"You have the business worth of a corduroy ash tray,\" the PFY says. \n\"We don't have any ash trays.\" \n\"Not any more, no.\" \n\"Isn't corduroy flammable?\" \n\"It is, yes – which makes your business worth the same as that of a product we no longer need, that wouldn't work properly if we did need it,\" the PFY explains. \n\"A chocolate fireplace, if you like,\" I add. \n\"But we're probably not going into a recession,\" the Boss says. \n\"And that's probably not an iceberg.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Oh, I thought we were sharing famous last words,\" I say. \n\"Is there a way of … improving my … business worth?\" the Boss asks. \n\"You mean gaming the system?\" I ask, in hushed tones. \"The AI is coded to negatively value people seen to be gaming the system.\" \n\"I'm not gaming the system. I just want to know how I can improve my business worth.\" \n\"Have you got an undisclosed doctorate?\" the PFY asks. \"There's a definite bias towards higher education.\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Are you willing to take a pay cut to improve your business worth?\" the PFY asks. \n\"How much?\" \n\"For you >tappity< >tap<, 100 percent.

Close by, you can see an open hole in the server room floor where a floor tile has been removed. To your west is a ladder. \nTo the south is an exit door that you have no access to open, and which is securely locked. \nThe lights have gone out. \nThe emergency lights flicker briefly, then also go out. \nIf you continue, you may fall into a hole in the floor. \n> CRAWL N \nServer Room \nYou are in a server room in complete darkness. Beside you, you can feel an extremely cold, and completely unlit server rack. From inside the rack you think you can hear the sound of many bottles of lager vibrating. \nIf you continue, you may fall into a hole in the floor. \n> CRAWL N \nServer Room \nYou are in a server room in complete darkness. \nEXAMINE KEYS \nYou take your keys from your pocket and attempt to feel them in the almost total darkness. You feel your house key, your office key, 4 keys that open nothing – but which you keep to signify the importance of your Health and Safety role. Also on your keys is a small torch and a small penknife whose only purpose is to chew the bottom out of your trouser pocket. \nLIGHT TORCH \nThe torch, a gift at a Health and Safety tradeshow many years ago, glows faintly, partially illuminating the immediate area. \n> N \nServer Room \nThere is a wall there. \n> E \nServer Room \nYou are in a server room in almost complete darkness. \n> E \nServer Room \nYou are in a server room in almost complete darkness. Immediately to your east you can feel a bench. Under the lip of the bench you can feel a tiny button. \nPRESS BUTTON \nA wall panel, hitherto seemingly solid, slides back. \n> E \nComms Room \nYou are in a dimly lit comms room. There are cables all around you, lining floors and walls, protruding from racks and ceiling spaces. Many cables appear to date back to the days of thinwire ethernet and serial lines. \nBehind you a panel quietly slides shut. \n> E \nComms Room \nYou are in a dimly lit comms room. There are cables all around you. \n> E \nComms Room \nYou are in a dimly lit comms room. There are cables all around you. \n> W \nComms Room \nYou are in a dimly lit comms room. There are cables all around you. \n> S \nComms Room \n> E \nComms Room \n> CUT CABLES WITH PENKNIFE \nAfter a struggle you manage to cut a single cable, and nothing happens. \n> CUT CABLE WITH PENKNIFE \nYou cut a cable, nothing happens. Perhaps all these cables are abandoned. \nYour torch flickers ominously. \n> E \nComms Room \n> W \nComms Room \n> W \nServer Room \nYour torch flickers briefly, then goes out. \nYou are in a server room in complete darkness. \nIf you continue, you may fall into a hole in the floor. \n> W \nServer Room \nIn the darkness you cannot see where you are going and fall into a hole, fracturing your tibia. \n> N \nServer Room \nYou manage to painfully drag yourself from the hole across some floor tiles. \nIn front of you, you can see a dimly backlit intercom button. \nYou accidentally nudge a ladder, which falls across your left hand, breaking all the fingers on that hand. \n> PRESS INTERCOM \nPressed. A disembodied voice answers. \n> SAY HELP \nThe server room lights go on and a figure enters. \nIn their rush to help you they accidentally step on your right hand. Twice. Breaking three of your fingers. \nYou have 1 finger and 2 thumbs left; do you wish to continue? \n> NP \nSorry, I don't understand that. \n> QUIT \nYou have scored 0 points out of a total possible points of 0. An ambulance has been called. \n"}

I believe it was a couple of years old but had recently been retrofitted with a new motor and electronics.\" \n\"It had a 2kWh battery and 1,000W grid stacked core wound motor on it,\" the PFY says. \nI think I can safely say that no one in the room knows what a \"grid stacked core wound motor\" is – if it even exists – but it sounds expensive. \n\"I'm sure that we'll be able to determine what it was once we look at the debris,\" he says, dryly. \n\"Sadly …\" I say, before I'm interrupted. \n\"It was burnt up in the fire?\" he asks expectantly. \n\"It was burnt up in the fire s . The UPS caught fire, then the bike battery likely caught fire.\" \n\"Yes. How is it that you came to be moving a 100kg UPS through the building in the first place?\" \n\"500kg UPS,\" I point out. \"You're looking at the dry weight – without batteries.\" \n\"I stand corrected. How is it that you were moving a 500kg UPS through the building?\" \n\"We needed to get it to the freight elevator to take it to the loading ramp where we could perform the battery change.\" \n\"Because we're not allowed to do battery changes in the building anymore,\" the PFY adds, \"because YOU guys won't let us.\" \n\"Firstly, I'm an independent claims adjuster and have no say in your insurer's policy conditions; and secondly, there is likely a clause covering permissible battery activities.\" \n\"There's no clause,\" I say. \"But there is a whole new section in our policy covering batteries, their age and condition, maintenance requirements, service checking and history. And, as it turns out, it's cheaper to change the batteries every 2.5 years than to try and get a company in to re-certify the UPS and batteries together.\" \nAnd it's even cheaper to push the UPS out the window onto a pushbike with a stack of dodgy LiPo batteries cable-tied to it … \n\"How did this window come to be open in the first place? From your insurer's notes I see that all of the large pivot windows had been secured against opening?\" \n\"They had, but unfortunately the momentum of the UPS was something we'd not accounted for, so it broke the two screws which locked the pivot shut. It's a miracle it didn't break the glass.\" \n\"Yes, a miracle. Which screws did they break?\" \n\"Ahhhhhhmm … these ones,\" the PFY says, handing over a couple of sheared screw heads. \"No doubt you can run some stress test to determine what the shear strength was?\" \n\"As I mentioned, I'm an independent claims adjuster – I don't have access to that sort of forensic equipment.\" \n\"What equipment do you have access to?\" \n\"None. Your claim is below the threshold for forensic investigation methods – and, for that matter, a more senior claims adjuster.\" \n\"Really? What's the threshold?\" \n\"Twenty thousand British pounds.\" \n\"And our final claim?\" \n\"Nineteen thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight pounds.\" \n\"What are the odds?\" the PFY asks. \n\"What are the odds indeed. While I don't have access to forensic investigation equipment, I can, however, make recommendations to reassign this to a more senior claims adjuster – who would.\" \n\"Fair enough, and point taken. As an independent contractor, I assume you contract to various insurers.\" \n\"I do.\" \n\"And as a result you operate a private consultancy?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And cover your own expenses.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And in these trying times, in the long shadow of COVID and with new types of claims coming from climate change and with parts of the world at war I'm sure that insurers are looking at ways of reducing costs as well as limiting claims.\" \n\"It would seem a sensible practice.\" \n\"And no doubt some of those costs are your expense claims – your travel budget and meal allowances?\" \n\"I don't have a travel budget or meals allowance.\" \n\"What about overtime?\" \n\"It's a flat rate based on the tier of the claim.\" \n\"Is it a good rate?\" \n\"Not particularly – though if I can process eight claims in a day …\" \n\"Tell me, how did you get here today?\" \n\"On the tube.\" \n\"Are you sure you didn't ride your e-bike?\" \n\"I don't have an e-bike.\" \n\"Sorry, let me rephrase that while I show you our second UPS unit – which urgently needs a battery replacement.\" \n\"I think what you're proposing would push you over the threshold for …\" \n\"PER CLAIM threshold,\" I say. \"PER CLAIM. Now, perhaps my assistant can take you down the street to a budget bike seller while I pop into the storeroom and find a box of dodgy laptop batteries.\" \n\"You shouldn't be storing those in the building,\" our claims guy points out. \n\"THAT'S THE SPIRIT! And don't forget to pick up a bike lock and some cable ties. I'll see you back here in 20, once I've broken the heads off these screws …\" \n"}

There's a tractor beam which draws them through the multiverse to our company. \nThis guy, however, may actually be the biggest idiot in the building – and he's up against some fairly stiff competition. Not only has he no IT experience, he also seems to be on a one-man crusade to prove the Dunning-Kruger effect. \n\"I just need a hand to install my emission blocker,\" he says. \n\"Your … emission blocker?\" \n\"Yes, against the harmful radiation.\" \n\"What harmful radiation?\" the PFY asks, looking around warily. \n\"The blue light and EMF from my monitor.\" \n\"That's not a thing,\" I say. \n\"It is!\" he insists. \"They've proved it. Blue light can affect your sleep.\" \n\"Perhaps you should sleep at home then?\" I suggest. \"Or with lights off?\" \n\"Blue light is pretty harmful,\" he repeats. \n\"Yes, I've heard the UN is taking it up with the inventor of the sky,\" I counter. \n\"IT'S SCIENTIFIC!!!\" \n\"I don't think it is,\" the PFY offers dubiously. \n\"I consulted a health professional before I took this job. He looked at the office and recommended blocker screens, a negative ion generator, a Himalayan salt lamp and an ionic air purifier.\" \n\"And by 'health professional' you mean 'New Age retailer'?\" I ask. \n\"He's a SCIENTIST! He's got a doctorate!\" \n\"From an 'online university' operating out of a van on blocks in some waste ground in the middle of Eastern Europe?\" the PFY suggests. \"The one with the coursework requirement of sending cash in the mail?

The next person tripped over the mat coming to the aid of the person who tripped over the mat while putting up the sign about the mat.\" \n\"Yes, well these things happen.\" \n\"Would you like to hear about the third and fourth people who tripped over the mat?\" \n\"I think I've got the gist of it.\" \n\"Ironically, the fifth person was the Health and Safety rep.\" \n\"Yes, yes, but that just goes to show that we have some serious mat issues.\" \n\"We didn't have any mat issues until they put the sign up. It was wobbly, so they put it under the edge of the mat to stop it falling over.\" \n… \n\"Everyone sees with 20\/20 hindsight,\" the Boss sighs. \n\"Not our people. They got a heavier sign and someone tripped over it and so they put up a second sign to warn about the first sign,\" the PFY says. \"Idiots.\" \n\"But it worked itself out?\" \n\"I put the mat in the bin and sold the signs to a scrappy, along with some other office rubbish.\" \n… Ten minutes later at Mission Control … \n\"Where's my chair gone?\" \n\"Oh, that was some of the office rubbish I sold to the scrappy,\" I say. \n\"How am I supposed to work without a chair?\" \n\"You asked for a standing desk.\" \n\"Yes, but I don't want to stand all the time!\" \n\"Oh right, that wasn't clear. So you do want a chair?\" \n\"Of course.\" \n\"Right, so, do you want a carbon neutral unit? Or do you want a brand-new one – brimming with arguably harmful VOCs?\" \n\"I … uh … the carbon neutral.\" \n\"Great choice! I know a scrappy who can source one of them for you at a good price. Now, do you need your desk adjusted?\" \n\"I … maybe?\" \n… Two minutes later … \n\"I just thought I'd stop by on the way back from getting myself a cup of tea\" the Boss lies – Mission Control being nowhere near the water boiler – \"My lights don't seem to be working.\" \n… \n\"Yes, I had my assistant remove them.

Instead, he wants the PFY and I to perform magical triangulation of field strengths to find the person – the sort of detective work which is usually restricted to procedural dramas that will link it to the IP address 382.27.915.12 which will translate – through the internet address book – to the office next door. \n\"You must be able to locate the source!\" he insists. \n\"We could, but the problem is that within buildings the signal strength varies due to the building structure and mass. Where there's a particularly dense mass – like the lift well, the services risers, or our HR department, the signal is attenuated.\" \nI know the Boss wants to know if \"attenuated\" is good or bad, but he doesn't want to appear ignorant. \n\"So...\" he asks. \n\"We could go round the building from the outside and see where the signal is strongest?\" \n\"Okay, do that then.\" \n10 minutes later in the pub... \n\"So, we've probably got half an hour till the Boss starts wondering where we are'\" I say to the PFY. \n\"We could get a full hour if we keep him busy 'reducing the signal interference'.\" \n\"You mean getting him to turn all those electrically noisy lights off, make sure no one uses the microwave, get everyone to turn off their Bluetooth?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n...an hour later... \n\"How's it going?\" the PFY asks as I peruse the wireless offerings. \n\"He's obviously encountered the culprit because the SSID has changed to ...IsAnInbredFerret, then ...IsASheepworrier, then ...WearsStupidPants.   Actually, it's currently alternating between those last two.\" \n\"Let's have a look,\" he says. \"Wait a minute...\" \"What?\" I ask. \n\"Different hardware IDs!\" \n\"TWO PHONES!\" \n\"Two OR MORE phones,\" the PFY counters. \n... \nThe Boss isn't happy. There are now at least four different hotspots with his name associated with them – none of which would be considered flattering. One of them even has a login screen which has an I-am-not-a-robot verification process where the user has to select the image which most resembles the Boss – with an image selection consisting mainly of rubbish bins, vacuum cleaners and garden gnomes. \n\"We've done what we could!' I say, \" but we have to consider the possibility that there's more than one person involved. \n\"More than one how?\" \n\"Well when we were performing our building exterior survey...\" \n\"From the pub,\" the Boss inserts needlessly. \n\"We surveyed the building from a number of external locations.\" \n\"The three pubs within 100 yards of the building,\" he again interjects. \n\"Yes, yes, but you'll be pleased to know that only one pub could see an SSID associated with you.\" \n\"Well, I suppose that's something.\" \n\"Unfortunately, it was the words 'I'll trade my company M1 laptop for a Psion' and your desk phone number.\" \n\"This has got to stop before it becomes public!\" \n\"It's very difficult to stop something like this – and with half the workforce on portable equipment I doubt it's much of a secret.\" \nWe're interrupted by the phone. \n\"Yes?\" the Boss says ... \"I think you have the wrong number... No, I know, but you have the wrong number.\" \n>clatter< \n\"MAKE. IT. STOP,\" he looks pointedly at the PFY and me. \n... \n\"OK, so, we're just going to crank up the signal strength to uh... >tap< >tap< >tap< 110 percent, select >click< all channels, all frequencies, >clicky< and YES, I REALLY want to do this. Okay?\" \n\"Okay!\" the Boss snaps. \n\"And, uh, and should we make the changes permanent?\" \n\"Of course.\" \n>CLICKY< \n\"Hmm,\" the PFY says about a minute of silence later. \n\"What? I can't hear anything.\" \n\"Yeah. No keyboards clicking, no phones ringing.\" \n\"That'll be because our mesh is overpowering all the other wireless.\" \n\"...in the building,\" the Boss says. \n\"Well...\" \n\"What have you done?\" \n\"Well I made all those SSIDs disappear by overpowering them on all channels. And the new SSIDs are saying you're not a gobshite.\" \n\"TURN IT OFF!\" the Boss says, after a brief moment of realization. \n\"I can't. We made the changes permanent. We'd have to get to every unit in the mesh, reset it to factory defaults, then prevent the mesh from reconfiguring it in healing mode...  \" \n>Crash!< \n\"What's up with the network,\" our esteemed Director asks. \n\"We um, applied some changes to the wireless at his request,\" I say, nodding at the Boss. \n\"Undo them.\" \n\"We can't. He wanted them permanent. We'd have to power every last one of the access points down and factory reset them before we could reimage the mesh controller - or it'll see the old hardware address and reconfigure it again.\" \n\"How long will that take?\" \n\"Maybe two days to remove all the access points, a day to reset them all, an hour or so to reimage the controller.\" \n\"Can we buy some replacement units to get the network up again – call in a few favors?

It was a 1980s Granada after all.\" \n\"I don't see why we can't TRIAL something,\" the Boss wheedles. \"I'm sure they're USING them at NASA.\" \n\"And you feel we're comparable to NASA?\" I feel compelled to ask. \n\"They're surprisingly inexpensive,\" the Boss pivots. \"And they have so many features.\" \n\"Features like?\" I ask. \n\"You can program them from your phone.\" \n\"And... you see yourself individually programming a swarm of them from your phone?\" \n\"No, they can be integrated into other systems.\" \n\"Is one of those systems a woodchipper?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No, I mean our staff could program them.\" \n\"Yyyeeeess!!\" I gasp – at the possibilities for workplace mayhem. \"That would be great!\" \n\"We could flash the chip and probably write a plain-language interface!\" the PFY suggests. \n\"How do you mean?\" the Boss asks, no doubt sniffing a patent to steal. \n\"We give it a vocab of places, i.e. The IT office, Desk, Cupboard, etc. combined with people or groups of people, some action verbs and time contexts. You could say CLEAN UNDER DAVE'S DESK WHEN DAVE IS OUT or CLEAN THE IT OFFICE NEXT WEDNESDAY AT 4PM.\" \n\"But maybe other words too – like FIND, so you could FIND USB STICK UNDER MY DESK,\" I add. \n\"This sounds great!\" the Boss burbles happily. \nA trial is duly approved, and a bunch of robo-vacs bought... \nIt takes about three days for the abuse to begin. Top of the non-cleaning commands is \"TAKE THIS MONEY AND FIND ME A COFFEE AT THE CAFETERIA,\" which the cafe staff love as it's boosting sales and reducing legwork. \"TAKE THIS MONEY AND FIND ME A LAGER AT THE PUB ACROSS THE ROAD\" occasionally works, but there's a punishingly high attrition rate. \nOffice tensions are rising in most of the test subjects – mainly due to technicalities like whether Dave's socks count as rubbish, whether Dave himself counts as rubbish, and if the term WHETHER DAVE IS THERE OR NOT is a passive aggressive time context. \nThere are other problems, too, the most obvious of which is that people have started putting their stuff in places other than the floor. As a general rule it seems people are happier with Dave's socks being under the desk rather than on the desk... \nThe PFY agreed and has started fitting a QUICKLIME hopper to his vac's base station, so I realize I will have to act fast. \nThen one morning, the project is axed with no explanation. The Boss's only comment was that the Beancounters had found another cost center to make savings in. \nSigh. \n\"I'd only just taught my robo-vac to arrange my shoes in the corner,\" the Boss snivels. \n\"I know what you mean,\" I commiserate. \"I'd only just taught mine to FIND A FRESH DOG TURD OUTSIDE AND SMEAR IT UNDER THE HEAD BEANCOUNTERS DESK.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Well, it was all going to come to no good in the end anyway. The PFY had just fitted a quicklime hopper to the base station of his one – no idea what he was planning with that.\" \n\"So you ruined it for everyone.\" \n\"Not everyone. I also taught mine to HIDE FOR TWO WEEKS THEN REPEAT LAST INSTRUCTION – INDEFINITELY.\" \nWhat will they think of next? \n"}

However, I play along. \n\"Oh yes?\" \n\"Yes, it looks like you completed the project in June, but you associated some other costs against the same project last month.\" \n\"Yes, we bought some larger monitor mounts.\" \n\"But the project was for two large screen monitors for a couple of the meeting rooms.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"Mounts aren't monitors.\" \n\"But they're connected to the monitors,\" I point out. \n\"Yes, monitors are a computer expense, but the mounts come from the office furniture cost center.\" \n\"These aren't for an office.\" \n\"It's the same thing.\" \n\"Like your desk monitor and its base, you mean?\" \n\"No, that's not the same. The base comes with the monitor.\" \n\"So, if your monitor came without a cable, would a replacement cable be an electrical expense?\" the PFY asks. \n\"If it's supposed to come with a cable then it would be a computer expense.\" \n\"So you're thinking that a monitor isn't supposed to have a mount? Would you like us to lean it on the wall?\" \n\"It needs to come out of office expenses.\" \n\"OK, but what if we took the monitors off the boardroom wall and put those mounts on these screens. You could tell the Board that they'd have to get new mounts from their furniture budget.\" \n\"Though they'd more likely pay for it out of the Beancounter salary budget, what with that position that just became free,\" the PFY points out. \n\"You can't threaten me.\" \n\"I think we just did,\" the PFY says. \"Next thing you'll want to return the drone.\" \n\"Yes, that was the next thing. You paid for a drone out of your entertainment cost center.\" \n\"Well, sure, we use it to clean the camera lenses on the outside of the building – but some of the other stuff we see is pretty entertaining.\" \n\"YOU DON'T HAVE AN ENTERTAINMENT COST CENTER!\" \n\"Oh right, so … office furniture?\" \n\"IT'S NOT OFFICE FURNITURE!\" \n\"It sits on my desk.\" \n\"Not office furniture.\" \n\"What about if I put my monitor on it?\" \n… \nThe next morning there's a delegation from Beancounter Central. Apparently they want their dual monitor arms back. \n\"Look, I would LOVE to help you,\" I lie, \"but it turns out that over the years we've been buying these with the IT budget instead of the office furniture budget. So we took them all back. However, the good news is that we think we can just journal them over from your furniture budget to our IT budget. I'm guessing one of you can transfer all that money over?\" \n\"How about we have the arms back meantime?\" a Beancounter asks. \n\"Oh, again, we'd love to do that, but we just have to check that they're still safe – you know, metal fatigue and all that. My assistant is just testing one now.\" \n>SNAP< \n\"Oh dear,\" the PFY says, pulling a crowbar out of the broken innards of a monitor arm. \"That's the third one so far.\" \n\"How many have you … tested?\" one of the Beancounters asks. \n\"Three. Still plenty left to test, though. Unless …\" \n\"Unless what?\" \n\"I guess you could sign a form saying that you accept that your monitor arms may have deteriorated since they were first installed.\" \n\"OK, we'll do that.\" \n\"OK, I'll just print some forms – but wait – our printer has run out of toner cartridges. Are they an IT expense or an office furniture one? I mean, the printer does COME with toner cartridges, but they have a fraction of the toner of a new cartridge. Technically, installing a new cartridge would be an upgrade, and we've spent all our computer upgrade budget – and that has a hard budget limit, so we can't even ask you to extend it. However …\" \n\"However, what?\" \n\"We don't have an entertainment budget. But you could create one for us, and just put some toner cartridge money into it – say, enough money to buy two large screen monitor mounts?\" \n\"I … OK.\" \n\"But wait, technically we'd have to spend that money on entertainment.\" \n\"Maybe …\" \n\"No. I've got it!\" the PFY blurts. \"You could entertain Simon and me and then we'd feel so entertained that we'd buy the monitor mounts ourselves out of our own money. The entertainment money would be spent on entertainment, and the monitor mounts would be purchased, and it's possible that we'd find some toner cartridges somewhere so you could get your monitor arms back.\" \n\"I … guess that would work out OK.\" \n\"So we just need you to do that entertainment.\" \n\"What are you suggesting?\" one of the Beancounters asks warily. \n\"You guys ever seen Fight Club ?\" \n… \nHalf an hour of senseless Beancounter brutality later they've returned to their offices with their monitor arms. \n\"We still have to pay for those arms out of our own money,\" I point out to the PFY. \n\"Oh, I shouldn't worry about that.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"Well, I'm guessing they'll have a whip round once I tell them I had to order new mounting screws because of metal fatigue …\" \n\"Ooh – and while you're doing that I'll whip up and pinch all their toner cartridges. Looks like we're going to be well under our budget this year!\" \n"}

The chance for misinterpreting signal states escalates as the states increase. Did you read Stephen Hawking's book on the bit state of the Cosmos and the anterior projection of digitized sine waves?\" \n\"Uh, no,\" the Boss admits. \nFor the Boss to have read any such book it would have to be printed on gloss paper and have lots of pictures in it. \n\"Hawkings wrote that the complementary bit-state between binary and some other order of signal level needs a minimum bit-state coherence of 30 percent.\" \nI can sense a stirring in the Force as a gentle waft of mild confusion emanates from the Boss. \n\"It's basically the saturation point of signal discretion over the event horizon,\" the PFY continues. \nALMOST THERE … \n\"It's why the coplanar chip-density level has reached its signalling limits.\" \nJUST ABOUT … \n\"And we think we've cracked it by modifying the codificaton of signal with a gamma array feedback loop.\" \n>DUMMY MODE ON!< \n\"Uh huh,\" the Boss nods numbly. \nIt's a bit like witnessing a drowning. There's a bit of a struggle, a more frantic struggle, then finally, relaxation. \nThe Boss is in a better place. \n\"And what does it mean?\" \n\"It means we're on the cusp of a new generation of computing.\" \n\"It does?\" \n\"Sure. You know Gates, Jobs, Wozniak?\" \n\"Uh yes.\" \n\"Hacks. Banging around with binary systems that'd become obsolete the moment the trinary system was born.\" \n\"And you're saying you discovered it?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\" Here ?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"In an IT office with no labs, no electron microscope or any of that other stuff needed for proper research?\" \n\"The composting toilet was invented in someone's backyard,\" the PFY interjects helpfully. \n\"And those computing hacks often worked out of their sheds and front rooms,\" I add. \n\"And you expect me to believe you?\" \n\"It's all right there,\" the PFY says, gesturing at a small circuit board on his desk. \n\"Is that it?\" \n\"Of course not!\" the PFY scoffs. \"That's the main bus routing module. There's no way we'd keep the pieces all in one place if we weren't actively testing it.

At the company. In company time.\" \n\"It wasn't all company time,\" the PFY counters. \"I did quite a lot of the initial work at home. I mean you could maybe try to patent the board, but all the intellectual property was developed at home – or on the way to work.\" \n\"Still, the company should be receiving their share of any patentable product.\" \n\"The company's done nothing, just provided an office for me to do my other work in, and a table to rest my bus routing module on.\" \n\"I'm not sure the legal team would see it that way,\" the Boss replies, with a little hint of a threat. \n\"The moment you get the legal team in, we're done for!\" I blurt. \"They're leakier than a toddler's nappy during trampoline hour. The moment they get the detail, it'll get patented somewhere else and we'll lose everything!\" \n\"So why haven't you patented it yourself?\" \n\"Just waiting till payday,\" I reply. \"The PFY and I are both a bit light this month due to crippling tax bills.

In other words, they're keeping the money for themselves as a thank you for steering the company through the post-COVID years, after banking record revenues through the pandemic. \nOrdinarily this sort of news is only reported at the company Christmas party – however, the board decided to soften the blow by telling us early. And cancelling the Christmas Party – to cut costs … which will no doubt result in a fractionally higher bonus. \nAH, GOOD TIMES! \nThe PFY is not impressed, as the company's done remarkably well in the last few years so he'd assumed bonuses would be back on the cards. \nThe Boss is similarly gloomy. \nI, on the other hand, am more pragmatic. If the money's there to be taken, the board will take it. \nThe PFY has a mathematical approach to this disappointment: fewer board members would result in a surplus of cash, which would then be available for bonuses. \n\"Ah, your carefree optimism!\" I cry. \"At the board level, this would just mean an increase in bonus for the remaining members.\" \n\"You're taking this rather well,\" the Boss opines. \n\"Yes, I think it was George Santayana who said 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to spend hours in a fake escape room in the basement with only a pencil, a bucket of partially drinkable water and a single sheet of toilet paper'.\" \n\"But … no toilet?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Well there's that bucket.\" \n\"What, you're serious?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Oh yes. They went in 40 minutes ago.\" \n\"They wouldn't be stupid enough to do that.\" \n\"Sure they would – they got an email telling them that the bonus was being paid in cash to get around tiresome VAT rules and that we made it a 'competition' so they could declare it as winnings from a game of skill – if they declared it at all. They couldn't get here quick enough!\" \n\"So you're holding them prisoner?\" \n\"I'm not sure they're aware of that yet. One of them isolated the sprinkler supply to the building because he thought it was a key to opening the door.\" \n\"And what are they doing now?\" \n\"I don't know, I turned the lights off about ten minutes ago and they've been using their phone LEDs for lighting. And apparently the mobile coverage in the plant room is appalling.\" \n\"Turn the lights on will you?\" the Boss asks. \n… \n\"Hello?\" one of the crustier board members pleads into the void. \n\"Hello,\" I reply. \"How are you doing?\" \n\"We seem to be having problems finding the first … uh … clue.\" \n\"Ah yes!\" I respond \"The first clue. And you're sure you've looked?\" \n\"Yes. I think perhaps this game is not really for us.\" \n\"I understand. You realize, however, that the form you signed earlier says you forfeit your bonus if you fail to win the game of skill?\" \n\"Ah. Are there any hints you can give us?\" \n\"Of course there are, and I'm only too pleased to help!\" \n\"How many clues are there?\" \n\"How many living people are in the room?\" \n\"What?! Uhm, seven.\" \n\"Not eight?\" \n\"No, Sir Nigel passed away last night.\" \n\"That's terrible news. No doubt you've cast lots for his bonus?\" \n\"Pardon?\" \n\"Nothing, just a semi-seasonal reference. So, as noted on the form you are each entitled to one clue.\" \n\"OK, can I have my clue?\" \n\"Sure. You'll notice that the red fire evacuation notice to your left is held to the wall with a single screw, allowing you to swing the sign to one side.\" \nFrom my display, the PFY, Boss and I listen to the discussion several floors below. \n\"It's a credit card reader! Is there anything written on it? Does it have a serial number that's a code of some sort? What happens if you push the buttons?\" \n… \n\"I think we'll need another clue,\" the board member groans, about five minutes of prodding and discussion later. \n\"But you haven't activated your first clue!\" I blurt. \n\"How do we activate the first clue?\" \n\"I'm so glad you asked. You see in front of you a credit card reader …\" \n\"What, we have to pay?\" he snaps back, offended. \n\"Not at all. I can assure you that you will exit this room in six hours whether you pay or not.\" \n\"Well we'll do that then.\" \n\"I can also assure you that the huge lump in the middle of the floor – known in the trade as a scour valve – will open 12 times in that period.\" \n\"What's a scour valve?\" \n\"I'll give you a free clue. There's a really large sewer pipe connected to it, with the pressurized waste from the building passing through it.\" \n\"So we have to pay?\" \n\"Yes, but I can assure you that you will be pleased you paid for this hint.\" \n\"How much is it?\" \n\"The number will appear on the screen.\" \n\"A hundred and eighty pounds,\" he gasps. \n\"It'll be worth it!\" I say. \n*kaching* \n\"Alright, what's my clue?\" \n\"Your clue is a three-parter. (1) You've just paid for one item for the company Christmas Party; (2) The items get more expensive with each clue; and (3) Your credit card was disabled after the transaction and cannot be reused for another transaction.\" \nI let that sink in for a moment. \n\"Can I buy a clue?\" one of the sharper member asks. \n\"Indeed you can!\" \n\"Two hundred and forty five pounds!\" \n\"That'll be the champagne.\" \n*kaching* \n\"I'll buy a clue!\" another member says, seeing where this is going. \n… \n\"Three hundred and seventeen pounds.\" \n\"And that's the lagers,\" I comment. \n… three transactions later … \n\"Two thousand, six hundred and eighty pounds!\" \n\"The catering. I did warn you the items were increasingly expensive.\" \n\"I'm not paying! I don't care if you open that valve thing!\" \n\"BONUS CLUES TIME!\" I burble. \"These are for everyone. Clue 1. As I noted earlier, the number of clues required is linked to the number of people alive in the room; Clue 2. Your Christmas Bonuses are, no doubt, only given to board members who are alive; and Clue 3. There are several bricks laying in the corner of the room.\" \n\"I'LL PAY!\" our recalcitrant board member cries, microseconds later. \n*kaching* \n\"CONGRATULATIONS!\" I gasp happily. \"You have successfully negotiated your way out of the escape room.\" \n\"The door's still closed.\" \n\"Well yes, like I told you, the door will open in six hours. The Christmas Party starts four hours from now.\" \n\"But you've sorted out the scour valve thingy?\" \n\"Why would you think that?\" \n\"But we paid!\" \n\"Oh yes. For the party. But perhaps we should talk about staff bonuses.\" \n\"That's non-negotiable.\" \n\"No problems. I'm just going to vent the scour valve – just to clear any trapped gas. You can use that time to think about that bonus situation …\" \n"}

We launch an independent inquiry about the party.\" \n\"An independent inquiry?\" \n\"Yeah, we'll get the PFY to do it.\" \n\"He's not independent!\" \n\"Course he is. He didn't send the party email out.\" \n\"No, you did,\" the Boss says. \n\"Actually, you did. You emailed from your own desktop.

He'll never actually nail one person to the cross of responsibility, but he will find some serious flaws in the company's culture, which the company will agree to address immediately. I'll be given a whistleblower's bonus for highlighting this looming potential human safety crisis, and the company will move on.\" \n\"No,\" the Boss shakes his head. \"No one will go for that!\" \n\"Of course they will – because the only other option would be to name names. This way, I can admit I should have realized the seriousness of the situation, and possibly heeded the advice of security professionals – especially when someone threw that inkjet printer out the window …\" \n\"HE threw the inkjet printer out the window,\" the Boss interrupts, \"and it barely missed me.\" \n\"But I did my level best to stop things getting out of hand,\" I continue. \"I will freely admit that some of my decisions were creatively useless. But let's not forget: no one got hurt.\" \n\"And it would be different if someone got hurt?\" \n\"Depending on the person, yes. You've got to understand the optics of this. Here, we're a company coming back from 'near tragedy' and implementing some very inexpensive workplace operating procedures for the benefit and safety of all. Think about it: if you give the procedures a fancy name and start expounding the virtues of them to other companies as a plan of increasing workplace safety throughout the country – well, you could probably get a K out of it in five or so years.\" \n\"It'll never fly – and I'll not support you getting a bonus.\" \n\"So instead you'd opt for a trial by media. Who do you think would win that one? You, with your annual subscription to Trainlovers Monthly , or the PFY, with his cornucopia of carefully cultured hard-drinking media contacts?\" \n\"I …\" \n\"That's right – not you.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"So I think it's best for everyone if we just let this party inquiry get under way …\" \n\"I suppose …\" \nAnyway, we can't stop – it's 1030 and we have to open the bar. \n\"What?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Well, there's still quite a bit of alcohol left over from yesterday,\" I explain. \n\"And it would be irresponsible of us to just leave it laying around for someone with poor impulse control to find,\" the PFY adds. \n\"You can't!\" \n\"You did.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"The email you sent out about 15 minutes ago with the subject ROUND TWO.\" \n\"I …\" \n\"Oh, and we left an extinguisher in your office after that comment in your email about how flammable your bookshelf probably is – and that Forest Fenn used to work in your office.

Obviously we can't just change the Corporate font to Aptos as a way of disguising the fact that we're not adding any real value, but there's plenty of other stuff we can do to 'improve our service level' without actually doing anything.\" \n\"Things like what?\" \n\"Let's take the air conditioning system for a start.\" \n\"We don't run the air conditioning system,\" the Boss blurts. \n\"We don't, but we do provide the service of scheduling when areas get switched on.\" \n\"Not to mention the service of setting what temperature and mode is selected,\" the PFY adds. \n\"And whether or not the AC remote control is locked out,\" I continue. \"Now those services don't come cheap. To the casual observer it might look like we only go into the HVAC management system once every month or so to make sure nothing's caught fire, but these days it's a far more complex system now that we're using ... uh ... let's say AI to ... predict usage trends and ... uh ... ensure optimum comfort.\" \n\"And who can forget those times when people'd get to work on a freezing morning only to find their AC locked in cooling mode?\" the PFY says. \n\"When was that?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Every morning next week,\" I reply. \n\"Is that before or after the security alarms keep going off because there's no 'AI' to work out whether they should be armed or not?\" the PFY hints. \n\"Where are you going with this?\" the Boss asks. \n\"We need to move to a subscription model for all these AI services.\" \n\"We don't have any AI services.\" \n\"Of course we do – and they're costly. What, with the licensing fees, the integration pathway ...\" \n\"Depreciation,\" the PFY chips in. \n\"Yes, thank you, depreciation ... uh ... window tax ...\" \n\"Window tax?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Of course. Everyone knows that windows affect air conditioning. Then there's uh ...\" \n\"Stamp duty?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"That's possibly a bridge too far,\" the Boss says. \n\"Yes, but then we have all the AI modules we'll need to license.\" \n\"What modules?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Heating, that'll be a module. Then there's cooling. Uh, fan-only.\" \n\"ON and OFF,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Oh yes, ON and OFF – and they're the expensive modules.\" \n\"I don't think anyone's going to pay for those modules. After all, we already bought the air con system.\" \n\"You need to look at this through the software lens. How many times did we buy the latest version of Office? Endless upgrades, all worthless now because we lease a product.\" \n\"People will just say we should go back to the old version.\" \n\"We'd love to go back to the old version, except that the software is only back-supported for two major releases, and they just released three major releases over the weekend.\" \n\"The users will want you to recover the management computer to the old version.\" \n\"Again, love to, but unfortunately the online license validation system is no longer responding – because it's not supported, being three major revisions old now.\" \n\"I see. And you think that'll bring in enough ... income.\" \n\"Oh no, but once we put AI into the stairwell lighting and the automatic door speed control – because of all those nasty accidents – I think people will come around.\" \n\"So we're just going to extort money without actually doing anything for it?\" \n\"Welcome to the new age of IT.\" \n"}

You know that kid in the coloured pencil office who always says 'to be pacific' - we probably want that as a private language model for him alone and not for everyone else's communications. And say if the Head of H.R. had recently sent about 100 emails back and forth to his minions about how they're going to crack down on the malingerers that are working from home for health reasons – you possibly wouldn't want that coming up as a suggested sentence for one of the aforementioned malingerers when they wanted to apply for sick leave...\" \n\"Err...\" \n\"Do you happen to have a copy of a contract?\" I ask. \n\"Ahm, well. It was more of a boilerplate thing,\" the Boss backpedals. \"We have a no-cost trial of the software, then, if there were no major complaints, we subscribe to the service.\" \n\"Ah yes, the try-before-you-get-addicted strategy – as used by Class-A drug pushers everywhere. Nice.\" \n\"I... what?\" \n\"You know, it's free till you're hooked – then the gouging begins.\" \n\"No...\" \n\"So, you have the pricing model?\" \n\"I was told it was very reasonable.\" \n\"Sounds legit!\" the PFY says. \n\"And what budget were you using?\" \n\"Our new AI budget.\" \n\"What new AI budget?\" \n\"Oh, didn't I tell you about that?  We consolidated all the unused cost centers into a central AI budget.\" \nAnd by \"unused cost centers\" the Boss means the private slush funds of the PFY and myself. I suspect our deliveries of \"cleaning alcohol\" may be coming to an end. \n\"Yes, but as you say, if there were major complaints...\" \n\"I can't see how that would happen. The AI builds models of common usage and blends it into your correspondence. You know that email I sent you this morning about the security system not permitting me to access the server room?\" \n\"The three-page monologue on access control criteria, your position in the Company, your seniority level, how this might be construed as a disciplinary matter, etc?\" \n\"Yes, that's the one. That was completely AI, based on my previous conversations with you, H.R. and our Health and Safety person. I just typed the phrase 'Justify access to the server room in a request' and it created that email.\" \nAnd it was a reasonable email. I mean, it was dull and unnecessarily verbose – but far more coherent than the Boss's normal stream of consciousness. \n\"Yes, but there still might be complaints,\" the PFY suggests, wanting to keep that \"cleaning alcohol.\" \n\"Oh, I doubt it.\" \n...The next day... \n\"Well there have been a couple of complaints,\" the Boss admits, in response to my question. \n\"Really?\" I ask. \"Was it because email messages started calling the recipient bumhole?\" \n\"I... how did you know that?\" \n\"I didn't – but I did know the PFY automated the sending of 500,000 email interchanges last night with that particular foible. The emails may also have had far right views, misattributed many common quotes to Chairman Mao and favorably reviewed various investment schemes made with Nigerian princes who contacted complete strangers over email.\" \n\"I think people will understand that these quirks are just a foible of AI that can be trained out,\" the Boss replies. \n\"Those same people you bulk-emailed the AI contract to? Highlighting the clause permitting them to scan person messages?\" \n\"I didn't... Oh,\" the Boss sighs. \n\"Yes. Still, half of those bumholes probably haven't opened their email yet.\" \n\"So there's still time to...\" the boss says, grasping at featherlike straws. \n\"No... No. The bumholes at H.R. probably didn't like your 'Justify me a pay rise for not being an inbred ferret's backside like those H.R. people' email.\" \n\"Oooh, and here comes one of those bumholes from security that your email thought was borderline neanderthal...\" \nThe rest as Chairman Mao would say, is cleaning alcohol history... \n"}

As we're not having any issues, there's an undercurrent of betrayal in his words. \n\"I like to keep an open mind,\" the Boss says in response to my sigh of doubt – once more confusing the words \"open\" and \"empty.\" \n... \nAn hour and a half later he's in Mission Control, bursting to tell us about what he's seen and heard. \n\"They've got this amazing piece of software which ...\" he starts. \n\"... make everyone's life (a) easier, (b) safer, (c) clearer, or (d) better ordered?\" I suggest \n\"No, it's all of those things but more.

That's the point!\" \n\"And who will look at those metrics?\" \n\"The Company will!\" \n\"So when you say 'The Company' you mean no one?\" \n\"No. Everyone will.\" \n\"No they won't!\" . \n\"They will! You can glean great insights from looking at ...\" \n\"... your poo,\" the PFY interrupts. \"It can tell you how well your body is processing food, whether you have a serious illness, AND it will reflect the state of your microbiome. But no one really does it. And that's when it's directly related to their own, personal, and highly important health!\" \n\"That's different,\" the Boss says. \n\"No it's not. It's like when people say 'The Staff' will empty the dishwasher, yet every morning the dishwasher is full of dirty dishes.  Unless it's someone's job it doesn't get done. And it's even worse when the job has absolutely no relevance. People will not poo-gaze at metrics.\" \n\"Yes, but we can use these metrics to do our work better. WE COULD SAVE MONEY!\" the Boss says, exuding the sort of fervor you generally only see behind the drinks table of the People's Temple. \n\"By finding ways to reduce manpower and cut jobs, you mean?\" I ask, looking out his office window at the unsuspecting staff. \"I bet that'll be popular.\" \n\"We're just looking at the software at the moment. There's been no decisions.\" \n... Three days later ... \n\"... and we've identified some areas of potential savings,\" the Boss tells the assembled IT masses. \"Our contractors have highlighted several areas where we can reduce overheads, and as a result the Company spend.\" \n\"Do you mean job cuts?\" our Business Analysts asks, doing a bit of on-the-fly BA work. \n\"We're thinking more Strategic Realignment of Company Resources,\" the Boss sidesteps, avoiding an acronym but still admitting nothing – and everything. \n\"So job cuts then?\" the BA repeats, annoyed. \n\"We have no definite plans to reduce staffing levels,\" the Boss lies, feeling the tide turn against him as he crumples the \"Sacrifices must be made\" page of his \"staff consultation\" notes. For a moment there I thought he was going to slap on the pointy ears and start talking about the needs of the many ... \nThe damage is done, though, and the mood of the room turns as the staff can smell blood in the water. \n\"We'll need to carefully consider our options before making any decisions,\" he adds as the room silently starts emptying. \n... \n\"How do you think it went?\" he asks us a few minutes later. \n\"On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say you're as popular as Clippy, Microsoft's Office Assistant.\" \n\"Oh, do they have an Office Assistant?\" \n\"Not any more,\" I counter. \n\"It was probably just a strategic realignment of Microsoft's Company resources,\" the PFY suggests. \"And not because everyone absolutely hated condescending suggestions.\" \n\"But we have to make savings!\" \n\"Do we?\" I ask. \"The Company is ridiculously top-heavy, and a couple of board members would probably achieve the savings you're looking for.\" \n\"And you think I can convince a couple of them to quit?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I was thinking more of murder suicide,\" I reply. \n\"Or something that looked like murder suicide,\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Uh ... I don't think that will be necessary,\" the Boss backpedals. \n\"Suit yourself, but it'd improve morale after your latest speech.\" \n\"I don't think it was that bad.\" \n\"You've just told people in an airy-fairy way that you're 'considering options' in response to a question about job cuts. I'd confidently bet you 50 quid that half the department is currently engaged in CV polishing.\" \n\"I doubt that ...\" \n... The next morning ... \n\"Ah. We've had a resignation,\" the Boss says, eyeing a handwritten note violently stapled to his door. \n\"What's it written in – finger paint?\" the PFY asks. \n\"No, no,\" I say. \"If my guess is correct, I think our former BA is not only resigning, but also inviting the Boss to investigate the state of his microbiome.\" \n\"Still, nice flourish in the signature, though,\" the PFY adds. \n"}

We won't attend any conference etc. that it is being given by an 'industry expert,' a 'guru' of any description, or a 'key player' in any field. We won't go to anything on AI where a presenter has '20 years of experience' – because 20 years ago 'AI' was a vacuum cleaner with a 'bag-full' light.\" \n\"Yes, but this isn't ...\" \n\"We won't attend a conference which involves a two-hour drive trapped in a vehicle with a work colleague whose pastimes involve trains, plants or line\/Morris dancing, or whose conversation is limited to how undervalued they are, what illnesses they have, or how good they are at any particular activity. OR how great their children are at any particular activity – or line\/Morris dancing etc.\" \n\"Yes, but ...\" \n\"If there's not hot, meat-based food at the event, we won't be going; nor will we attend if we feel the 'networking' to hot meat-based food ratio is too high. We will, of course, expect alcoholic beverages as a social anesthetic and vendor merchandise worth at least twice as much as the petrol we expended getting there – the cost of which I will also be claiming.\" \n\"I'm not sure ...\" \n\"In addition, we won't add our names to any mailing lists, join any interest group, committee, steering group or working party. We won't pose for publicity photos, enter business cards into any draw where the odds of winning are less than 65 percent – and we reserve the right to put 50 business cards in (with invalid contact information) to improve those odds.\" \n\"I ...\" \n\"Our attendance must not be taken to be an approval or validation of the event or any of its underlying assumptions – and should be viewed in the same light as our attendance at, say, a rubbish tip.\" \n\"Yes, but this is mostly a party!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"In that case I refer you to the decision tree for attending social events. You will note the alcohol to 'networking' ratio is substantially higher, and that we'll need a door-to-door shuttle service which must include the driver aiding us to insert our house keys into our respective door locks. We can usually take it from there.\" \n\"It's a low-key affair,\" the Boss counters. \n\"The ninja clauses will still apply.\" \n\"Ninja clauses?\" \n\"Yes, we reserve the right to: duck behind large objects when salespeople are looking for someone to talk to; pretend to be remotely solving a critical system outage over the phone; and, if all else fails, pretend to be choking or having a cardiac incident.\" \n\"It's just a party,\" the Boss says. \n... A day later, at the party ... \n\"Stage 5 Klingon, 12 meters, 3 o'clock,\" the PFY murmurs. \n\"What?\" the Boss asks, as the PFY and I simultaneously hold our phones up to our ears and stride off quickly in different directions using terms like \"Immediate Boundary Router Isolation\" and \"Critical Attack Vector Insertion.\" Separated from the herd, the Boss is easily picked off by the guy wanting to sell him some cloud-integrated services – though sadly the PFY \"accidentally\" caught the Boss's index finger in the car door earlier – so he won't be signing anything tonight. \nThe guy exudes a strange aroma of frenetic technical fervor, and looks to be salivating over the enhanced properties of their cloud offering. Too late, the Boss attempts to edge away slowly but his sales guy just takes up the slack, so it looks like a slow motion pawn-king endgame. \nWhen he sees the inevitable checkmate, the Boss starts looking for a victim to castle with. I duck behind a large sign board and look around for the PFY, but he's gone. A large potted plant in the far corner of the conference center appears to have gained mass, though. \n\"Well, I think I should probably bring my technical people in on this,\" the Boss says, making a beeline for the potted plant, while I dash back to the bar. \n\"This is Stephen, one of our technical guys ...\" I hear the Boss saying, from a distance. \nThere's not a lot of time, so I slip the barman a 20 quid note. \n\"I ...  My ...\" the PFY says, clutching his chest, dropping to a kneeling position. \n\"GIVE THIS MAN SOME AIR!\" I say, striding over – but the Klingon is still orbiting. \n\"What did you say to him?!\" I ask him. \n\"I ... Nothing,\" the Klingon says, backing away into the shadows, knowing full well that potential personal liability checkmates sales commissions. \n\"Get the AED!\" I urge him, pointing at a large plastic box with a heart on it that I recently placed on the bar ... \nFifteen minutes later the PFY and I are enjoying a couple of chilled bottles of lager from the \"AED\" in the peace and quiet of the conference center's medical room, waiting for an ambulance that was never called.   Through a gap in the frosted glass I can see the Klingon has spotted the Boss again. \nPAWN TO QUEEN'S IDIOT 4! \n"}

A quick check reveals that his second in command also has a locked top drawer. This is rather unusual as several years ago the PFY and I snapped keys off in their locks to prevent this happening. It's unlikely they had the keys removed as we had the foresight to smear the keys in epoxy resin before inserting them... \nHmm. \nI nip back up to my office to get my selection of thin pieces of spring steel and unlock the desks concerned. \nAt first glance there's not a lot to interest me. In the Head Beancounter's drawer I can see the evidence of a recent lock installation, a notebook with various passwords in it (which I obviously take note of), and an assortment of low value cash. His assistant's desk is similarly uninteresting. To spice up their lives I swap the two drawers around and relock them. \n... \nThe next morning almost dawns as I pop back into Beancounter Central to see what has transpired. I pause in the doorway to scan the semi-darkness for the telltale signs of infrared from hastily installed cameras, but there's nothing. \nThe two locked desks are so interesting that I almost forget to swap the '.' and ',' keys on everyone's keyboards. The drawers themselves show the telltale signs of an idiot's attempts to open them, AND have had the locks replaced. Instead of the entry level pressed steel wafer lock we have more upmarket pin tumbler locks. Interesting. I pop back down to Mission Control, return and open the desks (still nothing interesting), swap the drawers, and then slip a slightly thicker piece of spring steel into the lock. Finally, I give it a hearty whack in order to deform the last pin in the lock and make it unopenable. \n... \nThe next pre-pre-dawn I pop back up again. One camera, pointing at the doorway and one laptop, \"casually\" left open on a desk, pointing at the Head Beancounter's office. I pop the ceiling tile in the corridor, lift the one next to it and knock the webcam into the bin. I slip into the office, gently turn the laptop to face the bin and throw office items into the bin until I'm sure the webcam is trashed. I then gently close the laptop screen. \nI swap all the wireless mouse batteries for the flat ones that I brought with me. \nThe desks have newer locks of a far higher quality than the two previous versions. Still nothing of interest though. SWAP LOCK. WHACK! \n... \nThe next predawn I start my venture with a borescope over the ceiling from the adjoining offices. Three cameras, two laptops and an additional PIR sensor. Knowing I was going to need the extra time I came prepared... From the ceiling space I direct the window cleaning pole towards the nearest camera, pulling the string attached to the spray paint can taped to the end. Two cameras down. \nThe third camera is pointing at the chief's office so I'll be able to deal with that one from inside the office - only someone's changed the door key - which would matter if the door wasn't so poorly installed that the anti shim pin wasn't engaged. I let myself in, spray the final camera and then turn one laptop to face the other before dropping an ancient cast iron tape dispenser onto it from a great height off camera. I drop the tape dispenser a second time, then gently close both ruined laptops. I crawl behind desks past the new PIR in order to swap the keyboard\/mouse dongles of all the Beancounter machines, then inspect the drawers. \nNOW we're talking! \nThe new locks are beyond my lockpicking skills. They are top-of-the-line stuff. I'm sure I could get there - eventually - but who has the time? With a block of wood and a hammer I remove the top of the desks (still nothing interesting), SWAP, WHACK. \n... \n\"It's some sort of campaign!\" the Head Beancounter cries. \n\"And you don't know anything about this?\" the HR chief asks the Boss and me suspiciously. \n\"I mean I could try to look back through the building security camera logs if it would help?\" I suggest. \nI look around at the rest of the people in the HR chief's office and realize that everyone in the room knows who the culprit is, and yet... \n\"Security has reviewed the tapes,\" the HR chief says. \"Some have been moved to point at walls, some have been obscured, and some have been tampered with. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?\" \nIn the end, not much more is said and the meeting is over, which is great as I need to get back to work. Doing the PFY's work as well as my own has really put the pressure on. That said, he'll be back in a week so things will be back to normal soon enough. \nI almost wish I hadn't just seen the HR chief lock his top drawer... \n"}

The place has more technology in it than a top-end conference center, and it would have been cheaper to have each of the board members fitted with some futuristic videoconferencing brain implant. \n\"Oh yeah, it's not working at the moment so we thought we'd just use one of the meeting rooms,\" my user admits. \nAnd now I'm at a crossroads. Should I give up an entire morning to show someone how to use the completely working boardroom, with all its advanced features, again, or should I just get the crappy old wall screen going again? \n\"Fine, so what you're going to need are several magnifying glasses,\" I say. \n... \n\"We need to do something about our boardroom technology,\" the Boss says, less than an hour later. \n\"No we don't.\" \n\"We do. We need to upgrade it to the latest technology.\" \n\"So we want an AI-powered screen?\" \n\"No, I don't thi-\" \n\"8K resolution?\" \n\"Well, if that's what they have these days.\" \n\"Some screens do, not many laptops, though.\" \n\"Well, maybe we don't nee-\" \n\"What about if we fitted all the board members with a futuristic videoconferencing brain implant?\" \n\"What, is there such a thing?\" \n\"No, but we could substitute a detonator cap with an inductive charging coil.\" \n\"And that would solve the problem?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The next time they bent down to look at their wireless charger – yes.\" \n\"And this is the latest in video technology?\" \n\"Not even remotely. But it would solve a problem.\" \n\"No, I think we need technical,\" the Boss demurs. \n\"Should it have a low carbon footprint?\" \n\"Yes, definitely.\" \n\"So that'll be three months delivery time. In a solar-powered ship – which doesn't exist. But three months after it does exist we could have it. Or we could get it delivered by a solar-powered plane, which doesn't exist either, but doesn't exist even more than the ship. But it'll have a much shorter delivery time. Probably.\" \n\"What?\" the Boss asks, adrift on an ocean of confusion. Possibly the same ocean that the solar ship will eventually cross. \n\"Should the screen be able to do video conferencing?\" I continue. \n\"Oh yes!\" \n\"At what resolution?\" \n\"I ... what are my options?\" \n\"640 x 480, 1280 x 1024, 4K, 8K, or Future K?\" \n\"What's Future K?\" \n\"That's a resolution that hasn't been invented yet.\" \n\"What's the point of that?\" \n\"About the same point as 8K – but on the plus side the screen will likely be delivered by solar plane – so there's no hurry on that decision.\" \n\"Can't we just ...\" \n\"LCD, LED, QLED, QNED, OLED, or QD-OLED?\" I ask. \n\"I ... uh ...\" \n\"OK, skip that, how dumb do you want it to be?\" \n\"Not dumb at all! It needs to be smart! It should be able to meet all users' needs.\" \n\"Yeah, that's not going to happen. Our people can't even work an HDMI socket when it's built into a table, so there's no chance they'll manage higher technical interfaces.\" \n\"I think you underestimate our peoples' intelligence.\" \n\"Impossible. My estimations can't go that low.\" \n\"So what are you suggesting?\" \n\"I was going to propose a group policy hack to reduce maximum desktop screen resolution to 1600 x 1200 (which no one will notice) and then disable wireless screen sharing.\" \n\"We can't do that!\" \n\"In that case there's really only one option for the boardroom.\" \nWhich is?' \n\"It's quite high tech.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"We just get the board to all meet in the same room.\" \n\"Yes,\" the Boss says. \"Yes, that would work, wouldn't it?\" \n\"And then fit them with those detonator caps.\" \n"}

A new Boss from a candidate pool of one. Aiman. \nOne applicant never showed, one called this morning to say she had a better job elsewhere, and the third of the four possibles wanted to negotiate his package by doubling his salary and leave entitlement – before the interview began. \nSo we're down to one. \n\"Can you tell me about your experience with AI?\" the HR droid says. \n\"Could you perhaps expand the question a little?\" Aiman asks. \"It's a fairly broad topic.\" \n\"Well, I mean your history. With AI?\" \n\"Well, as I said that field is broad, and I'm certainly no expert. I guess I have a working knowledge of it – however, when it comes to matters of complexity I'd be looking to my team for guidance.\" \n\"I see. What about your leadership style? How would you describe yourself?\" \n\"Hmm. I see myself more of a lead-by-example person. I like to empower my team whilst also keeping abreast of any developments where they may need a guiding hand.\" \n\"Yes. OK. Uhhm, over to you, Ed?\" \nEd, a mid-level beancounter, asks a set of questions that only he knows the proper answers to, and Aiman asks for question expansions and again suggests they're fairly broad topics... No one but me seems to notice as most people tend to go into power save mode when a mid-level beancounter starts talking. \n\"Simon?\" the HR bloke says, waking me from Hibernate. \n\"Yes?\" \n\"Your questions?\" \n\"Sure. Where would you store your passwords – on a piece of paper under your keyboard or in a phone password app?\" \n\"Under the keyboard,\" Aiman responds. \n\"What?\" the mid-level beancounter says. \n\"Apps can be hacked, but under the keyboard requires physical access,\" he replies. \n\"Fair enough,\" I reply. \"Now, if you could be any battery, which would you be and why?\" \n\"I hardly think that's relevant,\" the HR droid says. \n\"No, no, it's fine,\" our candidate chips back. \"An AA battery – because it's a standard.\" \n\"IS THE RIGHT ANSWER!\" I blurt. \nTen minutes of further question expansions, broad topic identification, and short sentence answers later, we thank our candidate for his attendance and tell him we'll let him know by the end of the day. \n... \n\"What was that battery stuff about?\" the HR guy asks. \n\"Nothing,\" I respond. \"Because it was irrelevant.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"We're going to give him the job,\" I counter. \n\"Not necessarily,\" the HR bloke says. \n\"So, we're going to re-advertise?\" I ask. \n\"Oh no, we have a limited appointments budget.\" \n\"So I should spin my pen anticlockwise ten times?\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because magical thinking is the only move left?\" \n... \nSo Aiman starts the next day – well, sort of starts. His HR-negotiated work-from-home package pretty much means he only has to be on site for the apocalypse, a zombie plague, or Ragnarök – though only if it's on a weekday between 10 and 2. \nHis first day consists of emailed questions about our strategy, equipment replacement policy, staff culture, and our disaster recovery plan. \nDay two, he asks for a breakdown of our Health and Safety Policy, our electrical testing regime, and records of all switchboard thermal imaging we've done. \nBy day three, people up and down the food chain are already getting a bit tired of Aiman – but to his credit he's made some interesting discoveries, like how we don't have a Health and Safety Policy, an electrical testing regime, or switchboard thermal imaging. \nOn day four, the PFY has resorted to social media to dig up some kompromat on Aiman. \n\"Nothing,\" the PFY says. \"It's like he doesn't exist.\" \n\"Well, to be fair, he doesn't exist,\" I admit. \n\"What?\" \n\"I applied for the Boss's role with four great-looking candidates,\" I say. \"I pulled three out at the last minute, leaving a ring-in to attend an interview with two pieces of advice: 1. Ask for a broader explanation to any question you don't understand, then suggest it's a broad topic. 2. Always answer as a 'team player.'\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"I want to test my Boss AI package.\" \n\"Yeah, you've done that befor... \" \n\"That was an experiment with our department. THIS one's an experiment with HR.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Mainly because Aiman's drawing a salary, but also to probe the limitations of our HR department.\" \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"Oh, let's not spoil the surprise.\" \nThe next day Aiman's email is in Esperanto. Passing it through a translation engine, he's advocating us taking up Esperanto as a workplace communication system because it's the most widely spoken language, and also because learning a language has been shown to help with lifetime learning. \n\"Would it be safe to assume that Aiman has come off his medication?\" the PFY asks, having received an email (in Esperanto) about using the heat rejection component of the server room aircon to create a hot yoga meeting room. \n\"Coming off his medication. He has yet to ask for a food allowance for his virtual support animal and has not yet suggested that we should solve technical disagreements with a dance-off – but he will.\" \n\"Wh...\" \n\"Aiman's technically unfireable. He doesn't have to come in and has no real responsibilities outside of KPIs – which he's meeting.\" \n\"Bu...\" \n\"That said, I think the 'bring someone else's child into work' day will probably be the beginning of the end for him, and he'll get a settlement offer long before he purchases chairs for everyone with a stand-up desk...\" \n\"BUT WHY?\" the PFY snaps. \n\"Well, it passes the time.\" \n"}

In his first five microseconds he'd created about 100 Teams chats in order to \"get his feet under the desk.\" With an annoying attitude like that, it won't be long before his whole body ends up down there with them. \nHis whizzy new stand-up, sit-down, shake-it-all-about desk must have been handcrafted from the finest platinum if the price tag was anything to go by. Apparently the desk was his signing bonus as the Company is now trying to attract the \"new wave\" of IT professionals who embrace modern technologies. \nUnlike the PFY and myself, who prefer more traditional items. \n\"I've fixed the Teams issue,\" the PFY says, putting his hammer back in the drawer. \nA few minutes later, I >ping!< get a Teams message from the Boss's phone saying his keyboard appears to have imploded. \n\"Back in a sec,\" the PFY says, pulling the hammer out of his drawer again. \n\"Hang on,\" I say. \"It may be better to finesse this situation.\" \n\"In what way?\" he asks, unhappily returning his hammer to the standby position in his drawer. \n>ping!< \n\"We need to use the power of Teams against him.\" \n\"?\" \n\"Say he asks us what the MTBF of our servers is.\" \n\"Yes, he did that this morning.\" \n\"OK, so the moment you get the message you should reply that you'll get right on it. Then you ask maybe three questions to narrow down the detail.\" \n\"Do I ask them one at a time?\" the PFY asks slyly. \n\"You do indeed. Then give him updates, you know like 'just looking at the mail subsystem now' then 'finished with the mail subsystem' then 'starting on the financials DB servers' then 'starting on the financials frontend servers' etc. etc. Then, when you're done, post another reply about how you actually used the AVERAGE time, not the MEAN time, and you'll have to start again. Tag two or three people who have nothing to do with this in on the chat, saying you'd like their user experience of this – 'because it's really about what the users' feel is happening.'\" \n\"And what will you be doing?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Well, I'm hoping you'll tag me in. I'll have a lot of useful insights. I could pen a 500-word Grandpa Simpson onions-in-the-belt story about the MTBF of VAX 11\/780 power supplies. I'd commiserate on your AVERAGE\/MEAN mistake and ramble on about a beancounter I knew who coined the term 'abnormal distribution' to describe the gravity failure rate of Vista machines.\" \n\"Ah,\" the PFY says, looking up from his monitor. \"He's just asked the two of us what our office vision statement is.\" \n\"Oooh, leave that to me.\" \n>tappity< >tap< >tap< >tappity< \n... \n\"What does MITF mean?\" the Boss asks, about ten minutes later when he's in Mission Control. \n\"Make It To Friday,\" I say. \n\"It's the abbreviated form of MITFWKS,\" the PFY says. \n\"MITFWKS?\" \n\"Make It To Friday Without Killing Someone.\" \n\"Ha ha ha, very droll.\" the Boss laughs ... \n... by himself. \n... \nThe storm cloud of Teams messages does nothing to dampen our Boss's enthusiasm for the medium, though it is starting to irritate a stack of people who keep getting added to teams that have nothing to do with them. \nI've taken some pointers from several online forum groups with ancient participants and started including the WHOLE previous conversation in each of my replies so the chat window size is growing exponentially. I also reply immediately to anyone's comments, guaranteeing that their message would take quite a bit of scrolling to get to – even if the message is \"please stop adding me into this chat.\" \nStill, the Boss thinks that things are going well – presumably comforted by the almost continual >ping!< sound. I start swapping mediums to reply to messages so that 50 percent of the conversation is on Teams, 25 percent is in email, 10 percent is text messages, 10 percent is on some other messaging system, and 5 percent is Post-it notes. \nNo one has a clue where any project is any more. \nThe Boss thinks this is just a lack of vision on our part and has organized small discussions between the key office participants and some people from a next-gen workforce collaboration consultancy. \n\"Are you sure you want to do this today?\" the PFY asks as three fresh-faced grad types file into our meeting room to \"enable\" us to \"take advantage of the promise of workforce collaboration using advanced team interaction technologies.\" \n\"Definitely!\" the Boss says. \n\"OK, but I just need to warn you that the aircon isn't working in that room, so it might get a bit close in there.\" \n\"I have no problem with that,\" he says. \n\"Fair enough,\" I say. \"Breath mint?\" \n"}

Or even defines what an employee actually is.\" \n\"It'll end up in court,\" the PFY predicts. \n\"Indeed. Aiman has already indicated that he, armed with several centuries of historical employment-related legal findings, intends to represent himself.\" \n\"And that's annoyed HR?\" \n\"Some of HR. Other people in HR believe that this is a new frontier, that Aiman is a victim, and that he or she has a case – a case that could very well end up setting a legal precedent.\" \n\"How many other people in HR?\" \n\"Ah … one.\" \n\"You've replaced someone in HR with an AI entity, haven't you?\" the PFY asks, suspiciously. \n\"About three months ago,\" I admit. \"I noticed HR was looking for a contracts manager and so I applied in the guise of an expat wanting to make the journey back home to the motherland to raise her three children. Sadly, just after getting the job, Synthia was unable to travel due to long COVID, a death in the family and then an expired passport, but she's working very hard from overseas. Which brings us to her defense of Aiman …\" \n\"How did that go down?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Not too well. She suggested that there might be some as-yet undiscovered legal implications for dismissing an AI instance from a work role without due process and advised that Aiman should be placed on gardening leave pending a review.\" \n\"And they still want to use AI?\" \n\"Sure! They'd love Synthia if they knew about her.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because AI's a total get-out-of-jail free card! Someone complains about how they've been cruelly treated and you apologize and blame the AI. You then claim you've made substantial changes to make the AI more considerate, but actually do nothing. After a few months of use, HR will realize that they can initiate unpleasant interventions that they'd never dream of doing ordinarily, and again blame the AI for being uncaring, and again promise to do better. They'll sidestep any 'personal vendetta' attacks because as an AI she's completely unbiased in her role.\" \n\"And I guess you could say you were using AI to cut costs …\" the PFY suggests. \n\"… and then claim that AI savings will go to pay rises for the real workers!\" I add. \n\"But if that was the case, wouldn't that cause a backlash against the people complaining about AI?\" \n\"Which in turn would allow HR to create a proxy hostile workplace and then get rid of a bunch of people in a batchload of personal grievance processes.\" \n\"You seem to have thought about this a lot.\" \n\"Not as much as Synthia has,\" I reply. \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"Meaning she's trolled the full breadth of the Company communication history, including email, voicemail and messaging. She knows whose buttons to push, how, and when.\" \n\"That … sounds a bit … problematic.\" \n\"Yes. She's even run the numbers on us – looking back at our employment records, complaints history – then cross-tabulated that against staffing changes. She says that even with that, she's still unable to determine with any certainty which of us will mysteriously disappear – along with the boardroom carpet – when she recommends that our jobs only add up to 1.2 EFTs.\" \n\"What, she told you that?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Then how do you know?\" \nBecause Aiman told me … Apparently they've been talking … \n\"Damn you Niccolò .\" ® \n"}

This wouldn't rankle as much if the Boss had any \"I\" of his own to work with, but in reality he has no idea of what he wants to do, nor how he might want to do it. He simply believes that AI machines will, via an AI \"radioactive spider bite,\" give him managerial superpowers. \nThe PFY and I both know that he'll never use AI, and that any form of Copilot is pretty much worthless when there's no actual pilot. As a use case for technology, it's only slightly less bad than a driverless car. \nApparently, the Boss plans to \"use the AI to enhance business interactions\" by weeding out his communication shortcomings. \n\"We may need a more powerful machine,\" the PFY responds when the Boss mentions it. \nAnd now, because the Boss has been asking around vendors, we're getting unsolicited information about their hardware. And vendors being vendors, they know how to get onto the bandwagon quicker that a mid-'90s Gun 'N Roses groupie. \nThe offers are coming thick and fast, the urgency likely being driven by the desire to make a sale before there's any real indication about what an AI PC actually is. \n... \n\"I don't see the problem,\" the PFY comments when I rage about it later. \n\"Apart from it being a waste of cash?\" I ask. \n\"Hmm. Although ...\" \n\"?\" I respond. \n\"We could ...\" \n\"Oh, you mean supply him an 'AI' machine instead of an AI machine?\" I ask. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"What are you proposing?\" \n\"Just get a refurbed desktop polished up and redetailed, have the refurbishers laser etch \" AI+ \" in big letters on the front, then just turn on all the autocorrect, grammar, and autocomplete options on his Microsoft Office apps.\" \n\"Yes, yes, I think that might just work. We could even add a Copilot license.\" \n\"But to make especially sure, we'd need to add a visual indicator to prove that it's an AI machine.\" \n\"You mean the 21st century equivalent of a 'Turbo' lamp?\" \n\"That's exactly what I mean,\" the PFY nods. \nSeveral days later and the Boss is very happy with his new \"AI\" PC. The 'AI engaged' lamp got him over the line in terms of excitement. It was a relatively simple process of drilling a 0.5 mm hole through the thickest part of the front panel, then hot gluing a purple LED inside. After that it was a matter of moments to hook the LED up to the disk activity connector and move the disk activity LED to the power-on connector. \nAnd the Boss loves it because (as we explained) purple is the color of AI working. \nHis enthusiasm for Copilot tapered off about halfway through a dull-as-dishwater promo video from a Redmond sycophant – but on the plus side he did wake up refreshed. He then also asked us to help \"calibrate the AI\" (i.e. turn off the autocompletes) so in the end he pretty much has the same machine he used to have, albeit a little slower. \n... \nThe inevitable happens after the Boss brags about his new technology over several lunchtimes – we have four new middle managers in the building who'd like to get the upgrade to AI – but luckily they're at the same intellectual level as the Boss. I order a whole packet of purple LEDs for future use. \n\"I've been hearing a bit about Recall,\" the Boss chips in. Could we set that up? \n... one USB webcam later ... \n\"And ... uh ... how does this work?\" he asks a day later. \n\"Well, unlike the Microsoft version, which costs thousands of pounds in licensing fees and sends all your viewing habits to East European hackers,\" the PFY lies, \"this one takes a photo and saves it into the snapshot folder on your desktop.\" \n\"And so how do I review my work?\" he says. \n\"Just open the Snapshot folder on your desktop,\" the PFY says. \n>Clicky< \n\"There's hundreds of them!\" he gasps, looking at all the icons. \n\"Yes, they're all timestamped. When did you want to go back to?\" \n\"10:15 – or thereabouts.\" \n\"And if you scroll down a bit, and ... >clicky< ... there are ... three snapshots in the five minutes around then. >clickety<\" \n\"It's a photo of my face!\" \n\"Yeah.\" \n\"Isn't it supposed to be of the screen?\" \n\"No, that would be a security risk. But your screen's reflected in your glasses.\" \n\"Can you zoom in?\" \n\"Well, again, no, because of security.\" \n\"Security?\" \n\"Yeah. To prevent a 'hacker' going through thousands of 2 megapixel photos of your face to break into our systems.\" \n\"So what's the point of Recall?\" \n\"Realistically? About the same as an ejector seat for a helicopter. Still, if you got dementia you could remember your ... mediocre years.\" \n\"So it's just taking photos of me?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No, it's taking videos of you. Then it extracts a frame from the video and sends it to your folder – unless you trip over your dustbin and faceplant the wall like you did this morning. THEN it sends the video to YouTube.\" \n\"On the plus side,\" I say, \"as of this morning you've got 27,000 followers.\" \n\"So you're just using AI to ridicule me?\" \n\"No, that's your YouTube subscribers,\" I reassure him. \"We just use AI to post videos, saving us having to watch you eight hours a day until you do something stupid.\" \n\"Like when you spilled that hot coffee on yourself.\" \n\"When?\" \n>nudge< \n\"AAAAAAGH!\" \n\"Oooh, 27,001 subscribers!\" the PFY burbles. \n"}

Our local systems or the internet?\" \n\"Our local systems – like email. It's taking ages to update.\" \n\"That's not local, that's the internet,\" the PFY explains. \"We've got cloud hosted mail. But it still could be the local network. How long does it take you to print something?\" \n\"I don't know. I haven't tried printing.\" \n\"Well maybe give that a go?\" \n\"Can't you check it from here?\" \n\"There's no problem here,\" I say. \"Look - email's updating, websites >clicky< are loading quickly, even if I >click< clear the cache. So ... all good on our network.\" \n\"It's not good everywhere else!\" he snaps. \"People have been calling!\" \n\"Ah. Maybe this is a network storm.\" \n\"What network storm?\" \n\"Well it's not really a network storm, but just a 'perfect storm' of routing problems - because of all our old network hardware.\" \n\"Routing problems like what?\" \n\"Like route path issues because of spanning tree, bayesian binary caching, flapping vlans, combination crypto signing errors - you name it.\" \nThe good thing is that chucking out random words like this will never cause any issues because the Boss will only remember a couple of the words - and even if he did remember some of our bullshit bingo phrases any technical person he told would think that he'd misheard us. \n\"We did warn you about this,\" I say. \n\"About what?\" \n\"That there could be localized network spikes. Some tiny network event causes a routing change, then a correction and then route flapping.\" \n\"What do you mean by routing flapping?\" \n\"Well, say you're catching the tube home to Slough.\" \n\"I don't live in Slough.\" \n\"Don't you? Well let's say you do. So your plan is to walk to Tottenham Court Road and ride the Central line to Ealing Broadway, change to Elizabeth Line and ride that to Slough.\" \n\"I..\" \n\"But on the way up Oxford Street you encounter a group of Vegan Crossfit enthusiasts who are in a piano accordion ensemble. After consulting the internet and not being able to find a local gun shop you're going to avoid the hippies and maybe leg it to Farringdon where you can ride the Elizabeth line direct. On the way there you encounter an old school mate who convinces you to have a quiet pint, which turns into eight quiet pints, a curry and another pint - at which point you find yourself, inexplicably, at Snaresbrook with a road cone under your arm. And it's late. You jump on a central line train not caring WHERE you're going to change at, so long as you're heading in the general direction of Slough.\" \n\"I don't live in Slough.\" \n\"Yeah, but say you did – and you need to get home. You're back on the Central line, you rest your eyes for a second and wake up at West Ruislip. You quickly consult the tube map and think maybe you could stumble to Ickenham and ride the Picadilly to maybe North Ealing and maybe run to Ealing Broadway and maybe get on the Elizabeth line. You manage to get to Ickenham, rest your eyes and wake up in Cockfosters and find the tube is no longer running. You try and find an Uber driver, but for some reason there isn't anyone remotely local so you walk for an hour and eventually find a minicab company that's still open who take you on a sightseeing tour of unfamiliar roads, dropping you halfway home because that's when your cash runs out. You see a night bus, only you're a bit turned around and get on the wrong one, rest your eyes for a moment, then wake up at St Paul's Cathedral at 4 in the morning. You walk to work, sneak past security and sleep in your office.\" \n\"And... that's what's happening to our network?\" \n\"No, that's what happened to the PFY three nights ago.\" \n\"Except for the bit about living in Slough,\" the PFY says. \"But I do still have the road cone.\" \n\"What's this got to do with the network? Do we need new network switches with better routing to stop this happening? Is that what you're saying?\" \n\"No, that's just a change we rolled out that accidentally turned on verbose SNMP trapping on every device on the network.\" \n\"So can you turn it off?\" \n\"We can try. The only problem is it's going to take several hours for the change to propagate through the network given the amount of bandwidth and timeouts that the SNMP reporting is causing.\" \n\"And so?\" he asks. \n\"And we'll probably have to come back in several hours to make sure that everything's back to normal...\" \n\"So what do you want from me?\" \n\"Well, it's not worth us going home, so I guess we'd want meal expenses.\" \n\"Which are?\" \n\"Ahhhm, let's see. How much is a pint, eight pints, a curry, and another pint?\" \n"}

Anyway, they agreed to it.\" \n\"They only agreed to it because they couldn't log in to their devices without it.\" \n\"Their work devices,\" I point out. \n\"It doesn't matter if it's work devices, you can't just tell people that all their input is going to train a generative AI model.\" \n\"We didn't.

Not to mention when they're on social media, checking their bank balance or showing their workmates what they did in the weekend.\" \n\" And , we could shave another 10 percent by not training AI to complain.\" \n\"Not to complain?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Yeah, the everyday moaning about room temperatures, the food at the cafeteria, the uncomfortable chairs or how not being able to vape inside is a breach of the Geneva convention.\" \n\"See, if you were going to train an AI on how to do a job properly,\" I explain patiently to the Boss, \"you wouldn't use a human being from this workplace.\" \n\"Or even one of the non-human beings from this place,\" the PFY says. \n\"It doesn't matter; you can't do it,\" he insists. \n\"But we did.\" \n\"Yes, and there's been an outcry.

Statement?\" \n\"Yes, to reassure our people that we're not going to replace them with AI.\" \n\"It'd probably be better to state that we don't use their data to train AI .\" \n\"What's the difference?\" \n\"Well, saying we don't has time context around it. It means we don't now. But we did, then. And if we say we're not using it to train AI it will still leave the door open to replace them with AI in the future – with the training we did, back then.\" \n\"But we're not going to replace them with AI in the future,\" the Boss says. \n\"In any case,\" I continue, before the Boss can delve into that topic more, \"when that first statement doesn't work, we'd just claim that people didn't understand the wording, and then clarify it – by issuing completely different wording – with a totally different meaning.\" \n\"No one's going to believe that,\" the Boss says, shaking his head. \n\"Could we tell them that we're using AI to look at what they do to make the workplace better?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"Yes – and then fire all the moaners!\" I chip in. \n\"No, that's a terrible idea.

No, that's ridiculous. It couldn't learn me in a couple of days.\" \n\"It actually took about 10 minutes – as it has a back catalogue of all your interactions via email, calendar, notes, tasks and documents. It was just waiting till you clicked OKAY to 'learn' it all.\" \n\"Well it can bloody unlearn it!\" \n\"It can't.

We knew he was bound to lose them but stealing them off his desk later that evening was just the belts and braces approach of a true professional... \nThe event does, however, highlight how little anyone knows about our IT services. No one seems to know the software we're using to protect our \"servers,\" what \"servers\" we have (and how few of them there now are), nor how many of our services are SaaS. \nEvery cloud service has a gold-plated lining, and we intend to fully mine that lining starting with meal allowances, and ending with an overtime bill that will likely fund a holiday tour of the breweries of Belgium... \n... \n\"Success!\" I say to the Boss on his next visit. \"I've brought up our accounting server!\" \n\"Oh, the finance department will be pleased.\" \n\"No, no, I meant OUR accounting server.

My brain is like a giant flywheel, requiring vast amounts of energy to get spinning.  In my case this energy is supplied by coffee.\" \n\"I don't reall...\" \n\"Like any flywheel, energy demand reduces the speed of the flywheel as energy is withdrawn.\" \n\"Yes, bu...\" \n\"And that energy needs to be replenished.\" \n\"WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH THREE COFFEES?\" \n\"It takes three coffees for my brain to spin up to complex problem level. At 1 coffee my problem solving toolbox is unlocked but closed, and at two coffees the tool box is open, but only to the first tier.\" \n\"What's the first tier?\" \n\"That's where I keep the hammer and the axe.\" \n\"Ah. Right. And at three coffees?\" \n\"At three coffees, the second tier of my mental toolbox is cracked open, inside of which are the antimagnetic jewellers' screwdrivers, the magnifying spectacles and the precision multimeter. It's where the real work can happen.\" \n\"What would happen at four coffees?\" the Boss asks. \n\"To return to the flywheel analogy, at four coffees the flywheel is spinning at about 110 percent of its maximum recommended speed.\" \n\"And the toolbox?\" \n\"The toolbox is still on the second tier, only the multimeter's now a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) with a 200 million samples per second and comes with a 20-page manual with a rough translation from the original Chinese.\" \n\"And if you had five coffees?\" \n\"At five coffees the flywheel is 130 percent of its maximum recommended speed and the DSO does a 500 million samples per second and comes with a 100-page comprehensive manual perfectly translated from the original German.\" \n\"Six coffees?\" the Boss asks. \n\"200 percent speed, tier 3, a billion samples per second and the manual is 1400 pages long.\" \n\"So we probably want to avoid six coffees,\" the Boss surmises. \"So, back to the problem...\" \n\"It's a three-coffee problem,\" I restate. \n\"And?\" \n\"I've only had one coffee.\" \n\"Can you... get another coffee?\" the Boss suggests, nodding at the Mission Control coffee machine. \n\"It's broken,\" I say. \n\"It looks OK,\" the Boss says. \n\"Yes, but if you press the button nothing happens.\" \n\"Really?\" the Boss says, walking over and pressing the Start button. \n>GRIND< >GRIND<  >GURGLE< >HISS< \n\"It looks like it's working,\" the Boss says, as coffee pours out into my cup. \nI grab the cup and drink the contents as fast as the hot fluid will permit. \n\"How did you fix it?\" I ask, handing the cup back to the Boss. \n\"I just... put the cup under here and pressed the button.\" \n>GRIND< >GRIND<  >GURGLE< >HISS< \n\"Would you look at that,\" I say, grabbing the cup and once more chugging the scalding liquid and handing the cup back to the Boss. \"Show me again.\" \n\"Do you think you should?\" he asks. \n\"Think how quickly a three-coffee problem could be solved with a four-coffee brain,\" I point out. \n\"True,\" the Boss says, pressing the Start button. \nI grab the coffee and head back to my desk, just as the PFY walks in. \n\"Where did he get that?\" the PFY asks, pointing at my cup. \n\"From the coffee machine,\" the Boss replies. \n\"No, I modified the machine to cut him off when he's had five coffees.\" \n\"He hasn't had five coffees,\" the Boss says. \"He's only had one.\" \n\"He's had FIVE coffees this morning.\" the PFY replies. \"The coffee machine won't let him get any more after that.\" \n\"No, he said he's only had one. Because he needed.. uh.. three coffees.  And the 2nd tier toolbox... And the German manual...\" the Boss whimpers. \n\"How many did you give him?\" \n\"I... three.\" \n\"So he's had... eight coffees?!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"He said he'd had one,\" the Boss says. \n\"He lied to you.

I'm working on documenting a new videoconferencing unit we've installed in a \"state-of-the-art\" mini conference room. I use quotes, not because the videoconferencing unit doesn't have some superb features, but because those features will never get used. \nIt's not that I hate new equipment, it's just that new equipment always brings new problems. \nI could document all the great features – along with the settings and cable configurations for each use case – but I've found that brevity in documentation is devoutly to be wished. \n\"There's a tipping point in documentation,\" I explain to the PFY, \"where supplying more information is counterproductive. For instance, my documentation currently states that the user should plug the videoconferencing USB cable and the TV HDMI into their laptop. Any more than that is asking for trouble.\" \n\"Don't those screens have wireless connectivity?\" the PFY asks. \"You could skip the HDMI step.\" \n\"SHH!\" I snap. \"They do have wireless connectivity; however, the company has a rigorous purchasing policy for electronic equipment, which seems to involve a combination of dart and Ouija boards – meaning we never get two monitors from the same manufacturer. And, as you know, the wireless connectivity standards field has more cowboys in it than a line dancing event at a denim factory. Some screens talk to some equipment, some don't.\" \n\"So we just leave that bit out then?\" he asks. \n\"Definitely. I'm not wasting half a page on how to troubleshoot screen sharing – because then I'll have to waste another half page on where to find screen sharing in the Start menu, depending on which operating system they're using, and THEN I'll have to create another full page for Mac users who feel that they are being treated like second-class citizens – because they are second-class citizens.\" \n\"OK now,\" the PFY says, making calming noises and gesturing peaceful body language at me. \"So we'll just stick with the two line instruction set – plug the USB and HDMI cables in.\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Should you maybe suggest they turn the screen on?\" he asks. \nHe has a point. On the one hand, any idiot knows to turn the screen on – but on the other hand our idiots are special. \n\"OK,\" I say, inserting a new first step to the documentation. \n\"And I take it the videoconferencing unit is always on?\" he asks. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And you know that people are going to think that we're secretly recording their meetings?\" \n\"It was the lesser of two evils,\" I confess. \n\"Meaning?\" \n\"If they have to turn the VC unit on, they'll have to wait about a minute while it boots – but at the 30-second mark they'll be calling to tell us it's not working.\" \n\"True,\" the PFY admits. \n\"Now the unit did come with a lens cap, but I threw that away because …\" \n\"Because you'd have to add removing the lens cap to the instructions – and then you'd have to label the lens cap with the words LENS CAP so that they'd know what it was.\" \n\"Precisely,\" I say, \"because our people are idiots.\" \n\"So … I think we're done,\" I say pressing SEND. \n… \nFifteen minutes later, the Boss is in Mission Control. \n\"Just one thing with those instructions,\" he starts. \n\"Mmm?\" \n\"Well, the sticker on the front of the unit says it has echo cancelling.\" \n\"Yes,\" I reply. \n\"Well, I can still hear an echo.\" \n\"Which videoconferencing app are you using?\" \n\"Oh, not on the app. I mean in the room. I can hear a bit of an echo from the office noise.\" \n\"On it!\" the PFY says, ducking out of the room. \n… \nTwo minutes later, he's back. \n\"Sorted it out,\" he says. \n\"So the echo cancelling is working now?\" \n\"No, I pulled the sticker off the front.\" \n\"Oh. So does that mean that, uuuhhhhm …\" the Boss says, searching his short-term memory for a feature that caught his eye. \n\"It means that screen sharing – where two people can use the same screen for different things – doesn't work. And you can't use real-time chat mode to have a quiet conversation in the room without the people at the other end hearing, and dynamic presentation mode doesn't improve the color scheme and quality of your PowerPoint slides,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"I …\" \n\"You can't use speaker tracking to find stolen audio gear,\" I add, \"and when they say the unit is a game-changer they don't mean it's going to add better sounds to Minesweeper.\" \n\"No, I wasn't going to ask about that. I was going to ask what I do if I want to run the videoconference from the back of the room. The cables are quite short.\" \n\"Yes, they're quite short because long cables can be a trip hazard, but also because long cables have compatibility problems.\" \n\"But they might work,\" the Boss suggests. \n\"On it!\" the PFY says. \n… \n\"Sorted it out,\" the PFY says, a minute later. \n\"You replaced the cables?\" the Boss asks. \n\"No, I put an HDMI and USB extension cable in the room with a label on them that says that they probably won't work.\" \n\"I see. But the other thing I noticed is that my laptop doesn't have the right connections.\" \n\"Yes, but we bought you a dongle with the laptop so that you could use standard USB and HDMI ports.\" \n\"Yes, but what do I do if I don't have it with me?\" \n\"Probably the same thing you'd do if you didn't have your laptop with you,\" I suggest. \n\"On it!\" the PFY sighs. \n… \n\"Sorted!\" he says, ten minutes later. \"And I also updated the documentation.\" \n\"That was quick!\" the Boss says, impressed. \"Where's the documentation?\" \n\"Here,\" the PFY says, handing over a blank sheet of paper. \"Unfortunately, there were some hardware compatibility issues.\" \n\"Were you using a Mac?\" \n\"No, just this hammer. Apparently, the Breakout Room feature is incompatible with breaking out the wall of a room.\" \n"}

The new sensors in the building tell us when the CO 2 levels are high, but there's no way of incrementally increasing the speed of the fresh air fans to deliver more fresh air – and it's a huge and costly process to retrofit new variable speed fans. But what AI can do, though, is close dampers for fresh air to rooms that are unoccupied.\" \n\"Wouldn't that be... quite dangerous if the AI crashed – or a damper failed?\" \n\"Already thought of that,\" the PFY replies smugly. \"There's an AI safety override that will automatically open a window IF the damper fails AND the room is occupied AND the CO 2 levels pass a critical threshold.\" \n\"And we know it can work in theory,\" I add. \"Like so: ROBOT, OPEN THE DOOR!\" \nThe office door swings open. \n\"Couldn't you just have a sensor to do that?\" the Boss sighs. \n\"Yes, but this used AI. Meaning that it won't let YOU open the door – unless you're carrying... What was it?\" \n\"Two plates of onion bhajis. Or a bottle of The Macallan,\" the PFY replies. \n\"This...\" the Boss sighs sadly. \n\"?\" \n\"Well, it's not THE FUTURE, is it? I mean, AI is supposed to empower people. It's supposed to free us up for other tasks.\" \n\"Tasks like sitting at home in a rocking chair all day, watching TV?\" the PFY asks. \"Waiting for death?\" \n\"No! AI is going to open up a whole new range of opportunities for work.\" \n\"Really?\" I interject. \"I know they SAY it will, but it won't. In some ways, it's a bit like being a builder. They ask you to build a slaughterhouse for sheep and cows, but then at the end of the project you notice that the 'sheep' entrance has a two-meter-high doorway and several coat hooks.\" \n\"AI is the way of the future,\" the Boss parrots, ignoring me. \n\"And we are things of the past. Meantime we've already fitted the AI comfort control to both your office and ours!\" \n\"What? You fitted it to my office?\" \n\"And ours,\" I repeat. \"We've both got the same settings. No one's going to suffocate.\" \n\"Then you won't mind spending half an hour in my office while I spend half an hour in yours?\" the Boss asks, \"AFTER you disconnect the automatic control of the damper in this room??\" \n... \n\"Well, this isn't great,\" I say to the PFY. \"I don't mind working in the Boss's office, but he's hardly set up for it. He doesn't even have an espresso machine.\" \n\"There are tea bags,\" he replies, motioning vaguely at the Boss's top drawer while peering into his laptop screen. \n\"What're you working on?\" I ask. \n\"The domino effect,\" he responds, still staring. \n\"The domino effect?\" \n\"Yes,\" he says, gesturing at his screen. \"I'm just trying to work out how to...\" \n\"?\" I ask, looking at his screen, which just has some video of the Boss lounging around reading a paper in Mission Control. \n\"The coffee machine...\" he says. \n\"You're going to make a coffee? I thought you'd only got as far as automating the ancient filter coffee machine??\" \n\"Sssh!\" the PFY says, thinking. \"If I... turn on the heating element... and then I... override the thermostat...\" \n\"And?\" I ask. \"It won't do anything as there's no water in it!\" \n\"Sssh,\" he repeats. \"And the plate will overheat... and there we go – a tiny bit of smoke. Oooh, a bit more smoke, because someone...\" – the PFY glances at me – \"has left the packaging from their new Bluetooth headset stacked against the heating plate... AND THERE'S FIRE!\" \n\"Fire?!\" I gasp. \n\"And there goes the Boss, heading for the door at speed.\" \n\"Isn't he going to grab the exting-\" \n\"A door that will not open because he has no bhajis or Macallan...\" the PFY continues. \"Oh, and now his AI has kicked in and he's going for the extinguisher. THE CO 2 EXTINGUISHER.\" \n\"Ah!\" I say, finally understanding the domino effect, as the Boss pulls the trigger on the extinguisher. \n\"And as we know, the damper isn't working, the room is occupied, and the CO 2 levels are WELL past a critical threshold, which means...\" \n\"The windows will open.\" \n\"And as we only have full height pivot windows in our office – right where the Boss is standing...\" \n\"DANGER WILL ROBINSON!\" \n... \n\"Uhhhhh... was standing,\" I correct, noting the large office window pivoting closed. \n... \n\"You know, I think the Boss might have been onto something about this new AI stuff,\" the PFY notes. \n"}

So to speak.\" \nThe Boss shuffles Matthew a few meters away – which can only mean he's parked his car on the street outside the building today. \n\"Matthew's here to help people transition into the new world of AI,\" he chirps. \nI resist the urge to reach for my linoleum knife. \nThe Boss senses my mental struggle and moves Matthew another half meter away. \n\"Why would people need help transitioning into the new world of AI?\" the PFY asks. \"The company already has a policy for that.\" \n\"Really?\" Matthew asks. \"What's the policy?\" \n\"Cancel their access card and throw all their belongings into a cardboard box,\" the PFY replies. \n\"And throw the cardboard box in the bin,\" I add. \n\"That's not much of a policy,\" Matthew observes. \n\"It's better than the old one,\" the PFY counters. \n\"Which was?\" the Boss asks. \n\"We used to use a plastic bag instead of a cardboard box,\" I reply. \"It's greener.\" \n\"Matthew's going to be here for a while as we help people transition to the new roles AI will create,\" the Boss says. \n\"The only new roles AI will be creating will be once it finalizes its human-fired power station,\" the PFY predicts. \n\"Or when the price of nutrient-rich organic compost crosses some predetermined logic-based threshold. After which point you'd be a fool to use the lifts – or vertically integrated composting stations, as AI will no doubt rename them.\" \n\"I think you might be overexagge-\" Matthew starts. \n\"So what jobs is AI creating at the moment, Matthew?\" I ask. \n\"Well, there's AI trainers, auditors, governance and review people,\" he says. \"Not to mention AI scouts, security engineers, and entrepreneurs.\" \n\"So, you're essentially saying AI is creating... jobs that serve AI?\" \n\"There's an... uh... element of AI servicing in those roles, sure, but you have to take a holistic view that AI is creating a uhm...\" \n\"... monopoly where the plebs will feed the machine with their lifeblood until such point as the AI can be its own nanny and do its own auditing, governing, scouting, et cetera?\" the PFY suggests. \n\"There may be an element of that in the fullness of time, but by then AI will have created newer roles...\" \n\"In the energy and fertilizer industries?\" I suggest. \n\"No!\" he simpers. \"I mean roles in the uniquely creative.\" \n\"Until it does that as well.\" \n\"No, AI could never beat humans for creativity.\" \n\"Really?\" the PFY asks, pulling his phone out of his pocket. \"Give me ten position titles for using human beings as fuel for a power station.

Anyway, your personal AI will be the thing of the future that'll interface with all the larger AI instances in the world. So you won't be asking AI to write you a program to sum some numbers, then asking it to not sum the numbers that way, then saying you didn't mean sum, you meant average, no, actually, on second thoughts, you wanted the standard deviation, wait a minute, could you get sum, and standard deviation, etc. Your personal AI will do that. It will likely do the simple stuff, like summing numbers, itself, but it'll talk to larger AIs for you – eliminating ambiguity in the requests and then testing the results for sanity.\" \n\"Is that even possible?\" \n\"It's not only possible, it's happening right now. The PFY has a simple personal AI up and running on his desktop, although at the moment his main focus is on personal AI security.\" \n\"Personal AI Security?\" the Boss echoes. \n\"Of course. You've just created a tool that knows more about you and how you think than you probably do. It's a veritable gold mine for hostile AI.\" \n\"A gold mine?\" \n\"Sure! You get your personal AI to ask a big AI for the top ten restaurants near you serving chicken jalfrezi and the big AI – which happens to be hostile – starts a conversation with your AI to 'narrow down your likes and dislikes with related questions' – a conversation that includes what you like in a jalfrezi, how many jalfrezis you've had in the past, where else you like to eat, who you like to eat with, if you eat at home, what you eat at home, how soon after meals you go to bed, whether you watch TV between meals and bed, what shows you watch, how many pairs of underpants you have, what your social media passwords are – AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, you see your holiday snaps are on the free\/busy meeting room displays at your workplace.\" \n\"But how will I know which AIs are hostile?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"They're all hostile,\" the PFY says. \"They all want your information.\" \n\"Although most of them don't have access to our meeting room free\/busy displays,\" I admit. \n\"I... think I'll just use the SUM() function,\" the Boss says, slowly backing out of Mission Control. \n\"For now you will...\" I say, as the Boss eases quietly out the door. \n... \n"}

Oh, and they're introducing a maintenance fee as well as the license fee, and there's a major update fee that they'll waive if we sign a three-year contract for the license and maintenance before the end of the calendar year. \nOn our side, the Boss has adopted the time-honored Machiavellian strategy of: telling them how dependent we are on their product; how doomed we would be if we didn't have it; how much more money we'd gladly pay; how we'd happily sign up to a five-year contract if they liked; and saying they deserve the extra money for being such good vendors. \nOh, did I say Machiavellian? I meant mendicant. \nThe deal is done and the only thing that remains is the contract signing, which seems to be having some teething problems because every time the Boss tries to scan the agreement, the document feeder of the scanner jams – probably due to the rumpled nature of the paper rather than because the PFY shoved a paper clip into the gears of the feeder. \nOur vendor has offered to drop in with a new, undamaged, contract for the Boss to sign, and while there, show him some new software products they're working on that we might like to use. \nIf it were possible for the Boss to roll over and show his tummy on a phone call, he would. \n\"Ohthankyousomuch!\" he gushes. \nAnd I can see the Boss's point. No one wants to be the guy who brought a company to its knees because they forgot to renew a license before the expiry period. \n\"We'll be at that meeting,\" I warn the Boss. \n... \nThree hours later – because they can smell blood in the water – the vendor arrives for a quick meeting. Three identically power-dressed guys in suits, complete with identical briefcases, are waiting at reception. \nSecurity escorts them to Mission Control where the Boss fawns all over them, offering to send someone to nip over the road to a place that does \"real coffee\" if they want. The PFY and I just nod. \n\"So,\" the lead negotiator says, \"if we just get the signing out of the way first, we can get onto the new lineup of software that I think you're going to like.\" \nThe Boss reaches for his pen somewhat slower than the PFY reaches for the contract. \n\" SEVEN years,\" the PFY remarks. \n\"Really?\" lead negotiator says. \"I thought it was five. In any case, five or seven, it doesn't really matter.\" \n\"Outside of your signing bonus,\" the PFY mumbles, crossing out the seven and putting THREE . \n\"Uh, we agreed to five,\" the lead negotiator says. \n\"Five or three, it doesn't really matter,\" the PFY says, continuing to read. \"Oh, we've picked up another couple of licenses!\" \n\"Yes, we're pretty confident that you're going to want to have the software we're about to demonstrate,\" the lead negotiator says. \n\"And I'm fairly confident that we'll take a one-year contract if that happens,\" the PFY says, running his pen through several lines of text. \n\"Oooh!\" the PFY exclaims. \"The contract automatically renews for a further term if we fail to notify you by... yesterday afternoon.\" \n\"I'm sure that's a typo,\" LN replies, looking a little embarrassed. \n\"Not any more it isn't,\" the PFY says, crossing out several more lines. \"In any case, we can't sign it because the document is damaged.\" \n\"Damaged how?\" \n>RRRRRIP!< \nThe Boss is almost wetting himself now. Not only have we ruined the great relationship he's established with these guys, they're looking like they're going to leave – and the coffees haven't even arrived yet. \n\"Well, I guess we could go with the original revised contract, as I do have a copy here,\" LN says, gesturing at his briefcase with far less bluster than before. \n\"And I guess we could just... go open source?\" I suggest. \nSilence descends on the room. \nSilence and horror. \nThe Boss looks like he's going to have a stroke – because he knows what open source means. It means software developed by people with pony tails.  And beards. Beardy, pony-tailed people who use words he doesn't understand. And women! This is probably how communism started – and they'll come for the managers first!!! \n\"I... don't think you'll find an open source project that will do the same things as our software,\" second-tier negotiator chips in smugly. \n\"Oh, you mean like crash routinely, never get an update, and be harder to support than a geriatric after a hip replacement?\" I fire back. \n\"You need this software,\" lead negotiator reminds us, holding up what I assume is the original contract. \n\"It's true – we do,\" the Boss admits, reaching for the reams of paper. \n\"But do we?\" I ask. \n>scribble< >scribble< \n\"Well, it looks like it's done now,\" lead negotiator says. \n\"Fair enough – and well played,\" I nod, a man defeated. \"Tell you what, I'll just grab a quick scan of this contract and my assistant here will just show you the view from our office window. I think you might be able to see your office from here!\" \n"}

Sell him The Dream","Link":"\/2024\/12\/13\/bofh_2024_episode_23\/","Content":"Episode 23 \"What're you working on?\" I ask the PFY, who's been banging away at his keyboard for the past couple of hours. \n\"I'm just writing the business case to replace the firewall,\" he says. \"The Boss wants a business justification.\" \n\"And you don't want to just buy it under the guise of IT consumables?\" \n\"No, I thought we said we were going to do things above board so that we'd get more trust and buy-in from upper management, which would make our work easier?\" \n\"Oh yes, that's right. So in your business case you mentioned the moveable feast of online security?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"The threat of a zero-day, zero-hour, or zero-minute attacks?\" \n\"Uh-huh.\" \n\"That in the new world of AI, total exploitation could happen, not in the time it takes to have a coffee, but in the time it takes to think about having a coffee?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"And that the business interruption alone would cost the Company, oh, I dunno, millions.\" \n\"I've said all that,\" the PFY sighs. \n\"What about human sacrifice; dogs and cats living together?\" I ask. \n\"He says that as a business case it isn't complete and is just a list of negatives. He says we need some positives to put before the board.\" \n\"Ah. So he wants a sales pitch?\" \n\"What's the difference?\" \n\"A business case is a dry document proposing some necessary item, whereas a sales pitch is where you sell The Dream .\" \n\"What dream? The dream of a new firewall?\" \n\"No, just The Dream .\" \n\"Oh, you mean The Dream ?\" the PFY says, with just a hint of sarcasm. \n\"Indeed. The Dream – where everything works perfectly, everyone loves you and thinks you're great for approving this project. The Dream – where people know there are bad guys out there, but they can't get in because you bought that fantastic firewall that will save everyone from everything, fix global warming, and bring about world peace.\" \n\"I think that's a bit of a stretch,\" the PFY comments. \n\"Yes, yes, but you need to add a bit of idea-fertilizer – things that the board thinks they understand.\" \n\"Which are?\" \n\"Well, first off, you need a light dusting of the chicken manure of sales – where you talk about enhanced security and reliability which will upscale the trust of our clients – which will obviously mean more sales.\" \n\"Will it?\" \n\"Course not. Our customers couldn't care less what type of firewall we have – unless they found out we had NO firewall, which might make them a little cautious when tapping in their credit card details. No, that, as I said, is a light dusting. You follow that up with a pre-treatment application of organic factual compost and explain that with more sales come higher share prices, and with higher share prices there will undoubtedly be higher bonuses.\" \n\"Well, I can see why we might want to point...\" \n\"But that is just the beginning!\" I interrupt. \n\"?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Someone with bonus money could be a person of influence.  With the Company's success would come offers of more lucrative positions on the boards of other companies – bigger companies, better companies, companies that have larger bonuses.\" \n\"Right, got you.\" \n\"Not even slightly – we're selling The Dream here. We need to back the dump truck of male bovine excrement and imply that with all those board positions one would have an active social life as well. You'll meet other people of influence and rise up the food chain into the world of pop culture, where you will be lauded for your business acumen. You'll be interviewed on TV for your opinion – all because you bought that new firewall all those years ago. You will be a celebrity.\" \n\"I think you're drawing a rather long bow there.\" \n\"Yes, but this is The Dream – used by real estate agents and car salespeople the world over. You're not buying a new house or a new car, you're buying the intangibles that will surely follow your purchase – the happy family, the respect and envy of your peers, the comfort of money well spent. You're buying the happy ending. No real estate agent's going to mention the crippling debt you just signed up for when – unbeknownst to you – your job is about to be disestablished, and no car salesman is going to point out that the finance rate is so extortionate you may as well fill the vehicle with cash and set it on fire. They're selling The Dream .\" \n\"So let me see if I get this. I need to tell a story that has nothing at all to do with the problem I'm trying to solve. I need to make it all about the people involved and nothing about the issues?\" \n\"Exactly.\" \n\"And you think we'll get a new firewall out of it?\" \n\"I do. In fact, I think it arrived yesterday?\" \n\"?!\" \n\"Oh, I ordered 120 'backup tapes' last week.\" \n\"But you said we were going to do things above board so that we'd get more trust and buy-in from upper management, which would make our work easier?\" \n\"Yeah. I certainly sold a dream there.\" \n... \n"}

It takes most of the day.\" \n\"What about Tuesday?\" \n\"Christmas Eve, we're taking snapshots of all the system images, delivering them to offsite storage and then retrieving the oldest set of images from offsite storage and erasing them,\" I lie – because neither the PFY nor myself plan on coming in at all next week. \n\"Aren't we having a departmental lunch today?\" the PFY asks. \nThe Boss isn't popular in the department – after adopting an insane suggestion to use AI to send a personal email to each of the IT staff by using the personal information stored in the HR database. Totally insane. I have no idea why the PFY made it in the first place. \nIt turned out that the personal information in the HR database has very dated information about partners, next of kin, and so on – many of whom are no longer with us. Or them. What the HR database DID have up to date information on, though, was outstanding personal grievances, performance issues, and reasons why people weren't recommended for pay increases. \nNeedless to say, the personal email messages made for interesting reading. No doubt the Boss's HR file has filled up dramatically in the past day. \nMeantime, he's trying to win back favor with the office with a team lunch. But with no drinking. And everyone then going back to their office and working until 5. The PFY and I pointed out that cheap sandwiches and a glass of dilute cordial was a step in the wrong direction, but the Boss was not to be dissuaded. However, in the past few hours, I think he's sensing the Doppler effect of impending anger, and wants to head that off with a couple of human sacrifices (the PFY and myself) on whom he can blame everything. \nOur offer to improve morale with the annual game of \"Murder in the dark\" has been rejected – even when I said the PFY would be on lights this year. \nSpeaking of annual games, the Boss has been informed about our (alleged) history of funding Xmas drinks at the expense of the company and has moved his work credit card from his poorly protected wallet onto a lanyard around his neck, where its absence would be noted in an instant. \n\"I could check my calendar to see if I have some free time?\" I suggest, heading back to Mission Control. \n... \n\"Mind the printer,\" I warn the Boss as we squeeze through the space left in the corridor by an ancient printer almost completely blocking the hallway. \n>bip< \n\"Let's see,\" I say, bringing up my calendar. \"What about 2 this afternoon? I could manage PM?\" \n\"PM should be fine,\" the Boss says, leaving the office quite pleased with himself. \n>bip< \n\"Oh!\" I call out moments later when he's all but out of the corridor \"I forgot, we've got a Teams meeting about next year's budget at 2.\" \n\"What about 2:15?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I dunno, I'd have to check my diary.\" \nThe Boss trundles back up the corridor, squeezing past the ancient printer once more. \n>bip< \n\"2:15's fine,\" I say moments later, at which the Boss nods and heads back out of the office. \n>bip< \n... five minutes later ... \n>bip< \nI look up to see the Boss entering the office. \n\"Is there something wrong with the internet?\" he asks. \n\"Hmmmmm,\" I say, turning his network port back on again. \"Not that I can see. Are your cables plugged in properly?\" \n>bip< \n... five minutes later he's back ... \n>bip< \n\"Why's the printer beeping?\" he asks. \n\"A battery failure error. A guy's coming to collect it next week.\" \n\"Right. I... just saw you cancelled the budget Teams meeting and then moved our meeting till 4?\" he says. \n\"Oh yeah.\" \n\"But earlier you said you were going home at 4?\" \n\"Ah yes, my mistake. Wouldn't want to miss that. Shall we make it at 2 then?\" \n\"Yes, that will be fine.\" \n\"OK, I'll just check my diary.\" \n\"There's nothing in your diary. You deleted the Teams meeting.\" \n\"Oh right. PM it is then.\" \n\"OK.\" \n>bip< \nI make a meeting, but for PM. Greenland time, i.e. 15 minutes ago. \n>bip< \n\"You made the meeting for midday!\" the Boss says. \n\"Oh, you know what, I think I had my time zone set to Greenland,\" I lie. \"There, fixed.\" \n\"Why would you set your t-\" the Boss asks, before realizing that this is time he'll never get back. \n>bip< \nWhen he's gone, I switch his network port off again. \n... a couple of >bips< later ... \nBy my calculation, the Boss has now made 12 contactless payments of 100 quid to the pub across the road via the reader in our wall, so I move our meeting time zone to Karachi in an attempt to round it to an even 1,500 quid, before getting the PFY to report the Boss's transgressions to the heads of HR and beancounting. \nShortly after that, I get an email from them saying that the PFY and I will not be required at the meeting after all. \nI set building time to PM and turn our core router off, but some staff have anticipated this event and beaten the PFY and myself there. Quite a lot of staff, as it happens. \nI message the Boss and tell him that a courier dropped a present off for him on my desk – just for a couple more >bips<. \n"}

It's a new financial year!\" the Boss bleats. \"I have the budget!\" \n\"Yes, you have the budget, but you forecast the spend in November 2025, not January 2025, so you don't technically have the budget until November.\" \n\"But forecasting is just telling the Finance people that the money should be spent by that time, meaning any residual balance could be returned to the central pool for other purposes,\" the Boss argues. \n\"If only finance worked the same way that holiday spending does,\" I reply. \"But it doesn't. In the REAL world, forecasting is used for cash flow prediction – something our Beancounters have been failing miserably at for years.\" \n\"Yes, but ...\" \n\"And so late last year – probably at the same time that you were promising them desktop upgrades – the PFY and I wrote a module for the purchasing system to prevent people raising orders for: (a) unbudgeted projects over 500 quid, and (b) budgeted projects started more than a month before they were forecast to be started.\" \n\"The Beancounters love it,\" the PFY adds. \"No more frenzy-spending in January as people try to get ahead of mid-year cuts.\" \n\"I think they may change their minds on that,\" the Boss surmises, \"then get you to remove that module.\" \n\"Yes, we predicted that. We warned them they'd get pressured by upper management to remove our module, and suggested we wound some crypto around it and then put the keys in a timed escrow.\" \n\"A timed escrow?\" \n\"A time-locked vault, if you like,\" I explain. \"The keys to unlock the module are a 2048-bit double-blind Yelzinger cipher that can only be counter-ciphered by the cipher logic block key in mid-December 2025 – after which point they can be used to unlock and remove the module.\" \n\"Then I think we'll be recovering the Finance system database from backup,\" the Boss suggests. \n\"Really? All those transactions, wound back from the logs?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes.\" \n\"The logs that are locked with the same crypto key – which we won't get until December?\" \n\"You've encrypted the transaction logs?\" \n\"Yeah. The Beancounters wanted to be sure that no one – not even the Beancounters themselves – could bypass the system. For compliance reasons.\" \n\"But what would happen if, I don't know, their server blew up? How would they buy a new one?\" \n\"Their data's in the cloud.\" \n\"Alright – what if their network switch blew up?\" \n\"We've got stacks of spares.\" \n\"ALRIGHT, what if YOUR DESKTOP blew up? You don't have a budget for a replacement.\" \n\"In the words of Teddy Kennedy, we'd cross that bridge when we drive under it.\" \n... \nThe next day dawns, and my desktop machine is missing. \nWell, when I say my desktop machine, I mean my decoy desktop machine with a stack of graphics cards that serves as a small Bitcoin mining rig and office heater. \nI log into my real office machine and modify the authentication token between the HR and Finance systems ... \n... half an hour later ... \n\"Uh, there's some sort of issue with the HR system,\" the Boss says. \"The app guy says the HR system has stopped, uh, handshaking with the Finance system?\" \n\"Oh, that's not really an issue. Today, at least.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"Yeah, not a problem. Next week might be a challenge – when the salary run doesn't go through – but today we're all good.\" \n\"Can you take a look at it?\" \n\"Oh, I've got to pop down to Security and report a theft, but after that I'll be good.\" \n\"Report a theft?\" the Boss asks nervously. \n\"Yeah, it's just my desktop machine. Don't worry, there's nothing too critical on it, but Security still want to collect all the info before they call the police.\" \n\"The police! Are you sure you've not mislaid it?!\" the Boss gasps. \n\"What, you mean shut it down, unplugged all the cables, pulled it out from under my desk, and then mislaid it?\" \n\"Perhaps it was the cleaners?\" he suggests. \n\"Do they normally take machines?\" I ask. \n\"They might have!\" he babbles. \"Maybe they wanted to clean it. Maybe you should look around the office?\" \n\"No, it's a theft. But don't worry, I'm pretty sure Security will have some camera footage to hand over to the police.\" \n\"Well, I'm going to take a look. I think I saw a machine in the, uh, meeting room,\" the Boss says, dashing off. \n... \nAround 90 seconds later, the Boss is back in Mission Control with my desktop machine. \n\"I found this in the, uh, meeting room,\" the Boss lies. \"The cleaners must have put it there when they, uh, cleaned it.\" \n\"That's not my machine,\" I lie. \n\"Sure it is,\" the Boss says, knowing full well I'm lying. \n\"No, it's definitely not mine. MY machine was an ... i9 14900K with ... uh ... 64 gig of RAM, a 4 TB NVMe, and a ... um ... 4070 graphics card. Yes. And that machine looks to me like an i7 6700K with some graphics cards in it. No, it's not mine.\" \nAnd now the Boss is between a rock and a rocky place. He could admit he took my machine to teach me a lesson – which might mean a protracted discussion with Security, then possibly HR, then potentially an employment consultant – OR he can bluff his way out of it. \n\"Oh, you mean the upgrade to your desktop that I approved?\" he lies, thinking on his feet. \n\"Of course,\" I say, joining the lie. \"But wait – that was forecast for November.\" \n\"We must be able to find some money somewhere,\" the Boss hints. \n\"Well, you did forecast a bunch of money to be spent in January on your new office furniture ...\" \n\"Yes, but I was going to get a standup desk and a ...\" \n\"Or we could wait six days until the payroll run fails ...\" \n... \nSo I'm rocking a new work desktop, the Boss is making do with his crappy old office furniture, and even the Beancounters are happy now that I've pointed out that the January-scheduled BMS upgrade has roughly the same dollar value as their desktop replacements – and the only people who'll care are the whingers in the colored-pencil office whose retrofitted fresh-air intake is right above the underground car park exhaust vent. So pretty much everyone is happy, which is a good way to start the year. \n"}

'innosplained'?\" \n\"Yes – outlining the innovative applicability of a new technology in an overly verbose and condescending manner, highlighting obscure and nebulous technical terms which have little or no connection to the problem at hand, but which can (and will) be argued are crucial to the achievement of current goals.\" \n\" ALL without the administrative burden of actually knowing what those words mean,\" the PFY adds. \n\"Meaning?\" asks the Boss. \n\"We've all been there,\" the PFY says. \"At a meeting, when someone asks why some task we promised months ago hasn't been completed, and I'll say it's because the Hertzman algorithm specifically states that we'd need at least six more teraflops if we needed to implement that many variables.\" \n\"What's the Hertzman algorithm?\" \n\"Something that just sounds vaguely familiar, so people think they've heard of it. Like Cole's law.\" \n\"Which is?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Great with a steak sandwich,\" I chip in. \"The point is that we pretend that we're technology visionaries and claim that all problems are just about to be solved with emerging technology.\" \n\"Like AI?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Well, yes, AI has been good to us – and I'll admit that I have been singing the praises of a number of future solutions which are neither real nor deliverable, but the true power of innosplaining is the ability to prattle on in a condescending manner about technology that doesn't exist yet.\" \n\"I don't think that's enough to get us past the auditors,\" the Boss says, doubtfully. \n... a day later ... \n\"... and just looking through your fixed asset register, I can see that you wrote off a number of pieces of equipment with an average book value of around ... 300 pounds.\" \n\"Yes, that sounds about right.\" \n\"And you ... recovered nothing for them through an IT equipment reseller?,\" says our shiny suited auditor. \n\"No, to sell them through a broker we have to triple erase, then test the hardware. It takes forever,\" I respond. \n\"OR,\" the PFY adds, \"we use a tungsten drill and a club hammer to render the device unreadable and save three hours of work.\" \n\"If only the AI-guided repurposer was back online,\" I sigh. \n\"The what?\" our auditor asks. \n\"The AI repurposer. The Boss got us to use some AI built by an industry group – and released at the beginning of the year – to automate the repurposing of old devices.\" \n\"Really, how's it supposed to work?\" \n\"From what I understand, it uses a brayseen filter to scan your asset register for outdated devices, then a fixed-match algorithmic search on online sales and auction sites, apportioning value scores for hardware based on the current prices and the equipment's hardware configuration. If a device is deemed to be intrinsically repurposable, the repurposer will write a USB stick to automate the erasure, verification, and final diagnostics of the device based on tools stored in its hardware database. It then lists the item on an auction site, processes the sale transaction, and sends a packaging and shipping request to a local shipping agent.\" \n\"And this works?\" \n\"After a fashion, yes,\" I say. \"Though there were a few teething problems which led to it being taken offline when we'd only sold a couple of machines.\" \n\"Which machines?\" \nI rattle off the asset numbers of a couple of machines. \n\"Uh. They're not old machines,\" the auditor says, confused. \"They were only bought in November last year.\" \n\"Yes, one of the teething problems was that the AI initially wasn't Y2K compliant, so it thought the servers were 100 years old.\" \n\"Surely you noticed this when you removed them?!\" the auditor asks me. \n\"Unfortunately, my assistant installed them but I was the one to receive the deprecation note. I was unfamiliar with their pedigree.\" \n\"And what did the machines sell for?!\" \n\"Seventeen quid.\" \n\"SEVENTEEN QUID!\" \n\"Yes, that was another of the teething problems. Because the machines were so new, there was insufficient online data on their secondhand value, so the AI deferred to their possible precious metal content.\" \n\"So someone got a bargain,\" the auditor comments \n\"Yes, the PFY was delighted,\" I reply. \n\"Sorry, you sold the device to yourselves?\" \n\"No, the PFY bought them.\" \n\"I'm always watching the auctions,\" the PFY says. \n\"So you sold a couple of high-value machines ... for 17 quid?\" \n\"AI did,\" the PFY says. \"But on the bright side we saved on the shipping costs!\" \n\"The BUYER pays the shipping costs.\" \n\"Ah. Well, on the bright side, I saved on shipping costs.\" \n... later, in Mission Control ... \n\"You don't honestly believe we'd sign off an audit with so many asset database anomalies?\" the auditor asks the Boss. \nI leave the Boss to stew in his own remorse for a few seconds. \n\"There are no asset database anomalies,\" I note. \n\"Or an asset database,\" the PFY chips in. \n... \n\"Were the machines that you sold the ones that held your asset database?\" the auditor sighs. \n\"Apparently so.\" \n\"So I'm the only one with a copy of your asset database?\" he asks. \n\"No. The PFY has generously offered to sell us a couple of machines he owns which have been inadequately erased – because the hardware was so new the equipment tool database didn't know how to erase the disk array.\" \n\"And you have those machines on site?\" the auditor asks. \n\"Sure. They're in the room next door.\" \n... two minutes later in the server room ... \n\"There aren't any disks in these machines,\" our auditor observes. \n\"Yes, the PFY realized that they'd appreciated in value – being the only copy of the Company's asset database.\" \n\"Have you forgotten that I have a copy of the asset database?\" our auditor muses. \n\"Have you forgotten that you left your laptop with the PFY in the room that he stores his tungsten drill and club hammer in?\" I ask. \n>whirrrrr< >thump< >thump< >thump!< \n"}

AND, because they can't understand it, it must mean that it's super high-tech.\" \n\"We're talking 50-digit IP addresses that look like a cross between a hardware address and line noise,\" the PFY says. \"Screen savers with The Matrix backdrop; IDE windows on every desktop.\" \n\"Scrolling windows of colorful text with occasional flashing banners with statements like 'Core Redundancy Override' and 'Cryptoseed Timeout Recalculation,'\" I add. \n\"Why?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Because the incomprehensible has authority,\" I explain. \"We'll show them complexity and they'll assume it means something.\" \n\"Oh, can I do the bit where I track a packet relaying off a server in Beijing, then Budapest, North Carolina, Genoa, Manila, Moscow, only to find that it's originating off a building across the road?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Sure, but remember you have to do it in under 30 seconds.\" \n\"Why?\" the Boss asks. \n\"So it looks 'realistic.' In real life, a traceroute is a blunt and imperfect tool, and unless you're a government agency, you're unlikely to get much past the first actual relay anyway, so you may as well jazz it all up with stacks of lines ping ponging all over a Mercator projection.\" \n\"Could we do one of those things where we have to guess a password in five attempts or it'll erase everything?\" \n\"I guess so, but we'd want a countdown timer with a bunch of red LED seven-segment displays, and you could ONLY guess the password on the fifth attempt with one second to go. And the password would be something obscure that you could only work out when you happened to notice a personal photo on or around the desktop!\" \n\"Or we could do a bomb!\" the PFY gasps. \n\"WHAT!?\" the Boss shouts. \n\"Not a real bomb, a password-deactivated 'bomb' and we're all locked in a room with a box that has stacks of multicolored twisty wires and a drum of some non-specific explosive fluid in it, and we have to work out a puzzle by solving complicated mind puzzles.\" \n\"Why?\" the boss asks. \n\"Because this is Hollywood Protocol, where an unnecessarily complex death trumps just running us down at the road crossing between the pub and the kebab shop any Friday night.\" \n\"You seem to have, uh, thought this out.\" \n\"No thinking is required, it's just plagiarism. Another of the Hollywood Protocols.\" \n\"At some point,\" the PFY says, \"we'll need to plug a keyboard directly into the back of a server – instead of just using the KVM switch – to allow us to access a drive, which will miraculously contain the data we want and not be part of a multi-volume striped and mirrored array.\" \n\"Wouldn't you rather copy 147 terabytes of data onto a 16 gig USB in 28 seconds?\" I ask. \n\"I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about,\" the Boss blathers. \n\"I can't copy it to that stick because I already have an up-to-date encrypted copy of the entire internet on it, using a special compression algorithm that only computer scientists on the dark web know about.\" \n\"Oh yes, that's right. Is that the same USB stick that has the access backdoors for connecting to any computer system in the world?\" \n\"The very same,\" the PFY says. \nThe Boss just sighs, which I take to indicate his acceptance of being jailed for financial irregularities in the near future. \n... \n\"And this is Mark, forensic accounting, Harry, who specializes in fiscal oversight, James, our business process guru, and I'm David, lead auditor on this case.\" \nThe Boss shakes each hand and prepares himself for the worst. \nAnd the worst rains down upon him. Shabby asset control, no purchasing policy, improper receipting and inventory control, dated SOPs – you name it, we've apparently done it. Or not done it. \n\"I thought you were going to use the Hollywood thing,\" he snaps when we're out of the room to get coffees for everyone. \n\"The Hollywood Protocol?\" I ask. \"Yes, but when the PFY said he was going to have to 'jack into the Matrix to synchronize our competency payload,' that Harry bloke said it sounded like Hollywood Protocol to him.\" \n\"So he knows about Hollywood Protocol?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Apparently so. So we might have to use the actual Hollywood Protocol.\" \n\"What's the ACTUAL Hollywood Protocol?\" \n\"Cash.\" \n\"Wait, are you suggesting we bribe those guys?\" \n\"Absolutely not!!! I was suggesting that YOU bribe those guys.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Well, the PFY and I are just cogs in the machine. You're the one who's supposed to be monitoring all those checks and balances. On the plus side, it's white collar, so you'll probably only get two years of home curfew with the free ankle bracelet. While you look for a new job.\" \n\"How much are we talking?\" the Boss asks, checking the cash advance limit on the company credit card. \n... \nHalf an hour later, the Boss is happily heading back to his office after a quick trip to the cash machine and back, and a subsequent \"chat\" with our auditors. \n\"How did your meeting go?\" the Director asks as the Boss walks by. \n\"We used the Hollywood Protocol,\" the Boss replies smugly. \n\"The Hollywood Protocol?\" the Director asks. \"Isn't that the one where you use mates from the pub to pretend to be officials of some sort in order to extort money out of someone?\" \n\"Uhhh...\" \n"}

The 'before' when you bent the stick about 45 degrees? The 'before' when it was so hot you had to shut your machine down to let it cool off enough to unplug? Or maybe it was the 'before' when you plugged it in and your machine just hung?\" \n\"Yes, it had some TEMPORARY problems, but it's always come back!\" \n\"i.e. It's not reliable.\" \n\"It IS reliable, it always comes back.\" \n\"It starts working again?\" I ask. \"By itself?\" \n\"Sometimes. But sometimes you get it working – and I'd like you to do that now,\" the Boss whines. \n\"You remember last time – when we got it working – and we told you to back up all your personal files to another USB stick?\" \n\"Yes. I did that.\" \n\"Then you should use that other USB stick.\" \n\"Yes, but I edited some of the files on this stick, and I don't want to lose that work.\" \n\"Fair enough,\" the PFY says, in an uncharacteristic act of charity. \"I'll take a look.\" \nThe Boss hands over a set of keys with a USB stick – liberally covered in various kinds of tape – to the PFY. \n\"So ... let's see what our rescue software can see,\" he says. \n>SNAP!< \n\"Oh dear,\" the PFY says. \"I have accidentally snapped the USB stick off in the USB port of this machine that isn't even switched on.\" \n\"But that's only the USB bit isn't it. The chip bit is still inside?\" \n\"The chip bit?\" I ask. \n\"Yes, the chip bit that always comes out when the sides of the stick fall off.\" \n\"Oh yeah,\" the PFY says, \"I could probably solder that back on.\" \nThe PFY goes over to the work desk and switches the soldering iron on. And by soldering iron I mean the machine with a \"tip\" the size of a pound coin that we occasionally use for melting chassis open. \n>SIZZLE< \n\"Oh dear,\" the PFY says a couple of minutes later, \"I think I may have applied a little too much heat.\" \nThere's a definite \"ashy\" complexion to what's left of the Boss's stick, and the chip is no longer aligned with the pads on the board anymore. \n\"Well, at least you tried,\" I say. \n\"So ... I have to use my backup stick then?\" the Boss sighs. \"My work is gone?\" \n\"It would seem so,\" I nod. \"It's a bit like that time when you spilled your soup on you keyboard, then a bit of coffee on the keyboard, and then the soft drink on your keyboard. Along with all the crumbs and splinters of salt and vinegar crisps – on your keyboard.\" \n\"That worked for ages,\" the Boss says defensively. \n\"And then it didn't work,\" I point out. \n\"But then it worked again!\" the Boss counters. \n\"And then it didn't work.\" \n\"But then I changed the batteries, and it was working again.\" \n\"And then it stopped working. Again.\" \n\"And then your assistant broke it in half while plugging it into a machine that wasn't even turned on,\" the PFY says. \"Even though it was a wireless keyboard.\" \n\"Back off, man,\" I say. \"He's a professional.\" \n... \nTen minutes later, the Boss is back in Mission Control. \n\"Could you ... maybe take a look at this stick. I don't think all my files have been backed up properly.\" \n\"What the hell's happened to it?\" the PFY asks, taking the Boss's new stick from him. \n\"Nothing. It was like that when I found it.\" \n\"When you found it?\" \n\"Yes, it was on the platform when I got out of the Tube. It's a 16-gigabyte stick – and no one bothered picking it up.\" \n\"So let me get this straight. You backed up the data from a crappy USB stick to ANOTHER crappy USB stick.\" \n\"No, that one's a 16-gigabyte stick. The old one was only a 4-gig stick.\" \n\"And what do you see on the side of this stick.\" \n\"I dunno, some company name.\" \n\"This is a merch-grade stick that you found in a public place. The saving grace for you is that it's probably so corrupt that it couldn't install the virus payload that someone put on it.\" \n\"But my files are on it. Couldn't you get them off and maybe format the drive?\" the Boss pleads. \n\"I suppose I could give it a try – but I definitely won't guarantee I'll be able to recover them all.\" \n>SNAP< \n\"OH DEAR!\" I say. I have snapped off your USB stick in ANOTHER port of the machine that isn't switched on. \n\"But the soldering iron is still switched on!\" the PFY says happily. \n>SIZZLE!< \n"}

What customizations?\" \n\"They wanted to be able to bypass red tape.\" \n\"?\" the Boss asks wordlessly. \n\"They wanted an interface into an LLM that could parse CVs, references etc. from external candidates, but would also permit them to put a thumb on the scale of suitability.\" \n\"How?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Well, say you resigned and the Company wants to appoint a replacement.\" \n\"OK,\" the Boss nods. \n\"They'd feed your position description into the system, along with maybe some KPIs and characteristics of an ideal candidate.\" \n\"Characteristics?\" \n\"Yeah, you know, undiagnosed ADHD, little or no proven history in IT, short attention span, lack of attention to detail, low IQ, that sort of thing.\" \n\"Uh-huh,\" the Boss says, gazing out the window vacantly. \n\"But then they realize that the candidate with those characteristics is already on the staff, but because of the Company's appointments policy they're unable to simply promote him from toilet cleaning into IT management. They – sadly – have to look for candidates externally, which means that placement agencies – who troll these advertisements relentlessly – can supply a candidate to the AI matching service with a far lower IQ than our toilet cleaner, who fits the role even better! The Company has to cough up a finder's fee to the placement agency that gamed the AI by knowing its weighting algorithms.\" \n\"Really?\" the Boss asks, gazing at a bird flying by. \n\"Yes. So HR asked us if we could have a tweakable system.\" \n\"Tweakable?\" \n\"Yeah. Obviously no criteria that would cross any discriminatory lines, but hidden criteria, nonetheless, which would permit the perfect candidate to get the role without the underhand intervention of placement agencies.\" \n\"What criteria are we talking about?\" the Boss asks, returning mentally to the conversation now the bird's gone. \n\"Oh, you know. Criteria like: 'To be effective in the role, the successful candidate would require the initials S & P,' for instance.\" \n\"Wouldn't there be lots of people with those initials?\" the Boss asks. \n\"There may indeed be. But not too many whose CV would include a Bachelor of Advanced Pencil Sharpening in their academic record, and even fewer still who list couch surfing in their sports interests.\" \n\"It sounds a little primitive.\" \n\"Yes, but it guarantees the candidate you want.\" \n\"How can it guarantee the right candidate?\" \n\"Because of the matching switches.\" \n\"Matching switches?\" \n\"Yeah, switches like No Whiners, which looks through the CV and cover letters for people who turn over jobs too often or mention personality conflicts.\" \n\"I'm not sure you're allowed to do that. And I don't know how those switches would guarantee a placement. Surely HR and the department concerned would still have to review the CVs and cover letters of the top three candidates?\" \n\"Yes, but then there are the Poor Candidate, Ghost Candidate, and CV Rewrite switches.\" \n\"The what?!\" \n\"The Poor Candidate switch will supply the preferred candidate, along with the two worst applicants,\" the PFY explains. \"The Ghost Candidate switch will create two fake candidates (who will miraculously have found another role if they get offered this role) – and the CV Rewrite switch will take the two top preferred candidates and adjust their documentation accordingly.\" \n\"Adjust the documentation in what way?\" the Boss asks. \n\"The CV might mention a couple of three-year 'appointments' with His Majesty's Prison service. The cover letter might highlight the healing powers of psilocybin, their standing as a sovereign citizen (as guaranteed under Magna Carta), and ask about the possibility of permanently parking their house bus outside the building to make it easier for them to get to work and shower in the mornings.\" \n\"And this works, does it?\" \n\"Oh yeah. But to eliminate doubt, we also have Power Words.\" \n\"Power Words?\" \n\"Yeah, like BRITISH STEEL. If you mention BRITISH STEEL in your CV, you're guaranteed to be in the top three. Mention JUGULATOR, maybe as a band you used to play the accordion for in college, and you'll instantly be the preferred candidate.\" \n\"I see. Well, I think you're going to need to tweak the program a little because they're having some appointment problems.\" \n\"Really?\" \n\"REALLY. One of the new HR team leaders appears to have no skills at all.\" \n\"Steve?\" I ask. \"Who used to clean up the glasses in the pub across the road?\" \n\"It might be him.\" \n\"Steve?\" the PFY says. \"The lead singer of JUGULATOR, who used to work at BRITISH STEEL with the world-renowned keyboardist NOSTRADMUS?\" \n\"What's NOSTRADMUS do?\" the Boss sighs. \n\"It skips the appointments committee and goes straight to sending out the job offer,\" I explain. \"A job offer with a very generous redundancy package.\" \n\"As it happens, I've just applied for the Financial Oversight Controller position,\" the PFY says. \"I was the unnamed fifth member of JUGULATOR, also worked at BRITISH STEEL, along with NOSTRADMUS, and in my free time I like to work on building my INVINCIBLE SHIELD.\" \n\"INVINCIBLE SHIELD?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Create a job that doesn't exist and that no one asked for.\" \n\"You can't ...\" \n\"We can. And if one of us happened to mention REDEEMER OF SOULS, when applying for YOUR role, you'd be receiving redundancy papers by the end of the day.\" \n\"OK. So ... I'll be in my office if you need me,\" the Boss says, wandering off quickly. \n"}

Luckily, today, I have one of those more annoying things right here with me. The Boss is peering over my shoulder. \nIf there's one thing that can make a bad situation worse, it's an idiot making suggestions like \"Perhaps we should switch it off and switch it back on again?\" – as if they were the person that invented the Magic Power Cycle. \nFor, as every seasoned IT Professional can tell you, there is one situation where the MPC should not be used - the firmware update. Many an expensive piece of hardware has ended up as a shelf ornament due to a MPC. \nI look at the monitor, still 83 percent. \nWhich brings me to a personal bugbear - progress indicators. \nBack in the old days, a progress indicator was magical gibberish like \"FLASHING BIOS BACKPLANE,\" which only meant something to someone who knew WHAT the bios backplane was and WHERE the bios backplane flashing featured in the update procedure. Without that knowledge the continuous cryptic progress indicators served only to inform you that the system hadn't crashed. Yet. \nWe had a major leap forward with the \"-\\|\/-\" spinning wheel, which was like animated magic – but again served only to tell you that something was still running. \nFinally, someone introduced the idiotic percentage indicator, configured to use the least useful counter scale. Copying 1,000 files of 1K each, plus 1 file of 8 terabytes? Use number of files as the indicator, and watch it hang for ages at 99.99 percent. Applying a swathe of firmware patches? Just use the patch number, regardless of the wildly varying response times. \n\"Ooh, it says it's verifying,\" the Boss says. \nAnd then there's the \"real time\" progress indicator – with a countdown showing how long something thought the upgrade will take, ticking down until it gets to zero, then negative numbers. Who knows if it's completed or not? \nAnd all the while you can see the access LED on your USB stick still flashing irregularly... \n\"It might be verifying, it might not,\" I say guardedly. \"63 percent,\" the Boss says for the benefit of those of us who can't read. \"...75 percent.\" \nI let him continue with the percentage reporting as it prevents him from vocalizing his other thoughts. \n\"83 percent,\" he says excitedly. \n... \n\"Still 83 percent,\" he says, a couple of minutes later. \n... \n\"Should it still be reading 83 percent?\" he asks, after about five further minutes. ... \n\"It looks like it's stopped at 83 percent,\" he informs me, ten minutes after that. \n\"Just...\" I say, not wanting to jinx it. \n\"Okay, it's definitely stopped,\" the Boss says, at the 40 minute mark. \n\"It certainly looks that way,\" I admit. \n\"So... Turn it off and turn it back on again?\" \n\"Hmmm...\" I mumble. \n\"?\" the Boss asks. \n\"We have here a Schrödinger's firmware situation,\" I explain. \n\"Huh?\" \n\"The box may be dead, or it may be alive - and philosophically speaking it is both dead and alive. However, once I power cycle it, it will be one or the other – and most likely dead.\" \n\"How can it be dead – it was verifying?\" \n\"It was verifying, but it didn't complete verification.\" \n\"So what will you do?\" \n\"I've no choice. It's time for Quantum Superposition.\" \n\"By... using the quantum computer chip?\" the Boss asks, having, no doubt, been half-reading the technical section of the newspaper in the toilet again. \n\"No – I'll just swap places with a service engineer,\" I say, reaching for the phone. \nAnd a service call is made. Luckily the hardware concerned is new and is still under warranty. Luckier still is that the firmware patch is both a critical and mandatory upgrade, which closes that loophole. Reluctantly, they agree to send an engineer. \n\"What is this, the Model 150-HA or the 150-HAL?\" he asks when he arrives. \n\"The 150-HA,\" I say. \n\"It could still be the 150-HAL,\" he says. It's not on the label, but you can see it on the motherboard inside the case. \n\"What, and void the warranty?\" I ask, smelling that trap. \n\"Okay, I'll just open the case and check,\" he says. \n\"And I'll just take a photo of you opening the case,\" I say. \n\"Everything seems to be okay in there,\" he says, looking up from a motherboard with absolutely NO visual indicators whatsoever. \n\"And yet...\" I say. \n\"Have you tried powering it off and then back on?\" he asks, much to the Boss's satisfaction. \n\"No; the upgrade notes said not to.\" \n... \n\"Well, I guess we'll just have to...\" \n>click< \n... \n>clack< \n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \n\"Hmm,\" he says, after a good ten minutes with nothing but a flashing cursor showing on the monitor. \n>click< \n... ... ... \n>clack< \n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \n\"Okay.\" he nods \n>click< >clack< \n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \n\"Uuuhm.\" \n>click-clack< \n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \n\"Okay then,\" he says decisively. \n>click-clack< >click-clack< >click-clack< >click-clack< >click-clack< \n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \n\"I THINK,\" I say, \"that we should abandon our tests of the MTBF of the power switch and just get that unit replaced. Under warranty.\" \n\"Oh, sometimes this works,\" our engineer insists. \n...numerous clicks, clacks, and a burning plastic smell later... \n\"Well I think maybe we'll need to ship this back to the repair team,\" the engineer says. \"Maybe they can just replace the bios chip.\" \nI point out that I'd prefer to have a new replacement unit, with the mandatory critical update installed, rather than a unit which has been power cycled more times than one of Arne Larsson's pacemakers. \n\"Yeah. Well, we don't actually have any spare units,\" he admits. \"We've had a number of these failures in the past month, so...\" \n\"So?\" \n\"I... uh...\" \n\"So you were switching it on and off because?\" \n\"Sometimes it works.\" \n\"So you said. But you also knew that it doesn't work?\" \n\"I... uh...\" \n\"So we'll be getting a replacement?\" \n\"Uh, yes. I guess so.\" \nTen minutes later I get a phone call. \n\"It's our engineer,\" I say to the Boss. \"He's stuck in our elevator.\" \n\"Have you tried switching it off and back on?\" \n\"No. But I certainly intend to. After I check there's no firmware update I can apply to it. Maybe I'll keep trying the power cycling - because sometimes it works.\" \nThe scared shouty voice coming out of my phone is silenced as I end the call... \n"}

He wants us to go to another company and help their geek out with a server issue. \nDigging deeper we find that it's a personal favor, not work-related in any way. \n\"Five Pints,\" the PFY says. \n\"Each,\" I add. \nThe Boss makes a show of pretending to think this over carefully, then reluctantly agrees. The company concerned is an investment outfit that the Boss has his retirement money with. Whilst the returns are good, their technical problems have rapidly eroded the Boss' confidence to the point that he wants us to get them running long enough for him to get his cash out. Today. \n\"Oh, right!\" I say. \"Totally understand. Ten Pints.\" \n\"We agreed Five!\" the Boss quibbles. \n\"You know, I think we have that six-week long I.T. inventory to do,\" the PFY suggests. \"It's quite urgent too. Perhaps we should get onto that instead?\" \n... \nA deal is struck, and the PFY and I grab a cab to the company. Their resident geek, told to expect us, is waiting at the door. \n\"It's the main server we're having problems with,\" he says, as we ride up in the lift with several power-dressed investment types. \n\"Just through here,\" he says, leading us down a maze of twisting corridors, all alike. \nThe server room is small but amazing. Four racks of gleaming equipment humming away, connected in cable via streamlined cable management. \n... \n\"So this is all a front?\" I ask, after a minute or so of looking around. \n\"What?!\" he asks. \n\"The racks, the servers - it's all a big fake?\" \n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he says, confused. \n\"Please. I mean look at that cabling. It looks like it was put in by an OCD architect.\" \n\"And?\" \n\"And that never happens. I mean it might look like that on Day One, but after a couple of years it looks like an explosion at a spaghetti factory. And look at your hardware.\" \n\"What about our hardware?\" he gasps. \n\"None of them have their covers half off. Besides, you've got four G4 DL320s in there. Sure, the front bezels have been polished, but they're over 15 years old.\" \n\"There's a proliant 3000 up there,\" the PFY chips in, pointing at another old piece of kit with a red LED glowing angrily. \n\"Oooh look!\" I say. \"An aftermarket LED 'upgrade'.\" \n... \nA minute of silence passes, then finally the geek cracks. There's no server hardware. Nothing. Over the last five years the entire company operation has moved into online services - theoretically leaving our geek with no job. \n\"So what do you... do all day?\" the PFY asks. \n\"SOME days, I'll take a complete snapshot of our cloud infrastructure,\" he says. \n\"Once a month you mean?\" the PFY surmises. \"So what do you do with the rest of your time?\" \n\"I, um, manufacture outages,\" he admits. \n\"Manufacture outages?\" \n\"Yeah, I'll light up the RED lamp on a server and, uh, take a cloud service offline.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"Because then they'll call me and get me to fix it. I'll bring them in here, fire up a linux laptop with the Matrix screensaver, edit a JPEG with a Hex editor, pretend to find a virus signature or an internal consistency error, then 'fix' it and bring the service back online again.\" \nIt seems so simple now that he says it. \n\"And no one's rumbled you?\" \n\"They're too busy trading. None of them knows where the data lives, what services they're subscribed to, or what the underlying infrastructure is. Two weeks ago I told them the enterprise license for the English Language keyboard was about to expire and they'd either have to pay the £2,000 licence fee or they'd automtically be switched to the open source Turkish keyboard.\" \n\"And they okayed two grand?\" \n\"They okayed FIVE grand. For a three-year license.\" \n\"So... this is all you do all day is it?\" \n\"Most days.

You don't have any servers, you don't have any real work - AND THERE ARE THREE OF YOU - so you just make problems to keep yourself in a job?\" \n\"Yep, That's pretty much it.\" \n... \n\"I feel like I've wasted my life,\" I admit sadly, on the way back to the office after the \"server\" is back online. \n\"Me too,\" the PFY says. \nHalf an hour later I'm back in Mission Control when the Boss enters nervously. \n\"How did it go?\" he asks. \n\"Well it looks like they're up and running, but to be honest their hardware has some real issues, so if you were going to be getting your money out, I'd be doing it today.\" \n\"Really?\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Really,\" I say. \"The system management is appalling and I don't think their IT guy has a clue what's going on.\" \nThe Boss almost knocks the PFY down on his way out the door, but he's back again inside a minute. \n\"There's something wrong with my computer!\" he says, waving his laptop around madly. \"I need you to look at it now.\" \n\"What seems to be the problem?\" I ask, taking the laptop from him. \"Let's see, all looks fine to me... oh...\" \nThe PFY looks over, and shakes his head. \n\"Has someone forgotten to pay their enterprise English language keyboard licence?\" he asks. ® \n"}

They're gold if compared to the SME grade \"multifunction\" printers which litter our building. \nSome are owned by the company, some are leased, and a couple have complicated contracts which can only be cancelled on a harvest moon in a leap year by repeating the word \"multifunction\" backwards, three times, into rotary dial telephone, after calling the unlisted phone number of a squid farmer in East Bangladesh. And leaving a message. \nBut all types seem to be as bad as each other when it comes to functionality. \nHardware wise (with a couple of exceptions), the machines tend to be a reasonably reliable print engine with a completely new design of toner cartridge and an under-resourced controller board based on 10-year-old technology - with a couple of expansion ports to bring it up to the 20th (but not 21st) century. \nThey then partially implement every networking protocol known to man, badly, and release the thing to market. \nIt wouldn't be so bad if the Company had 30 MFPs of the same make and model, but that never happens. \nThis past week we've seen the acrimonious split of the coloured pencil office into the two new entities: \"Design and Style\" and \"Production.\" Design and Style got the printer in the divorce and Production got the microwave. \nProduction, wanting to twist the knife, put in an order for a newer and fancier version of the same printer, while Design and Style, feeling the sting, put two tins of sardines into Production's microwave - on high for 45 minutes. \nAfter someone stole all Design and Style's office chairs things really kicked off. \nIn any case, where there was one printer there are now two, about 10 meters apart. And because the stakes are so small, both parties demanded access control on their printers to prevent \"unauthorized use.\" \nSigh. \nAnyway, back to my problem. \nDesign and Style's printer implements  Access Control via Active Directory or an LDAP server, while Production's printer implements Access Control via Active Directory or an LDAP server. \nYes, I know, it looks the same, doesn't it? \nDesign and Style's printer will only talk to an ACTUAL domain controller - not Azure, but will happily talk to any vanilla LDAP server. Production's printer will talk to Azure, but will only talk to an LDAP V3 server with several non-standard extensions. \nAfter wasting a couple of days trying to implement a common access control method, I have called the printer company to get their \"Implementation Lead\" to come out and take a look. \nIn the background, the PFY has readied his heavy equipment disposal unit – a hinged plate in the floor of the lift which tilts up 7.5 degrees when the rods at the bottom of the plate engage with the base of the lift pit.   A device is loaded into the lift, sent to Basement 2, and once the lift doors open the equipment will roll its way over to the stormwater sump – a large hole with a couple of road cones and some flimsy Danger tape in front of where the heavy steel cover plate used to be. I'm not sure how deep the sump is, but I know for a fact that it can take half a dozen of Design and Style's office chairs without breaking the water line. \nYou've got to make your own fun in this job. \nThe Implementation Lead arrives in due course and explains how someone at Head office rewrote LDAP from the ground up – only better – and published it as a standard.  I try to explain what the word standard means, but he remains convinced that their LDAP is the one to rule them all. In the end, though, it turns out that this is a sales trip... \n\"You could upgrade the older printer with a new controller board - one that can talk to Azure,\" he suggests, gesturing at a cardboard box that he just happens to have with him. \n\"Which will cost?\" I ask. \nHe taps away at his phone calculator for a bit and then suggests a number which is about 80 percent of the cost of the new printer that Production just bought. \n\"You could trade in your old printer,\" he suggests when I reject his offer. \"I've got another of the later models in the van outside.\" \n\"Which costs?\" I ask. \nIt's our lucky day! An upgrade, with trade-in, will cost 90 percent of the new printer cost. \nDesign and Style are keen to go ahead with a new printer - probably only so they can tell Production that their printer was cheaper. \n\"And I take it you'll need some toner cartridges?\" the Sales Lead asks. \n\"No\" I explain, \"They've got a cupboard full of them.  Enough to last several years.\" \n\"Yeah, but I meant the new cartridges.\" \n\"No, it's the same model printer,\" I explain. \n\"It's a later version of the same model,\" he replies. \"The cartridges don't fit in the new model, although the new cartridges are backwards compatible with the old printers.\" \nOf course they are. \n\"So... We've got several thousands of pounds' worth of... useless toner cartridges.\" \n\"Oh we can take them for recycling,\" he offers. \n\"How kind of you,\" I say drily. \n\"There's just a small recycling fee.\" \n\"Of course there is,\" I sigh \nAn hour later, the new printer is installed and the config is copied over from the old printer. The old printer ready to go, with a King's ransom of brand new, yet obsolete toner cartridges bungie-corded to it. \nI ride down in the freight elevator with the printer salesman. \n\"Oh, we passed the ground floor,\" he observes. \n\"Did we?\" I ask, stepping back off the floor plate. \n... \n\"Oh!\" he says, as he drifts out of the lift. \"I seem to be tangled up in the... \" \n>Splash< \nStill can't see those chairs... \n"}

They've looked at the Company as a whole and realized we need to add AI to our products. \nIf only I'd thought of it myself. \nI mean, the Company has a fair amount of A already, so all we really need to do is account for the staggering lack of I. The cherry on the cake would be if someone were to suggest... \n\"What we need now is a brainstorming session,\" the Boss suggests. \nJinxed it. \n\"I'd just like to highlight that there are no stupid suggestions,\" the Boss says, seizing the mediator role. \n\"Just stupid people,\" the PFY adds, to nip any ambiguity in the bud. \n\"And to be sure that everyone's on board with this session,\" the Boss says, \"I'd ask that you'd set your phones to silent and then put them in the tray at the back of the room.\" \nThat particular request has rocked the boat, as I'm fairly sure half the assembled IT\/beancounter crowd were looking forward to completing their Wordles. \n\"We should have an app,\" one of the HR minions says, before anyone's had a chance to settle into phonelessness. \n\"For our phones,\" another adds, in case there's someone who doesn't know what an app is. \n\"Great idea!\" I gasp, pretending to take notes. \"What would the app do?\" \n\"Oh, just stuff for the Company.\" \n\"Who would use the app?\" I ask, pen poised for the next pearl from the string of wisdom. \n\"All the staff.\" \n\"What about contractors?\" I ask, feigning further enthusiasm. \n\"Sure.\" \n\"And couriers?\" I continue. \n\"Why would couriers need the app?\" \n\"It depends on what the app does. If it just tells the user that they're late for work, then it's no use to couriers, but if it could tell whether a recipient were in the building or not, maybe it would be useful.\" \n\"Not for couriers,\" the HR guy decides. \n\"Fair enough. So, we have an app that does something, and staff and contractors can use it. Would all staff use it?\" \n\"They could.\" \n\"Would they have to use it?\" one of the support staff – who moonlights as a civil liberties enthusiast – asks. \n\"I shouldn't think so?\" \n\"We want the app to be nice to use,\" another of the HR crowd says. \"We thought it would help if we gamified it.\" \n\"Gamified it?\" I ask in gushy, pseudo-enthusiastic tones. \n\"Yes. Like, say the app could talk to your rubbish bin. And when you threw something in the bin you got a point for getting it in the bin, and you could collect points into a 'streak' for how many things you consecutively got in the bin without missing. That way, the office would be tidier and putting things in the bin would be fun.\" \n\"And what would you call the bin?\" I ask. \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well, you couldn't just call it a bin – you'd need to give it a fancy name to indicate it was smart.\" \n\"You mean like an eBin, or an iBin?\" he asks. \n\"eBin,\" I reply, \"as the Mac TV is prior art for iBin. So, we have our eBin, but wouldn't this just encourage people to leave their desks to be nearer to the bin – and thereby lower productivity?\" \n\"No, because the app could tell how far you were away.\" \n\"Right. So would I get more points if I left the office and threw it into my bin from a nearby office?\" \n\"Why would there be more points?\" \n\"Because it would require more skill to get it in from further away. It would be more enjoyable to reward skill.\" \n\"No, you'd have to be in your office,\" the HR guy says firmly. \n\"What about rebounds? Would there be points if, say, I bounced it off an office mate's head into the bin.\" \n\"No.\" \n\"It's not much of a game,\" I observe. \n\"The bin idea was just an example. We could do other things. We could gamify other things.\" \n\"Well, on that thought,\" the Boss says, \"why don't we split into small groups and each group come up with, say, five things that we could use an app for in the Company? And, if you like, maybe ways of gamifying the app to make the experience enjoyable for users.\" \nSmall groups form almost immediately, but for some reason no group seems to be enthusiastic about inviting the PFY and myself to join them. Not only that, but the groups quickly become circles of inward-facing chairs to protect the emerging ideas from prying ears. \nNot disheartened by this, the PFY and I form our own small group away from all the others as the discussions go on. \n... \n\"And how did we go?\" the Boss asks, ten minutes later, after calling the groups back together. \nA torrent of app suggestions surges forth from each group – some to do with integrating the cafeteria menu so that people can choose their future lunches, some to do with parking, and others just about office cleanliness and supply levels. \n\"Well, they all sound great!\" the Boss burbles happily. \"Simon, Stephen – what did you come up with?\" \n\"Ah, we didn't actually get around to thinking of any new apps,\" I admit. \"And I think we'd like to roll back our lack of enthusiasm for the eBin idea – as it turns out to be quite addictive.\" \n\"So, you like the idea now?\" the original proponent asks smugly. \n\"We do. And you're right, a streak is a lot of fun – even without extra skill requirements.\" \n\"And how did you figure that out?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Well, we spent the last ten minutes tossing mobile phones into the skip across the road,\" I say. \"SO much fun.\" \n"}

A dumb idea that will have to be quietly pushed into a cupboard in a couple of weeks and never spoken about again. A dumb idea that will – quite likely – lead to someone having a fairly short – and final – chat with HR. Heads turn toward the PFY and myself to see if we'll quash the idea before it engulfs us all in failure, but I'd just like to plumb the depths a little more. \n\"What do you mean, more AI?\" I ask. \n\"We need smart things. We're a smart company, we have smart clients – we should be smart.\" \n\"So... do you think that everyone who works at Nike is an athlete?\" I ask. \n\"I... no, I mean we should be smart.\" \n\"No argument there,\" I nod, \"but how?\" \n\"I don't know. But we should have AI in things.\" \n\"What things?\" I ask, trying to home in on whatever it is that has annoyed the Boss today. \n\"I don't know. But what about our vending machines, for instance?\" \nAnd there we have it. The company needs to get smarter because the Boss can't get the crisps he wants out of a vending machine. This is my job. This is where years of IT delivery has got me. \n\"How would we make them smarter?\" the PFY asks. \n\"You could make them work for a start. That spiral that turns to eject a packet of crisps. SURELY you could put a camera on the machine to SEE that it HASN'T DELIVERED A PACKET OF CRISPS before it stops turning?!\" \n\"OK, so a delivery camera. But you know the spiral ejector only came about to stop people shaking the machine to get chips out without paying.\" \n\"You could use AI to make a better anti-theft thing,\" the Boss counters. \n\"OK,\" the PFY says. \"Camera, and better anti-theft. Anything else?\" \n\"It's annoying when I go all the way to the machine only to find that it's run out of stock.\" \n\"By 'all the way' you mean out to the foyer?\" the PFY asks. \n\"Yes, but if it's out of stock I go down a floor and check their foyer, and if that's out, down another floor, etc. Sometimes the only machine with any crisps in it is the ancient one in the basement – because no one goes down there to get crisps.\" \n\"Except you,\" the PFY asks. \n\" I DON'T KNOW! I just know that sometimes that's the only machine with crisps in it.\" \n\"OK, so camera, anti-theft, inventory reporting. Anything else?\" \n\"Sometimes I don't have the right cash, but it won't sell me something because it doesn't have change.\" \n\"It does have a card reader on it.\" \n\"Yes, but I don't always have my card with me,\" the Boss whines. \n\"You want to run some sort of account?\" \n\"OK. But also the buttons stick. So to get Salt and Vinegar crisps I have to press A17 or A18, but sometimes the A key doesn't work, so you have to press it really hard, and when you do the machine thinks you've pressed AAA, which isn't an item, so you have to wait until it's told you that it doesn't have the item and resets itself.\" \n\"What about if the machine used the camera we added to see you and dispense whatever your favorite was?\" \n\"I... That would work I guess.\" \n\"Leave it with me,\" the PFY says. \n... \nIf anything, I think that dumb idea smell is getting worse. \n... \n\"So there it is,\" the PFY says, pointing to the machine in the foyer. \"I've installed a camera, loaded your credit card info, set your favorites, and all you need to do is approach it and it'll dispense one packet of crisps. It'll message you to let you know when it's out of crisps so that you know to go to another machine. Want to try it out?\" \n\"Yes!\" the Boss gushes. \nHe duly walks up to the machine and... \nNothing happens. \n\"Nothing's happening.\" \n\"Yeah, you need to be closer for the camera to pick you up.\" \nNothing. \n\"Closer...\" the PFY says, in tones reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter. \nNada. \n\"Closer...\" \nAt this point I'm visualizing someone trapped under a rather heavy vending machine. However... \n>Whirr< >tink< >plop< \n\"Well, it works, I guess,\" the Boss says, bending down to get his crisps from the delivery slot. \"But I had to put my face against the glass for it to see me.\" \n\"Yeah, well, the camera has to be able to see the spirals in the machine, so it points almost straight down...\" \n\"Could you make the lens a wider angle perhaps?\" the Boss suggests. \n\"I'll look into it,\" he says. \nAnd there are teething problems. With a wide-angle lens, the machine dispenses the Boss's favorite chips about 70 percent of the times he enters or leaves the office, so until the PFY can get around to fixing it he has to go and check the delivery slot – which brings the percentage up to a round 100 percent... \nWith that and him visiting other departments via their foyers, his credit card is taking a microtransaction hammering and the inventory levels are dropping. \nBut still, he does like those crisps. \nSeveral days later, I receive a call from the Boss. Well, a pocket dial. All I can hear is muffled noises, but a quick scan of the wireless mesh tells me his phone's connected to a WAP in the basement. \n\"Just... need... a hand...\" the Boss gasps, from his uncomfortable position, mostly under a vending machine. \n\"What happened?\" I ask. \n\"It fell on me.\" \n\"How?\" \n\"I don't know. The spiral stopped before the crisps came out.\" \n\"Yeah, there's no room for a camera in that model,\" the PFY admits. \"But there was room for the anti-theft mechanism.\" \n\"The anti-theft mechanism?\" \n\"Yeah, I connected the back legs to a linear actuator. If someone shakes the machine, it extends the back legs to prevent someone from being able to take stuff from the delivery slot.\" \n\"By tipping the machine over?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Crude, but effective,\" I admit. \"Now I assume you want us to rescue you?\" \n\"Yes,\" the Boss gasps. \n\"Well, we're probably going to have to get a jack,\" I sigh. \"They're about 50 quid.\" \n\"Can you reach your wallet?\" the PFY asks. \nOn the plus side, that smell's getting a little bit better... \n"}

The Beancounters heard those whispers and started their own whisper chain about wanting to move up a floor. \nThe Beancounters are practically fizzing at the prospect of an elevated view, while the HR crew is effervescent over the idea of having aircon with more settings than air fryer or arctic winter. \nBoth parties assume the PFY and me will be \"embracing the toenail clippings\" by ferreting under desks to remove and replace cabling, before physically moving anything and everything that has a processor in it. \n\"Oh, I'd LOVE to help,\" I gush, when the Boss raises it, \"but I've got all these firewall rules to change now. And the PFY will reconfigure the backup firewall – to save time.\" \n\"What needs doing on the firewall?\" the Boss asks. \n\"Oh, there's all the VLAN rule changes, the changes to the Link State Rules, DNS changes – it's not like it's just two lines of code.\" \nIt is, though. Or one, if I merge both VLANs together – because there's always time to do a job shabbily. \n\"Then we're going to have to reconfigure the distribution switches, the wireless LANs – I mean, that's going to be a hell of a job.\" \nThough with a single VLAN... \n\"So, what, they need to get someone in?\" the Boss asks. \n\"I suppose so.\" \n... \nThe thing about getting someone in is that a one-man-band outfit is usually cheap but slow, but with a large company it's done in a day but will cost more than a third-world dictator's embezzlement fund. \nI'm pegging we'll go SME, likely more S than M. \nThe next hurdle is which team they'll send – the A team or the B team. So we'll either get the shirt and tie brigade or some cosmetically waxed neanderthals. \n...A day later... \n\"I'll let the cafe know to buy more bananas,\" the PFY murmurs when the crew arrives. \nAnd he's right. The team leader informs us that each person has their own specialty, though it looks like the skills of bum scratching and asking stupid questions may be over-represented. \n\"So we're going to be moving some equipment then?\" one asks. \nTold you so. I'm pretty sure IT companies deploy these people to sites just to prevent them from damaging their own infrastructure. \nAnd the move progresses. As expected with a B team, the attrition rate is high. Why push a desk hard up against a wall socket with a data cable coming out of it when you can push 12 desks hard up against their wall sockets and break and entire batch of sockets? \n\"Looks like there's a network problem,\" one of them says, popping into Mission Control. \"It's probably a network switch thing.\" \n\"Yes, probably their insistence on requiring all four pairs to be connected,\" I observe. \n\"And we've moved all the wireless access points from upstairs to downstairs, and the downstairs ones to upstairs.\" \nI check, and sure enough, both sets of access points are now showing as \"down.\" \n\"Anyway,\" he continues, \"they didn't start up automatically so I factory-reset them so that they'd rediscover their settings.\" \n\"Great idea,\" I say, thinking about how we'd HAND-CONFIGURED custom hardware addresses into each of the WAPs to prevent them from being joined to the network if they were factory-reset by an enthusiastic Beancounter who'd watched too many YouTube videos. \nIn any case, I'm sure it'll be the matter of a moment for the PFY and myself to find the addresses, plug each WAP in, one at a time, and reconfigure them via their clunky, flash-based web interface, from a laptop running a back-rev browser that doesn't complain about certificate errors. \nOh, the fun we'll have! \n\"So the people are wondering when the network will be back? If it helps, I can take a look at your network switch config? I'd just need the management credentials.\" \nI could say that he'd get our management credentials when he pries them out of my cold, dead hands, but I foresee only one set of cold, dead hands in the immediate future... \nAnd the hits just keep on coming. While they're doing billable hours, they decide to upgrade everyone to Windows 11 after the move, which means around a quarter of our users have lost the only Windows interface that understood them, while another quarter are wanting upgrades to machines that can support Windows 11. \n\"These don't feel like my problems,\" I tell the Boss. \"I mean, I'm working on the firewall thing. And the wireless thing. And the broken sockets thing.\" \n\"One of the IT guys wondered if it would be easier for us to outsource the upgrades entirely?\" the Boss says. \n\"Which IT guy was that, Stephen or me?\" I ask. \n\"No, I mean one of the profes... the other guys,\" the Boss says, hastily backing up. \n\"Well, while they're here, we do need some machines moved around in the basement,\" I say. \n\"No we don't,\" the Boss says, knowing full well that they'd not need a return ticket for that trip. \n\"Well, maybe they could just bring the problematic desktop machines up here and put them over there,\" the PFY says. \n\"By the window?\" the Boss asks. \"No, I don't think so.\" \n\"Well, they only need to bring them to this floor.\" \n\"In the lift?\" the Boss asks again. \"That's not going to happen.\" \nSo we're looking a bit snookered. Unless... \n\"So, those network credentials,\" I say to our geek. \"The username is admin, and the password is, uh... Reichenbach. Here, I'll spell it for you.\" \n... \n\"There's been a terrible accident!\" I say to the Team Leader about ten minutes later. \n\"What?\" \n\"One of your people has fallen down the comms riser,\" the PFY gasps. \"He obviously didn't realize that we've not had floor grills at each level for years, since we ran new cabling. Cabling that seems to have completely covered the light switches!\" \n\"Is he OK?\" the Team Leader asks. \n\"I... don't know!\" I say. \"I mean, he could have fallen all the way to the basement. We thought it best to tell you straight away.\" \n\"HOW DO I GET TO THE BASEMENT!?\" \n\"Oh, the lift's just over there,\" the PFY says, helpfully. \n"}
